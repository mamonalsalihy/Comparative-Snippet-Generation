This hotel has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!	It's very close to the Bayside area, and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.	There were always taxi's at the hotel.	There was a lot of construction around the hotel, but overall it was relaxing for downtown location.
