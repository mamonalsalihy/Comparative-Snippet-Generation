The location of the hotel was in a very nice area, within a walking distance from all the main attractions of Rome and the city center with tons of restaurants.	The hotel was close enough to walk to all the sites - the Vatican, Colosseum, Forum, St. Peters, etc.	, but away from hordes of tourists.	It's also close to the Ponte Umberto, Piazza Navona, Ponte Cavour, and other popular shopping areas.
