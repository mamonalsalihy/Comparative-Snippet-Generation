The hotel is in an outstanding location.	It's easy to walk to the train station, as well as to all of the great sights and water taxi stops.	It's also 5 min from the Rialto bridge and close to lots of bars, restaurants, shops, and gondolas.	It's right in the middle of things, without being too crowded, noisy, or touristy.
