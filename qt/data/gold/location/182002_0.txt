The hotel is in a great location, close to the CN Tower, the museum, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, and the Hockey Hall of Fame.	It's also less than 10 minute walk to subway station.	Area was pretty cool too, great for shopping, dining & partying.	There are lots of restaurants in walking distance, with a great Chinese place right across the street.
