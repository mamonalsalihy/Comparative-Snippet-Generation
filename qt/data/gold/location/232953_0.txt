The location is outstanding!	It's not hard to find, and right in the middle of things without being TOO crowded and touristy but it's easy to walk to the train station as well as to all of the great sights and water taxi stops.	The hotel is also 5 min from the rialto bridge and close to lots of bars, restaurants, shopping and gondalas.
