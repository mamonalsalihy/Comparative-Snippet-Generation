The location is perfect: very nice neighborhood and the hotel is right on top of a subway station allowed easy access throughout Paris and to Versailles.	For places to eat, there are lots of nearby places such as contrescarpe,Rue Mouffetard, Cardinal Lemoine and Ile Saint louis....metro stop at place Monge which is just around the corner just have to remember lots of stairs at that metro station but it was okay with us
