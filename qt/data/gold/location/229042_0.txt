Very good hotel in an excellent location.	It is within a walking distance over Ponte Umberto to Piazza Navona or across Ponte Cavour to reach the popular shopping areas.	It is close to restaurants and all the main attractions of Rome and the city centre, including the Vatican, Colosseum, Forum, ST Peters, etc , but the location is away from hordes of tourists.
