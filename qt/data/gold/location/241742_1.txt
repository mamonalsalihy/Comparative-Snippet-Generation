Great location for all the sights, in a quiet section near the Accademia Bridge away from most of the tourist traffic.	The neighborhood is really really nice and cute and unique.	St Marks is within walking distance and the Vaporetto stop is just round the corner.	At the other end on the same street is the Zattere which is great for watching the sunset and having gelato.
