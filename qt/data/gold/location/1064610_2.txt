Location is great; you can easily walk to downtown shopping and restaurants, a quick walk to the metro, and a cheap cab ride anywhere downtown.	From the hotel you can walk to anywhere, including the Place de Arts, Old Montreal, Le Main, etc.	The metro took us all around town to visit the botanical garden, Jean Talon Market as well as a number of breweries on St. Denis.
