This hotel has a wonderful location down a quiet street away from the crush of the tourist hubbub.	It's a short walk from Zatterre and Accademia vaporetto stops.	It's near the Accademia Bridge, which is great for all the sights - St Marks is within walking distance.	The neighborhood this hotel is located in is really nice, cute, and unique.
