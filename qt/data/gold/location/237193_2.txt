The hotel's location on a quaint cobble-stoned side street was fantastic.	It's walking distance from historical Rome, such as the Colosseum and the Forum, and good for the rest of the central area.	It's also close to Cavour Metro station.	There's shopping and great restaurants down the street from the hotel.
