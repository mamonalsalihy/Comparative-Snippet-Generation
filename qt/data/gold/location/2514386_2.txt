The location is convenient to entire Midtown East, UN, and Grand Central.	The location was great-- quiet, in a nice, safe neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and transportation around.	There's also a shop on the corner that sold everything, a Starbucks nearby, and a dry cleaner across the street.
