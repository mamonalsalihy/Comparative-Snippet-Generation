The hotel is in a great location on Carlton/College Ave. and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.	There lots of little restaurants in walking distance (great Chinese place right across the street.).	public transportation is easily accessible at this location, too.	The location is great for shopping, dining & partying.
