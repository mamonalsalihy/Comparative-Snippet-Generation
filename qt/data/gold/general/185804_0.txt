Very helpful and polite staff, they will go the extra mile .	The hotel and rooms are modern and clean.	The room was beautiful and very spacious with amazing views of False Creek.	The comfortable bed and huge shower are highlights.	The Dockside Restaurant in the hotel has mostly great food and a wonderful view of the water.	The prices were in line with good restaurants in Vancouver.	This location is amazing- walking distance to food, drink, entertainment, and culture.	The whole hotel has a beautiful view of the waterfront.
