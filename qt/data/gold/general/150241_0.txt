Hotel staff were all wonderfully accommodating and friendly.	The entire hotel was very clean and the rooms even smell "fresh".	The rooms were large, with large beds, and modern, essential amenities that made it feel cozy.	The swim-up pool bar has great, grilled food and reasonably priced drinks; and the continental breakfast was plentiful.	(There are not enough reviews available to mention the location.)
