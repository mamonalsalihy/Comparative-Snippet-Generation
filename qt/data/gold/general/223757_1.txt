It was very nicely located, with two pools, two bars, some beach stores to shop in, and a 24 hours cafe downstairs with good food.	The rooms are very spacious and clean, featuring an ocean view, a sink and fridge, and a big balcony.	The front desk staff were all helpful and very polite, wowing with courtesy and skill.
