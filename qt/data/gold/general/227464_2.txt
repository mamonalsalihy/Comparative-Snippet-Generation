Reception, bar, and housekeeping staff were all delightful and helpful.	The hotel was comfortably clean and fresh.	The rooms were a good size, with very comfortable beds and great amenities.	The hotel is located next to Placa Catalunia, and close enough to get a great shopping and cultural experience.
