Staff was service focused and very welcoming.	Common areas of the hotel smelled fresh because of how clean everything was.	The rooms were comfortable and came with a fridge and a microwave.	Food, both hot and cold, was very well presented and fresh.	The hotel was located within walking distance to the French Quarter and felt very safe at night.
