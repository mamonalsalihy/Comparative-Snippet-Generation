The hotel is a good choice for those who want to spend more times out for fun and shopping, with an excellent rooftop terrace to relax at after a days sightseeing.	The bedrooms are very clean, minimally furnished, and modern.	Very helpful desk staff provided maps and excellent advice.	The restaurant serves breakfast only, but they do it very well with a great variety of food from cereal to smoked salmon.
