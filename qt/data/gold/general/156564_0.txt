The hotel staff created a lovely, professional, and overwhelmingly helpful atmosphere.	Every room was tastefully clean and spotless.	The rooms (beds and showers included) were very comfortable and filled with first class amenities.	The continental breakfast was average, but the restaurant itself is formal, with a terrific presentation and excellent food.	The hotel is close to a movie theater, shops, and restaurants on Robson St.
