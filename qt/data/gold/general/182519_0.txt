The staff was friendly and helpful.	Being freshly done up, the hotel rooms are cleaned daily.	The hotel itself is very nice, and the rooms are quite interesting(in a good way!	), spacious and nicely refurbished.	Breakfast at the restaurant was excellent as well and the food was delicious!	Very nice and modern hotel centrally located if you want to explore downtown Vancouver.	The hotel is a in a old building that is in pretty good shape, but there are very modern designs at the hotel.
