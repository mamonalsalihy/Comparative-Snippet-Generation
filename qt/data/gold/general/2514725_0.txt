It's a very simple and small lobby to check-in at this boutique hotel.	The location and its restaurant are fantastic.	The staff was friendly and clearly doing their best and going out of their way to accommodate their customers.	The rooms are spacious and extremely clean, with modern decor and furnishings, a TV, and toiletries and a huge shower in the bathroom.
