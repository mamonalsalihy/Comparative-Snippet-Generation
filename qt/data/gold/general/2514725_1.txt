The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful!	The hotel and rooms were so clean.	The room was gorgeous and very comfortable, although it could have been bigger.	But the decoration of the room is very modern.	The restaurant was very good.	The location is fantastic.	It's a very simple and small lobby to check-in, just adjacent to an excellent restaurant
