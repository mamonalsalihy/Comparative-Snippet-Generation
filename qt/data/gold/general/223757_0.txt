The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful.	The hotel and room was clean.	The rooms are very spacious with a nice oceanfront view and a gigantic balcony!	Pool bar is great and food is good, too.	The hotel has a perfect location.	It was very nicely located with a 24 hours cafe downstairs, 2 pools , 2 bars and some beach stores to shop in.
