The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Seattle within walking distance of Pike Street Market, shopping, library, concert hall, metro, and numerous fine restaurants.	Everyone on the staff from the valet parking to the front desk staff to the bellman go out of their way to be helpful and treat guests with kindness.	The comfortably-sized rooms are clean and nicely decorated.	There was some trouble with the plumbing and quality of the beds, though.	For food, the Tulio restaurant provides excellent food and attentive service.
