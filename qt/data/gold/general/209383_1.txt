The staff were very attentive, informative and friendly.	The entire hotel is very clean and neat, including the rooms, bathrooms, and pool area.	The rooms are nice, especially the bathroom, shower, and private balcony.	The comfy bed and tile floor are pluses, but the lack of fridge is a minus.	Good free breakfast with plenty of selections.	The pool was beautiful and heated.	The location was good and the price reasonable for Key West.	The parking is free, with no hidden extra charges.
