The hotel is in a great location with all major downtown attractions within reasonable walking distance.	The relatively small rooms are comfortable, clean, and convenient, with a kitchen and washer/dryer at your service.	The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful, and informative with any question you have to ask them.	Room service from the adjoining Moxie's Grill has good food, fast delivery and friendly service.
