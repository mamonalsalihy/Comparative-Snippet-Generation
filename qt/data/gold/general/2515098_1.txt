The staff is over the top helpful with any requests or questions, adding many personalized touches to our stay.	Overall the hotel and rooms were perfect, clean, and new.	The rooms were beautiful and spacious.	The bathrooms were great with a large soaking tub, a TV, and a separate double headed shower.	The breakfasts are wonderful and the food overall is great.	The location is fantastic, just steps away from Pike Place and the Piers.	We enjoyed the gym and spa facilities - the steam room was amazing.	The hotel feels very new and modern.
