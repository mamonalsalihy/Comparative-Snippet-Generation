The staff were excellent, very helpful, friendly and polite.	The room was clean, bright and airy, and the bathroom was also clean and modern.	The rooms were spacious, bathroom was wonderful, too.	The breakfast buffet was simply amazing - abundant, varied and delicous food, beautifully presented and offered with gracious, attentive service.	The location is good if you want to be away from the crowds of central Rome in the summer.	This is a lovely hotel with a fabulous pool and 2 Michelen stars in the restaurant.	The pool and garden is fantastic, too!
