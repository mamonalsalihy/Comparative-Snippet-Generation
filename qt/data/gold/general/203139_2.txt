The staff was very helpful, attentive, and accommodating, especially in recommending very good restaurants.	The hotel, rooms, and bathrooms were very nicely appointed and very clean.	The rooms were nicely sized, the beds very comfortable, the linens luxurious, and the bathrooms, while small, were made of beautiful marble.	Breakfast was great, with a good variety of food and a lovey view of the city from the rooftop terrace.	The hotel is in a wonderful location on the Via Veneto, with lots of good, reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance.	The free internet is nice, and overall the hotel is quite.
