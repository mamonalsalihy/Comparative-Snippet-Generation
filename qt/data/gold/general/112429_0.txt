The staff was courteous, helpful, and prompt, especially the Concierges.	The hotel and room were modern and immaculately clean.	The large rooms have amazing king size beds, stunning bathrooms, and good views.	The Dragonfish has great food, and they have a late happy hour for food and select drinks.	The hotel is centrally located.	Nicely appointed lobby.	The nightly room rate was excellent.	Parking in Seattle is a challenge, but worth it.
