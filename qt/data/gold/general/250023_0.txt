It's a very nice hotel in a great location.	The entire staff, from the doorman to the check-in, were very helpful and friendly.	The rooms are very clean and generally well-kept by the staff, and they feature refrigerators and comfortable beds to sleep in.	Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast but best avoided for lunch and dinner for its lackluster menu with inconsistent quality.
