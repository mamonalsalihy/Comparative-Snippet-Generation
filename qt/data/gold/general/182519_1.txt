The hotel is a in a old building that is in pretty good shape, and it's a perfect location if you want to explore downtown Vancouver.	The daily-cleaned rooms were very stylish, with flat screen TVs to entertain you.	Better than some 5-star hotels.	The service is very friendly and helpful with all one's needs, and the food is above average.
