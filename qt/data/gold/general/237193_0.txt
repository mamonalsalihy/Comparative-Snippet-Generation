The small hotel is minutes away from tourist attractions, shopping and a great restaurant down the street.	The staff at this hotel was extremely friendly, helpful and courteous from the minute a guest arrives, assisting in several languages and serving as guides when direction is required.	The room was very clean and of more than adequate size and comfort, plus the view is great.	Breakfast was good, with a selection of cereal, bread, wonderful croissants and jams to choose from.
