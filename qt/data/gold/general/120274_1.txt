All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and approachable.	Our room was cleaned daily and bug free, with fresh bedding and towels every day.	The pool was warm and clean.	The hotel is clean and neat.	The room was comfortable enough.	The breakfast was good, more than most free continentals.	This motel was better than the reviews stated in the last six months, and the price was pleasing.
