The entire hotel staff was very nice and helpful.	The room was immaculately clean, as was the hotel.	The rooms although small are beautifully designed, comfortably and stylishly equipped with almost everything, except perhaps a fridge.	Beds and pillows were very comfortable.	Restaurant in hotel is good for breakfast, but lunch and dinner have a lackluster menu with inconsistent quality.	It's a great value for the wonderful location - right in the middle of everything.	It's much better than many of the chain hotels in the area.
