Staff was helpful and friendly starting the minute someone walked in, recommended restaurants, and helped with touring of the city.	Hotel facilities are clean and well kept.	The small size of the room wasn't an issue because it was really comfortable.	Delicious breakfast food was available, but there was also small lunches provided.	The hotel is only minutes from many of the major attractions and restaurants.	There is an outside terrace on the fourth floor; perfect for relaxing after a long day.
