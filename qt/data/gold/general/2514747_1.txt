The staff were very welcoming and were always happy to help you with whatever was needed.	The rooms were also very clean, and clean every day we stayed.	Our room has a good sized, fully equipped, private bathroom.	The continental breakfast was decent with baguettes, croissants, cereal, yogurts, etc.	We were pleased by the location of the hotel.
