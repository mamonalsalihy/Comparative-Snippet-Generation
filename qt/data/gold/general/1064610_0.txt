The location is very central, and you can walk to anywhere, including the Place de Arts, Old Montreal, Le Main, etc.	The top floor gym and swimming pool are definitely worth checking out.	The staff is friendly and polite and were very helpful to recommend some great places to visit in the city.	The rooms, featuring amenities your average guest will find, and not to mention the whole hotel, is very clean.	There were some cleanliness issues with the bath and shower, though.	The food and the restaurant is good and room service very reasonable.
