The hotel is very elegant, located around the corner from a pizzeria and a two-minute walk from Pantheon.	The staff is very professional, helpful, and friendly, and they give suggestions for wherever one might hope to explore at.	The room was much larger than most European rooms, and very clean, with a great terrace/balcony to lounge at.	Breakfast each day was excellent with a variety of items served buffet style, and the hotel bar is really nice with great "happy hour" specials.
