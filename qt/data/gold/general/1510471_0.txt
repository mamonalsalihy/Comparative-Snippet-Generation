Staff is friendly and they even provided maps of the area and recommended dining.	The hotel was kept clean daily.	The rooms themselves were renovated with modern decor, have large, comfortable beds, and were very quiet; not to mention the huge bathrooms.	Food, both from the breakfast buffet and room service, was excellent, as was the fresh coffee.
