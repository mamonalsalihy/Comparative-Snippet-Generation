Service at the front desk is very friendly and even arranges taxi service; overall just helpful.	Everything was real clean, bright, and maintained daily.	The rooms were large, with comfy beds, but the furniture was dated.	The rest of the hotel could use renovations, it was all dated.	The hotel is walking distance to major attractions and public transportation.
