The staff was extremely courteous and helpful.	The wooden floors were all cleaned and maintained; as well as everything else in the hotel.	The rooms were beautiful and large, and the bathroom was immaculate.	There was a good, buffet style breakfast with particularly enjoyable cold meats, and with anything else desired.	The hotel is located close enough to the Vatican, Colosseum, the Forum, and St. Peters- overall a great location.
