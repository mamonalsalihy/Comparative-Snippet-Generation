The staff are friendly and exceptional.	Every room (lobby included) was very clean.	They are spacious, very quiet, and come with a coffee maker.	Though, the rooms are outdated in decor.	The hotel itself is conveniently close to the airport and restaurants.	There's a chocolate-chip cookie at arrival, and for the prices, the experience is a good value.
