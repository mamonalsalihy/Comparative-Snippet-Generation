Service was excellent; They were helpful, friendly, and gave great tips on where to go & how to get there.	Our room was very nice and large, with a lovely bathroom.	It even had a small provision for skylight.	Breakfast was ample and delicious if you like the typical European breakfast.	The hotel was situated in a great location, in a calm area away from the busy parts of the city, but still comfortable walking distance to everything.	It's a very good value for price.
