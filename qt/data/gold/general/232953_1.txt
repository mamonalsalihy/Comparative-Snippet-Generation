The staff was very helpful with all our dinner reservation requests and the questions we had about Venice.	The room, lounge, dining area very well maintained and spotlessly clean.	The room was well a nice size and well- appointed and the bathroom modern.	The breakfast was generous with a lot of choices.	and the coffee were wonderful.	The location is very convenient and within walking distance of shops.	The lobby is very nicely decorated with several little rooms to sit in and relax.
