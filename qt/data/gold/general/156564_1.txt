The staff were also incredibly friendly, efficient, and helpful, especially with ordering taxis and suggesting things to do.	The rooms were spotless.	In the bedroom was an amazing, with a comfortable king bed, top end linens, a great bathrooms, and other amenities.	The restaurant is quite formal, but the food is excellent, with good presentation.	The continental breakfast was average, but it was nice to get chocolates and cookies with the turn-down service.	It's in a wonderful position, near a nice market, a movie theater, the shopping on Robson Street, and plenty of good restaurants.
