This beautiful boutique hotel is at the heart of the Marais, with great shops, art, bars, restaurants, and coffee shops nearby to choose from.	The rooms and modern bathrooms are very clean and well-maintained, a good size by European standards and well-organized with a great view and comfortable beds.	Overall, the bilingual service staff was very courteous and helpful, and they'll reserve a spot on a bus for you if need be.
