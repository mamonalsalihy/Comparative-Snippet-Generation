The entire staff were the epitome of gracious, hospitable, and efficient service.	The housekeeper was always on hand to assist.	Immaculate building and rooms, which are regularly tidied.	The rooms have wonderful views of the canal, comfortable beds, beautiful interiors, and large, renovated bathrooms with nice amenities.	The food, both for the restaurant and room service, was nice and not too over priced.	The location of the hotel was great, within walking distance of the city center.	The design of the hotel is modern, cool and very trendy, with a lovely courtyard at the rear of the hotel.
