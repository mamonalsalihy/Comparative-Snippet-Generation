This is the perfect hotel for the New York experience, with a shop on the corner that sold everything and a Starbucks just around the corner.	All the staff was very courteous, helpful, and friendly, from the front desk to the doorman and the maid service, keeping the hotel well-looked after and spotlessly clean.	The air-conditioned rooms are a really good size, with a fully-equipped kitchen and nice beds to sleep on.
