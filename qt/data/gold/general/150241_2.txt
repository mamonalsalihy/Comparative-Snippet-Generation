The staff was very professional and helpful to us.	The hotel was very clean and well kept.	The rooms were spacious and comfortable.	There is a continental breakfast buffet included is great and there is a swim-up bar and grill which has very good food, too.	The location is excellent but the Pool was a bit loud from the planes as it is near the airport.
