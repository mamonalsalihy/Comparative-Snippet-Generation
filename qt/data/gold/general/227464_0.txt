The location is excellent, right next to Placa Catalunia.	The rooms are nice and clean and big, with great amenities and comfortable beds to satisfy.	Every member of staff, from reception to bar staff were extremely professional and helpful, and the breakfast was good, with a sufficient range of offers.
