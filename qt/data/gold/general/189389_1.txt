Everyone was the epitome of gracious, and service was attentive and helpful.	All the rooms were regularly tidied and cleaned.	They also overlooked the canal, the bedroom was romantic, and a superb shower with toiletries included.	The hotel had a trendy, cool, and modern design.	Every meal provided by the hotel was great, not too over priced, and the bar service is good.	The hotel itself is located a walk away from the city center and the shops in town.
