Tha hotel staff was delightful.	They were always willing to help answer my questions or provide recommendations.	The hotel, rooms, and bathrooms and clean and well maintained.	The room was a good size, quite, and had very comfortable beds.	Breakfast was good, with a sufficient range of offers.	The location was excellent.	It was close to everything, including shopping and the Placa Catalunia.	The value and reasonable quality makes it hard to beat.
