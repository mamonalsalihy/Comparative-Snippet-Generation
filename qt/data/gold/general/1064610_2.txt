The entire staff were friendly, polite, and helpful with recommending great places to visit.	The rooms and hotel are very clean, even the lobby bathrooms.	There were clean sheets everyday.	The room was standard.	The bed and linens are very comfortable.	There's an excellent working area, with internet and a superb chair.	There are issues with the shower and bath, and dirt around the tub.	The food and restaurant are good, and room service very reasonable.	Great central location, with all downtown attractions walking distance.	The swimming pool and Jacuzzi on the roof were nice.	Parking is extra.
