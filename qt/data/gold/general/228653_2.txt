The staff were very friendly and helpful.	The rooms are clean and well maintained.	The room was very good with a great bathroom and shower.	The restaurant serves breakfast only, but they do it very well with a great variety of food from cereal to smoked salmon.	There are also several nice restaurants and shopping near the hotel & the neighborhood is generally good.	Also, the roof top terrace was excellent a great place to relax after a days sightseeing!
