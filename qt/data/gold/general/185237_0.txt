The hotel staff, especially the front desk and Consignerâ€™s Lounge staff, provides timely and effective service.	The room and bathroom were well decorated , well appointed and extremely clean with fresh linen and towels everyday!	The room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable.	The bathroom was tastefully done, too.	The breakfast and room service was prompt and delicious.	The location is excellent for shopping and dining, as as it is literally on top of the Bloor/Yonge subway station.	The whole atmosphere at the hotel is positive.
