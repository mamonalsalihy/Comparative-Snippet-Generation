The hotel staff was knowledgeable, efficient, and always available to assist or give recommendations.	They make many time-consuming special arrangements and reservations for guests.	The hotel, rooms, and bathrooms were impeccably clean.	The rooms are large, with beautiful deco furniture, comfortable beds, and quality linens.	The bathrooms are small, but have great amenities, decor, and a jacuzzi.	The restaurant and bar is small but great quality, with modern Venetian food and excellent breakfasts.	Excellent location in a lovely neighborhood, close to everything, but away from crowds.	The hotel interior design is beautiful.	It's not cheap, but it's a great value.
