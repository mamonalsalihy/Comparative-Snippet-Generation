The staff are super friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome the minute we arrived.	The rooms and hotel are always immaculate.	Not a massive room, the bathroom was small, but had good lighting, also with all the amenities that we needed.	The beds were comfortable, too.	Great meals, too.	I raved about the Tulio restaurant, where I enjoyed one dinner and two breakfasts, with excellent food .	The hotel is conveniently located close to shopping and restaurants.	The location is also near the valley.
