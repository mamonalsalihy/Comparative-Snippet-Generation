The staff was super friendly and very helpful!	All rooms are clean and nonsmoking.	The room was beautiful and the beds were some of the most comfortable beds I had ever slept in.	They have an excellent continental breakfast that had a good variety.	Oh and the Dockers Restaurant is next door and it's excellent, too!
