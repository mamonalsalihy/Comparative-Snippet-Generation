Staff is courteous from the start and very helpful.	The hotel is clean all over, including the Jacuzzi on the roof.	It's located in a quiet, central part of the city.	Spacious rooms can hold a comfortable king sized bed; and each came with a great TV.	The food was decent enough but the breakfast was awesome.	The lobby is modern and a great place to hang out.
