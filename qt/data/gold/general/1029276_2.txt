The hotel is clean and beautiful all-around and close to the Bayside area.	The staff was extremely nice and attentive, from the front desk to the valet and the bellboys, always finding ways to go the extra mile.	The rooms themselves were very spacious, comfortable, and clean, with nice amenities.	The variety of restaurant food was excellent.
