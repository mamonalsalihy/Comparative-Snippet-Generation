Staff was hospitable and offered warm, helpful service to most every request.	Everything, including the pool, was very clean.	The rooms were comfortable, if dated, but the bathrooms are luxurious and the beds comfy.	The breakfast buffet provided abundant, varied, and beautiful food.	It's also a good location to stay away from big crowds in central Rome during the summer.	The hotel also came with a fabulous pool, an amazing restaurant, and a fantastic garden.
