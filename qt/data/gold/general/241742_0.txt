The hotel is characterized by a beautiful interior design, and it's located close to everything, yet slightly out of the crush of tourist activity.	The staff are wonderful and accommodating, and are ready to make all sorts of special arrangements for their guests upon request.	The beautifully design and furnished room was modern and quite chic and very clean, as is the bathroom and shower room.	The restaurant serves excellent full breakfasts, and their lunch and dinner menus are good too.
