The design of the hotel is modern, cool and very trendy, overlooking a lovely courtyard at the rear of the building.	The location of the hotel itself is great as you're within walking distance of the city center.	The rooms are very large and clean, with outstanding bathrooms, comfortable beds, and views of the canal.	The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, imparting impeccable service.	The food was nice and not too over priced.
