Staff was friendly all around and very helpful; eager to assist with everything.	The rooms were well cared for and immaculate.	The rooms were a good size, had a lovely Venetian theme inside, and a beautiful view of the canal.	Breakfast was great, with plenty of variety and fresh foods.	The hotel is perfectly located by St. Mark's square.
