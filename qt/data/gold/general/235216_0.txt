It is an older hotel, but in very good condition with lots of charm & character and located within walking distance to all major sights in the French Quarter.	The staff was very accommodating and friendly and went above and beyond with everything a guest might expect.	The rooms have all been clean and well equipped, featuring a refrigerator, a microwave, and comfortable beds.	The breakfast was presented very well, fresh and clean--the hot food was hot, the cold was cold.
