The staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating.	They give great recommendations for local food and activities.	Everything - common areas, bathrooms, bedding, hallways - was clean and fresh smelling.	The daily housekeeping service was impeccable.	The rooms were very comfortable, with a quite fridge and a microwave.	The beds were comfortable, but the pillows were small.	The breakfast was good, fresh, clean, and the right temperature .The location is excellent, safe feeling, and walking distance to all the major French quarter sights.	The hotel is older, but in very good condition, with lots of charm & character.
