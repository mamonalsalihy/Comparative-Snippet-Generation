All the staff was exceptionally helpful, courteous, and friendly, keeping the rooms clean and well-prepared.	The interior of the hotel needs updating, but the rooms themselves were very spacious, modern, and comfortable to stay in.	The hotel itself is conveniently located near the airport, a steak restaurant, fast food, and has a free shuttle service for broader access to Seattle.
