Staff were incredibly friendly which made our stay more comfortable.	Room was a clean and tidy suite.	I was plwasantly surprised by the room.	The size was ok and it was small, there was a small kitchen, living room and separate bedroom.	It also had big comfortable beds.	Room service from the adjoining Moxie's Grill has good food.	The breakfast was very good, too, and can be taken up to a leisurely 2pm at the weekend.	The hotel is also in a great location with all major downtown attractions within reasonable walking distance
