We found the staff very helpful, friendly, and accommodating.	The owner was very helpful in a difficult situation.	The hotel, bathroom, and rooms are clean and charming.	The rooms are small, but have nice showers, comfortable beds, and are quite.	Breakfast is simple but nice, tasty, and filling.	It's a Euro breakfast, so don't expect eggs & bacon.	The location of the hotel was superb; it was perfectly situated and you really knew you were in Rome,
