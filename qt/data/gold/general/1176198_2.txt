From the valet staff to the front desk, to the cleaning staff, everyone was courteous and very friendly!	The hotel and rooms were very clean.	The rooms were very nice and a good size for a city hotel.	They were attractive and well-appointed with super comfortable beds.	The hotel's restaurants and breakfast was actually good too!	The location was very convenient to a lot of major attractions downtown.
