This high-rise hotel has two elevators and one elevator was not working.	The location is within walking distance of fantastic bars and restaurants, the beach, and the Magnificent Mile.	The staff was very attentive and welcoming, and the spacious room (especially the bed and bedding) was fantastic and very clean, but in need of an update.	Bathroom was actually quite large and well stocked, and had a separate shower stall from the tub.	Only complaint was that it was to have a Continental breakfast included, which it did but a very MODEST one.
