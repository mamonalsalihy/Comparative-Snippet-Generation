This hotel was very nice and within walking distance of the Vatican, Colosseum, Forum, ST Peters, etc.	Staff were helpful in every way, and the attention to each request and question was efficient and treated with courtesy.	The air-conditioned rooms were very nice, clean, and comfortable, with immaculate bathrooms to boot.	Breakfast, which is included, was pretty good for a continental buffet.
