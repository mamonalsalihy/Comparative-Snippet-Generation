The staff at the hotel were excellent: friendly, accommodating, and efficient.	The hotel's cleanliness was exceptional, with spotless rooms and bathrooms.	The room was huge, along with the bath and separate shower stall.	The rooms are really nice, though they may need updating, and some of the carpet is stained.	The Whiskey Bar and Grill was disappointing.	Room service was excellent, but the coffee in the lobby was cold and week.	Continental breakfast was very modest.	Great location, close to fantastic bars and restaurant and a short walk from the beach and the Magnificent Mile.	The price was reasonable.
