The staff was helpful and friendly, recommending many places to eat.	The entire property is very clean, and the room was clean and comfy.	The rooms are large, with comfortable beds, and plenty of amenities.	The breakfast was plentiful and great, as was the food at the swim-up bar and grill.	The location is excellent, close to the airport, but the pool was a bit small, and loud from the planes.	It has free WiFi, and overall the hotel is an incredible value.
