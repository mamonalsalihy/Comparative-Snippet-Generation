The hotel, which is very close to the famous pike market and aquarium, feels very new and modern.	The front desk and lobby staff are super friendly and go out of their way to helpful.	The room was very spacious and everything was very clean.	The beds are comfortable, and the bathroom was great with a large soaking tub as well as a separate double headed shower and a TV in the mirror.	The breakfasts are also wonderful, offering a beautiful relaxation room with tea, snacks and water.
