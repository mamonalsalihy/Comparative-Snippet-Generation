It's a lovely hotel with a fabulous pool, garden, and lobby, and the location is good if you want to be away from the crowds of central Rome in the summer.	The rooms are lovely, comfortable and cleaned well, with enormous beds and TVs in the bathrooms.	All staff are warm, helpful, and bilingual.	The breakfast buffet was simply amazing - abundant, varied and delicious.
