Staff promptly caters to every need.	The rooms are immaculately clean.	They're also quiet, comfortable in size, come with nice amenities, a stunning bathroom, and amazing beds.	A late, small plate happy hour at the Dragonfish downstairs is amazing, although they can get busy.	The hotel is within walking distance to other great restaurants and even to the Space Needle.	The lobby is beautiful and is great for meetings or resting.
