The hotel, which is close to the beach, is very classy, with a good, small restaurant and rooftop bar with a great view.	The easy-going staff is friendly the minute guests walk in, imparting excellent, helpful service with whatever need or piece of information one requests.	The rooms are very clean and homey, with comfortable beds and a view of the beach.	The food at Hash, the restaurant just off of the lobby, is fabulous for breakfast.
