Service was exceptional and the quality was great!	The rooms are always clean, quiet and spacious with nicely appointed bathrooms.	The location is across the street from the airport, was within walking distance to a Denny's and other restaurants.	The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed was modern.
