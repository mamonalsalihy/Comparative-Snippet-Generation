Fantastic location, within walking distance of Louvre, Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville.	The hotel was clean and smart, and the lobby was beautiful, but the upstairs hallways were still needing to be refurbished.	The sizable rooms were immaculately clean and comfortable.	The formally-presented staff were all very friendly and helpful.	Breakfast is good, but after 9am the wait can be 20 minutes or longer.
