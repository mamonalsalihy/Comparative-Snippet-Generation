Staff were very friendly and helpful to show us the direction to places of interest and restaurants.	Overall the room- Smelled good, clean.	The bathroom is newly renovated and very clean and functional.	Our room was very large with a lovely bathroom with a small provision for skylight.	If you like the typical European breakfast, then it is, free, delicious and ample.	The hotel is located by the Museum of Natural History (Museaodi Storia Nautrale).	The hotel is also situated in a calm area away from the busy parts of the city but still in comfortable walking distance to everything.
