Staff received mixed reviews, but were overall considered friendly, attentive, and helpful.	The hotel, rooms, and bathrooms were very clean, with daily maid service and linen change.	The room was beautiful and airy.	The Breakfast was great and varied.	The location is excellent, away from the hordes of tourists.	It's just a short walk over Ponte Umberto to Piazza Navona, or across Ponte Cavour to reach the popular shopping areas.	The building is nice.	The restaurant was first rate.	However, some thought that the hotel is pricey for the quality of the room.
