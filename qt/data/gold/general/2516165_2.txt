The staff were helpful and friendly, especially in the spa!	The hotel is consistently clean and well kept and The rooms are luxurious.	The rooms have also been upgraded with new white comforters and new ruffle dusters.	The hotel also features kitchens so that we can prepare breakfast and eat out in the beautiful garden and lunch at the picnic area so that we can barbeque, but the food in wine country is also wonderful!	The location of the hotel is within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants.	The grounds are beautiful with the heated indoor/outdoor pools .
