The staff is very helpful and can provide good info for first time visitors.	The hotel and room was clean and it was good-size with great beds and nice linens.	The views were amazing, too.	Breakfast buffet is very good with lots of choices.	The location is very central and has beautiful views of the harbour.	The very obviously updated lobby and bar area is beautiful.	The pool and gym are very nice, too.
