There was genuinely warm staff who went out of their way to be helpful.	Every day, the rooms were cleaned and freshened, beds and all.	They also had large beds, flat screen TVs, and outlets within reach.	Food in the restaurant was excellent and the service itself was above average.	The hotel is situated in the heart of downtown Vancouver.	It is a cute place, with an old building but modern design.
