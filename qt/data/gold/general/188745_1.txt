The staff spoke good English and is especially friendly and helpful.	They helped with directions, recommendations, and making reservations.	The hotel was clean and well maintained, as were the rooms and bathrooms.	Beautiful rooms, with very comfortable beds and a good amount of space by European standards.	The bathroom was clean, modern, and the shower had good water pressure.	The location is amazing , in the heart of the Marais, with great shops, art, bars, restaurants, and coffee shops.	The price was incredible for such a great location.
