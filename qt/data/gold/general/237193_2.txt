Very friendly English-speaking staff goes extra mile for exceptional help to make the most of stay.	The facility is clean.	The room was small but perfect.	The breakfast buffet gets you ready for a day of sightseeing, with a selection of cereal, bread, wonderful croissants and jams.	The location is wonderful, minutes away from tourist attractions, shopping and a great resturant down the street from the hotel.	Another very nice feature is the outdoor terrace on the 4th floor.
