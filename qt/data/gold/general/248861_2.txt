The hotel staff was very helpful and accommodating.	The room was clean and the bathroom was very modern, immaculately clean.	They are a decent size, spare and design oriented having been recently refurbished with free wi-fi.	Buffet-style breakfast was good and plentiful.	The location is perfect, only two minutes walk from Pantheon and close to all the other sites.	This hotel was a very nice surprise as it was elegant.
