The entire staff were polite, professional, and answered all questions easily.	The hotel itself was quite clean and inviting, as were the rooms and bathrooms.	The bed was very comfy, with an ample supply of pillows, and the bathroom was well stocked with necessities.	The free breakfast is nice, with a wide selection of foods.	Free shuttle service was great, and check in was super easy.	It's very close to the airport.
