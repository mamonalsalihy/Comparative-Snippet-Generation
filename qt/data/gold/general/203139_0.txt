The hotel is beautiful, quiet, and fabulous, in a wonderful location on the Via Veneto.	The staff was very friendly and attentive to requests, possibly the best in Italy.	The hotel was very nicely appointed and was very clean throughout, with nice-sized rooms and clean, marbled bathrooms, and the breakfast is excellent.
