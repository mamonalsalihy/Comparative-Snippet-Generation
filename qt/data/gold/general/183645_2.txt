The hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and informative.	The housekeeping service was excellent and fast.	The rooms and hotel are very clean, but people dislike that there are no suite cleaning services (no fresh towels/linens).	Although small, rooms include a small kitchen, living room, and bedroom.	The bed is big and comfy.	There's a good view from the balcony.	Room service, breakfast, and Moxie's Grill next door all have good food.	The hotel is in a great location; all major downtown attractions are within walking distance.	The price is good value, compared to other hotels in Vancouver.
