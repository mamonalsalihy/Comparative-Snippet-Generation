The entire hotel is very clean and neat, with very large pool surrounded by palm trees, and the room layouts were unique and spacious, with an outdoor entrance, comfy beds and amenities, and tiled floors inside.	The free breakfast was excellent and a great bargain.	The staff was welcoming and really helpful overall.
