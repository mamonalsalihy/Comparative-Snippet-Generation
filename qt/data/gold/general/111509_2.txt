Staff were great at first impressions and staying friendly and efficient afterwards.	The hotel was clean and tasteful in every respect.	The rooms were a good size, nice but outdated; although the bathroom was quite large.	The food for the continental breakfast was to-die-for, even if the menu was modest.	Outside of the hotel were fantastic bars restaurants, and it was conveniently close to the Magnificent Mile.	The building has two elevators but one wasn't working, and the wait times were long.
