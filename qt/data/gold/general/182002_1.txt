The hotel, which is within walking distance to most major attractions, looked dated, like it needed renovations done.	Aside from that, the staff was very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to please and assist.	No room service, though.	The rooms are quite clean and spacious, with comfy beds and a breadth of amenities such as a kitchenette and free internet
