The service was excellent.	The staff was very pleasant and helpful.	The rooms were very clean.	The room was quite big, the bed was comfy, and it had a kitchenette with a good size fridge.	The hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.	The hotel was very nice, and looks like they are doing renovations.	The rooms need it.	It's not a high-end hotel, but it's great value for the price.
