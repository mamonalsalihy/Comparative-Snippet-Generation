The entire hotel staff was very nice and helpful.	The room was immaculately clean and well maintained.	The rooms although small are beautifully designed, comfortably and stylishly equipped with just about everything you could want, with comfortable beds.	The restaurant in hotel is good, too.	The best part was the location - right in the middle of everything.
