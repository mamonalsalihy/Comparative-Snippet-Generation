The staff were all very friendly, helpful, and attentive.	The cleanliness of the hotel was super.	The rooms had a cozy elegance but garish carpets and okay beds.	The Tulio restaurant was amazing, but the room service and breakfast, while prompt, were average.	The hotel is within five blocks of the Pike Street Market and other upscale shopping districts.	(Not enough information on the building- even in "other" to review.)
