The service is wonderful, the staff is incredibly helpful.	The hotel and rooms were clean and well maintained.	The rooms are attractive but well organised.	The bedroom was a good size and very comfortable, with a great bathroom.	The location is amazing - you are in the heart of the Marais, with great shops, art, bars, restaurants, coffee shops - all sorts.	This is a beautiful boutique hotel and the new decor is just soooo cute!
