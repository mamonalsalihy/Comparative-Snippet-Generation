The staff was very helpful with all of our questions, since it was our first time in Venice.	It was very clean and for the stay.	The rooms are large, very comfortable, with a beautiful "deco-design" furniture, and a great bathroom (jacuzzi...) with fine bathproducts.	The restaurant and bar is small but very good quality - modern Venetian food and excellent breakfasts.	Excellent location, close to everything, yet slightly out of the crush of the tourist hubbub.	The rooms are characterized by a beautiful interior design, as all as the rest of the Hotel (lobby, restaurant, main floor).
