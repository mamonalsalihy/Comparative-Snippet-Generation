Staff service was fantastically prompt, courteous, and great with dinner or tour recommendations.	Rooms were extremely clean, and the courtyard is immaculate.	The rooms are very comfortable, with wonderful amenities and clean bathrooms.	The building itself is historic, the pool is lovely, and the attention to detail was amazing.	Breakfast on the balcony was excellent, and the restaurant below was also great.	The hotel is in the best location in the Key West.
