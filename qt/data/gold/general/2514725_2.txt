The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, prompt, and very helpful when asked for directions or recommendations.	The hotel, rooms, and bathrooms are very clean.	The rooms were nicely decorated in modern neutrals, but show some signs of wear and tear.	The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious, especially the shower.	The restaurant was very good.	The location is fantastic.	It's a boutique hotel, with a very simple and small lobby, but it's quite "homey" in an urban way.	The price was very good.
