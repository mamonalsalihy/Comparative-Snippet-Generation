The front desk staff were polite and professional and answered all questions with ease.	From the shuttle driver to the restaurant workers, the whole place was friendly and helpful.	This is a very clean, very reasonably price, quiet, nonsmoking older hotel with lots of extras.	The bed in the room was so comfortable, with an ample supply of pillows, and the bathroom was very spacious.	The free breakfast is nice and there was a wide selection of different foods available.
