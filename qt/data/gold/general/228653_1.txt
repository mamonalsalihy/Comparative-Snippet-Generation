The very helpful, friendly staff provided maps and excellent advice.	The rooms were great; they were comfortable and very clean.	The hotel was modern and clean throughout.	The pool area was also cleaned everyday.	The restaurant serves breakfast only, but they do it very well with a great variety of food from cereal to smoked salmon.	The minibar selection was varied and not extortionate.	The location was very good.	The neighborhood is great, with great restaurants, bars, and shopping.	The roof top terrace was excellent, and a great place to relax after sightseeing!	It was an amazing stay.
