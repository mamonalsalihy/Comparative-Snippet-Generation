The hotel looks nice and is very well located, between the center and the museum district, near canals and the Heineken Experience.	Staff spoke English well and were very helpful and friendly.	Small rooms typical of Amsterdam, but spotlessly clean and well appointed.	The beds are very comfortable with feather pillows and thick duvet, and the free in-room safe is a good asset.	Hotel only does breakfast but this is fresh food, of excellent quality and variety.
