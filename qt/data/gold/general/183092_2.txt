The building, located centrally in Toronto, greets guests with a modern lobby and a beautiful fireplace.	There is a lovely indoor pool and Jacuzzi on the roof as well.	The rooms and bathrooms, along with the hotel itself, were extremely clean.	The rooms are a good size, with comfy beds, a TV, and a good AC to boot.	The staff was very professional and helpful, providing efficient and friendly service from the front desk concierge to the maids and bell staff.	The breakfast was also awesome.
