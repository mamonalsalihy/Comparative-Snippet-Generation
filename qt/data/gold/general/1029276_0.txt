The staff was friendly, helpful, and very quick.	The hotel, rooms, and pool were very clean, but the tables at the Hilton Honors lounge were not cleaned well.	Our room was nicely decorated, with great linens, a flat screen TV, and a beautiful view of the Miami skyline.	The restaurant on the main level was excellent, with a good a variety of food.	The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.	The express check out on the phone saved a lot of time.
