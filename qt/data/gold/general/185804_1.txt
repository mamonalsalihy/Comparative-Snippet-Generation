Staff goes the extra mile to be helpful and are very efficient at doing so.	Rooms, bathrooms, and lobby were exceptionally clean.	The rooms were huge, with comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms, and amazing views of False Creek.	The Dockside restaurant is superb; as is the atmosphere.	The hotel's location is ideal to get everywhere without driving- food, entertainment, and culture.
