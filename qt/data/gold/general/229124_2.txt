Service was always cheerful and helpful.	The rooms were spotlessly clean, including the beds and bathrooms.	The rooms also had a lot of modern amenities, comfortable beds, and a large bath.	Breakfast had plenty of choices and were of excellent quality.	Located in the center of everything, it was an easy walk through the romantic, safe area.
