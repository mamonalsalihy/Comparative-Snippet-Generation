The hotel is in a great location, near the happening spot of St Mark's square, and features very traditional Venetian decor.	Its staff is very friendly and efficient, welcoming guests with professionalism and politeness.	The rooms themselves are very comfortable and clean, with 4-star furnishings, double beds, and views of the canal.	The breakfast was very nice, comprising of croissants, fruit juice, rice krispies, muesli, prunes, ham, and cheese.
