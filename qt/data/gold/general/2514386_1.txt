The staff and doorman were helpful, courteous, and friendly.	Maid service was excellent.	This hotel is well looked after and spotlessly clean, as were the rooms.	The room was big and nice, but may need an update.	The bed was quite comfortable and the air conditioning worked great.	The bathroom was recently renovated, and the fully equipped kitchen was fabulous.	The location was excellent, convenient to midtown, and close to stores, dry cleaners, and coffee shops.	It's in a safe neighborhood, away from the hussle and bussle.	Though the rooms are a bit dated, the prices are very reasonable.
