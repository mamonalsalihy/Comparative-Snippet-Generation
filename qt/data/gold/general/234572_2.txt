The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, recommending excellent places to eat and visit.	They even assisted with phone calls for guests with language barriers.	The rooms and lobby are very clean.	The rooms were decent sized, with stylish modern decor, excellent showers, and comfortable beds.	Both the cooked and continental breakfast are great, but slightly pricey .	The location is great, quiet, but only a 5 minute walk from the metro station and a 15 min walk from the aerobus.	The hotel has a trendy modern atmosphere that's very cosy.	It's a great Price and has free WiFi.
