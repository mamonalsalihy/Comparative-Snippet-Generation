Staff were approachable and accommodating, especially when helping with directions around the city.	The rooms and bathrooms were reasonably clean.	The rooms were recently refurbished, though small, and had a great rain shower in the bathroom.	The breakfast buffet was excellent and there were great happy hour specials at the bar.	The Pantheon is within walking distance, as are the other ruins.	The building itself is elegant and very modern.
