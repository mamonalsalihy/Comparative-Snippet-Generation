Everyone from the valet to the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive.	The rooms were sparkling clean and new every day.	They were also attractive and comfortable, with large beds and bathrooms.	The food was very high quality in the restaurant, with the exception of the honeydew melon.	A lot of the major attractions downtown were easily accessible from the hotel.
