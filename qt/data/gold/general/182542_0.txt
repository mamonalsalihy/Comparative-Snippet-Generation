The updated lobby and bar area of the hotel are beautiful.	The location is central and has beautiful views of the harbor.	The rooms are clean and moderately-sized, with comfortable beds and linens, although the bathrooms are a little small.	The service was excellent from the concierge to the front desk, and the breakfast buffet is very good with lots of choices to offer.
