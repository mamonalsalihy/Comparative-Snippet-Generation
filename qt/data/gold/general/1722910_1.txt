The staff were pleasant and helpful, especially when pointing out places of interest.	Everything was very clean; the rooms even smelled good.	The rooms as a whole were very large, with a lovely bathroom, and comfortable enough for a good night's sleep.	The European style breakfast menu was ample and delicious.	The hotel was in a quiet location, but close to the Museum of Natural History and within walking distance to everything else.
