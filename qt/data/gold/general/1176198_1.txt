The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.	When a hotel strives for excellence in costumer service, it shows.	The room was very clean.	In fact, the entire hotel was so clean it felt brand new.	The rooms are spacious and attractive, with comfortable beds, a big shower, wonderful linens, and high quality amenities.	The business center with free internet was a definite plus.	The food was high quality, with good variety.	The honeydew melon in the salad bar was off, though.	The location was very convenient to a lot of major attractions downtown.	The price was less expensive than others
