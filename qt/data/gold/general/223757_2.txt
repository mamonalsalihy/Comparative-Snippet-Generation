The service is highly skilled and very friendly.	The rooms are very clean and kept with a welcoming aura.	Rooms also had a balcony with an ocean view, and were spacious enough to fit a full kitchenette.	Food from the pool bar was great.	Overall, the hotel had two pools, two bars, a twenty four cafe, and beach shops to prepare for the bay area/ocean.
