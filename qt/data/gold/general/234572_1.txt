The hotel, well situated for the Metro to FC Barcelona, has a nice trendy, modern atmosphere accentuated with wood and dark colors.	The English-speaking staff were extremely helpful and friendly, going out of their way for customers needs related to one's stay.	The good-sized rooms and bathrooms are very clean, modern, and comfortable, offering amenities such as a flat screen TV, minibar, and air conditioning, on top of the excellent toiletries in the bathroom.	The hotel provides a great breakfast (cooked and continental).	A bit pricey at 13 euros, but good.
