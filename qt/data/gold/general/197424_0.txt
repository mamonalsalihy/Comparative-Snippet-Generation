The staff was friendly and helpful.	The rooms and hotel itself is modern, extremely clean!	The rooms are standard Novotel rooms with great bathrooms.	There is also a nice bar and restaurant area and good breakfast.	Fantastic,central location, within walking distance of Louvre, Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville and close to all attractions.	All in all the hotel was clean and smart the lobby was beautiful but hallways upstairs were still needing refurbished!
