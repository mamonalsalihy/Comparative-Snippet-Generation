Staff members were always professionally friendly, efficient, and swift.	Everything was extremely clean, especially the rooms.	The rooms were big, if a little standard for hotels, but the bathrooms were great.	The bar slash restaurant is nice, with a good breakfast in the morning.	The Louvre, Notre Dame, and Hotel de Ville were all within walking distance.	It was a beautiful hotel, but the hallways need refurbishing.
