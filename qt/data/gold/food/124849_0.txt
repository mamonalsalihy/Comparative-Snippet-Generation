At the Marquesa hotel, there is the adjoining Cafe Marquesa which has to be the best restaurant in Key West.	It had wonderful food, and a creative chef.	There was wine and cheese on Saturday as well as the iced tea and coffee outside on a table by the beautiful pools and freshly baked muffins.	The Breakfasts are served in your room on your balcony was a wonderful experience, too.
