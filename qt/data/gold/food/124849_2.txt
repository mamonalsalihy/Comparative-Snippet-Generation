The adjoining cafe was the best restaurant in the Key West, with a changing menu of small plates and a creative chef.	There was coffee and tea and ice tea poolside daily, and wine and cheese available on Saturday.	Breakfast is served on the balcony.	All of the wait staff is efficient, pleasant, and overall excellent too.
