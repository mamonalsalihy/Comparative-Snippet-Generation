There is no cafe in house ( just the whisky bar & grill) so food only available via room service; We love the food on the fairly extensive room menu.	My only complaint was the lack of an ice machine on the floor and coffee in the room and the modest continental breakfast, but the complementary tea and coffee that is served in the lobby every morning is a nice touch.
