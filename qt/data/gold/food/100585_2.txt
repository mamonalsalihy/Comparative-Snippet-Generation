The Tulio restaurant had excellent food and attentive service, especially from the manager.	The free evening wine tasting is really special-- they served wines not available in stores.	The room service was incredibly delicious and relatively inexpensive.	The free Haagen Daz delivered by room service and morning coffee were a nice bonus.	The only complaint is that there are no vending machines.
