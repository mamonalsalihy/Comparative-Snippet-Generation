The Dragonfish has great food.	Every day it has a late happy hour for food and select drinks that can't be beat!	The prices and drinks are good, as are the small plates.	It would be wonderful to have a wider range of menu options to select from for room service.	The room service English breakfast and Earl Grey tea was not good.
