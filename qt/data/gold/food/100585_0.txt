The free evening wine tasting is really something special and popular with the hotel guests.	Get there early to avoid crowding.	There's no vending machines for quick snacks.	Room service is prompt, with free Haagen-Daz and a good morning coffee.	The Tulio restaurant has excellent food, attentive service, and a clubby atmosphere.
