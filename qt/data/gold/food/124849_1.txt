Poolside coffee in the morning, poolside ice tea during the day, wine and cheese on Saturday, and delicious meals are all greatly appreciated.	The baked muffins and coffee were great.	The adjoining Cafe Marquesa has to one of the best restaurants in Key West, with wonderful food, a changing menu, creative chef, and terrific small plates.	Every dish the table ordered was perfect.	The breakfasts are wonderful.
