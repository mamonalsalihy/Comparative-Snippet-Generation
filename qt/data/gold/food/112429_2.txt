The downstairs restaurant has amazing food and a wonderful happy hour small plates menu with agreeable prices and better food.	If they get busy, the hostess just takes your room number and calls when a table's ready.	The breakfast is great as well.	The room service is nice and professional, but the range of menu options and tea aren't great.
