The breakfast was excellent; lots of fresh fruit, eggs, meats, breads, cereals, yogurt, warm oatmeal, etc.	The food served to conference attendees is also excellent.	Room service was prompt and delicious.	The hotel restaurant was very friendly, though the menu and decor are a bit uninspired or dated.
