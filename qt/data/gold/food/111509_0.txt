Room service was excellent, eggs Benedict and french toast was to-die-for!	There are extensive delicious in-room dining options, including chocolate souffle.	The complementary tea and coffee that is served in the lobby every morning is a nice touch.	The included continental breakfast was very modest.	The only real disappointment was the Whiskey Bar and Grill.
