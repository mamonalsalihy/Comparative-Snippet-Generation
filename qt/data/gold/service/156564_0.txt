All the staff were extremely helpful, polite, and always had a smile.	The reception staff were particularly friendly.	They created a familiar, home-y atmosphere and assisted with ordering taxis and suggesting things to do.	They are well informed, professional, and nothing is too much trouble for them to accommodate.
