The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.	From the doorman to the front desk to the cleaning staff, they were eager to meet every need and answer any request.	Chris, the bell captain, was exceptional, he always greeted guests coming or going to the hotel from other activities.	They were always happy to suggest a new place nearby for you to try.
