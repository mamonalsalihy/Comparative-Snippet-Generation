The staff are fast, friendly & provide a good service.	The guest services stand was helpful.	The reception staff was mostly very pleasant and helpful, except for one older woman who was abrupt and unhelpful.	Otherwise, the housekeeping and ticket agents were the best!The directions given by the hotel staff were also very clear.
