The staff was helpful above and beyond what is customary.	Employees were gracious to us, from booking, to accepting a package for me before my arrival, to ordering food.	Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant was truly pleasant and helpful.	Parking attendants at this hotel were extremely professional: fast and very friendly and efficient.	Pet-friendliness was a plus.
