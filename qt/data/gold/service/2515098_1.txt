The front desk and lobby staff are super friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.	They always greeting us whenever we saw them.	The room service was quick & efficient.	The person who answered the phone noticed the sounds of a runny nose, and sent up a complimentary cup of tea w/honey!	They added many personalized touches to our stay!
