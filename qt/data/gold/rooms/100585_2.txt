The room was comfortably sized and stunning.	The bed was somewhat comfortable with a range of soft pillows.	The bathroom was small, but roomy and clean.	Very nicely done with a shiny black tile floor, granite countertop, fluffy towels and those nice Aveda toiletries.	Amenities included free wifi, blackout curtains, soundproof walls, and a refrigerator/minibar, which was noisy.
