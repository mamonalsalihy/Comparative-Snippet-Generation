The rooms were spacious for New York, and came with large, comfy beds.	Other amenities included a love seat, a functional (if small) kitchenette with a full coffee station, an ironing board, and plenty of clothes hangers in the closet.	The air conditioning also worked great.	And while the bathrooms were small, they worked great.
