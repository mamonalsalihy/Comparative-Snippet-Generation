The room was spacious, modern, and quite, with a lovely bathroom and a little balcony overlooking the surrounding rooftops.	The rooms were kept clean but some of the bathroom fixtures, even in the upgraded rooms, had some mold around the shower area.	The king-size double bed was greatly appreciated.	Wifi was free in the room.
