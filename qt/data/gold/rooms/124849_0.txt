The room was fantastic and clean, with a large bathroom and living-room sofa.	It's cozy, with lots of space and light.	The beautiful junior suites have a private porch and luxurious bathrooms.	Some rooms also have wonderful private balconies.	The amenities are good.	The beds are large and very comfortable.
