The room was huge and nicely appointed- spotless, roomy, and comfortable, with a great bed.	The large bathroom has a bath with a separate shower stall from the tub.	The only complaint was there were no plugs next to the bedside tables so our cell phones, which also double as alarm clocks, were on the other side of the room.	Only negative for the bathroom was no magnifying mirror.
