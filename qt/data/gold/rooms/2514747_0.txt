The room was quiet, with good views The bathroom was small but clean, and really nice for the hotel's lower price point.	It's well laid out and totally modern, with great shower pressure and a nice sized shower.	It also had a "razor point" where you can plug in a US-110 volt electric device without the need for a converter.	The free WiFi access is a huge asset.
