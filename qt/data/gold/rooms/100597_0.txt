The rooms are large and quite, you can't hear the planes taking off at the airport next door.	The beds are comfortable and large.	The bathrooms are mixed, some need cleaner doors and to be renovated, others seem clean and well appointed.	The ice and vending machines are close.	The coffee machine in the room is appreciated.	The lighting was insufficient, and an old basement smell was present sometimes.
