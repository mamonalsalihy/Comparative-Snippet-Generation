The rooms are very large, clean, and newly renovated, with beautiful decor, marble bathrooms, elegant linens, and Venetian chandeliers in every room.	The bathrooms are very nice and roomy, which can be rare in Europe.	They even had a small provision for skylight!	The beds were comfortable and the rooms have large closets.
