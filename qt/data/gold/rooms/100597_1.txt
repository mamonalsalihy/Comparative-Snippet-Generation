While close to the airport, it was quiet because of thick windows.	The beds were large and comfortable with lots of extra pillows.	The bathrooms could use some refurbishment.	Furnishings were complete with an ottoman, an easy chair, and a coffee maker.	A balcony gives a great view of the surrounding city.
