The room was fairly basic post-remodeling, but it was roomy and had plenty of modern charm, with incredibly comfy beds and a personal balcony to lounge on.	Amenities include an in-room safe, a small refrigerator, and a fireplace.	Privacy might be a concern in the bathrooms that have sliding glass doors, if one isn't travelling alone.
