The room itself was very nice and quite large by normal hotel standards.	The small kitchenette in the room included a coffee maker, microwave oven, and a refrigerator.	The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality, but the furniture is pretty dated, and the bathroom very tired looking and small.
