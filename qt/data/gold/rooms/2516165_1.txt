The rooms have luxurious decor, are spotless, and very comfortable.	The air conditioning unit is dismal, and the rooms are a little noisy.	The upgraded bedding, showers, and towels are very nice and comfortable, but some of the beds can be a bit stiff.	The night lighting, pools, and hot tubs are all delightful.
