Although they were a little noisy, The rooms were well decorated, clean, comfortable and had new bedding.	The beds were comfortable even if they were very stiff, and the lighting at night was delightful .	The air conditioning needs improvement, but the bathrooms have new tubs and shower stalls with fluffy towels.
