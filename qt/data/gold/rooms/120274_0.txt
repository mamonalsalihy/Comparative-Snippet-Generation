The rooms were, quiet and spacious but very basic with some odor.	They were recently decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms.	The room had twin beds, tv, safe, coffe maker, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, table and chairs, small dressing area, bath with shower.	The air con worked great and the room had a TV with lots of channels and a free digital safe, fridge and microwave.
