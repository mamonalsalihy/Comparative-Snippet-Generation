This hotel features very comfortable and spacious rooms, with balcony, coffeemaker, comfortable beds and were well furnished.	Some things that need work is the bad lighting, unkempt bathrooms and smell of mildew.	All that being said, the rooms are very quiet even though the hotel is close to the airport.
