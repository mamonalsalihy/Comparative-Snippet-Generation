The room was very basic with some odor.	It seems like it wasn't getting aired.	The room was recently nicely decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms with two large queen sized beds, window-mounted air conditioner mounted and came with safe, refrigerator and microwave.	The A/C is noisy, but works well.	Otherwise, the rooms are quite.	The beds are comfortable.	The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable.
