The beautiful garden-like grounds are in Napa Valley wine country where wineries are a wonderful attraction to visit.	The grounds are very quiet, very clean and have two mineral baths, a heated mineral jacuzzi and both indoor and outdoor pools.	The rooms are spacious and have not changed, which is good.
