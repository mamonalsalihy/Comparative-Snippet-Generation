This hotel is very grand and stands up to its name, with a beautiful, ancient, historical building that's been well-renovated.	The design of the hotel is modern, cool and very trendy.	The decor was just beautiful and the internal garden is lovely.	Lovely rooms, with opulent decor.	Another nice feature of the hotel was being able to go for a sauna and swim after a hard days sightseeing, which is very unique.
