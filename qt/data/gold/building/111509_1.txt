Hotel looks a bit tired on the outside, but once inside it is very nice and peaceful.	The lobby is small, and the bar on the ground floor is very good.	The nearness of the restaurant unfortunately makes for wafting smells in the lobby and two elevators, however, one of which wasn't working and made for longer wait times at the other one.
