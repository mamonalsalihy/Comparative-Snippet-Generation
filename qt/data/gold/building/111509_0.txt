The small lobby featured morning coffee and easy access to the on-site restaurant/lounge.	The nearness of the restaurant caused the continuous smell of cooking grease in the lobby and elevators.	Unfortunately, when getting off the elevator to the room, we were hit by the smell of cigarette smoke in the hall.	Some disliked the kid-unfriendly theme of the restaurant.	Hotel looks a bit tired on the outside.
