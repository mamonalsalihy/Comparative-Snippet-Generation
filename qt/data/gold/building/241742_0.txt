The hotel was unique and very nice.	In terms of aesthetics, the hotel successfully combines the "old bones" of the historic private home with very attractive contemporary art and design.	The room was gorgeous, with lots of lovely wooden features, unobtrusive and useful bits of modernity, and a terrific view over the rooftops of Dorsoduro.	The rooftop terrace is beautiful and full of chaise lounges.
