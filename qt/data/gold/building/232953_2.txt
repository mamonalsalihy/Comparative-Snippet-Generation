The hotel is very attractive.	The lobby is very nicely decorated with several little rooms to sit in and relax.	Out back there is an absolutely beautiful sitting and dining area.	The rooms themselves feature fabulous, beautiful venetian blue decor, with little sitting rooms and a sun terrace to boot.
