The very attractive building has a very generous sitting area near the lobby, with several little rooms to sit in and relax.	There's also an absolutely beautiful area out back for sitting and eating.	The room was fabulous, beautiful Venetian blue decor with a little sitting room and a sun terrace which we enjoyed even in winter.
