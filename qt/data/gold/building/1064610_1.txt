There is a indoor pool, a large spa and gym on a top floor and offered a nice view of the city, but there is not nearly enough tables and loungers there.	The gym looks good on the surface, but the equipment is cheap and flimsy, especially the treadmills.	And the elevator access to/from the parking garage is a bit confusing and inconvenient.
