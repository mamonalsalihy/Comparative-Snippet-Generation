Kimpton hotels have a sense of whimsy in attitude and decor.	The lobby is very small for the evening wine tasting.	Some rooms look right into the dark and ugly valley behind the hotel.	They even have an iMac in the lobby for guests to use.	There were a number of dogs but you would never know it - as we couldn't hear, smell or sense other dogs were there.	Rooms are warm and luxurious.
