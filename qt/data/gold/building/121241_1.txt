The hotel is nice from the exterior.	Inside, there was a gorgeous painting on the wall and the lovely arch made me feel like a real Geneviere of Camelot.	It was a great motel that also had swimming pools, hot tubs and an arcade.	The facility is very safe there with security cameras and entrances from the inside.
