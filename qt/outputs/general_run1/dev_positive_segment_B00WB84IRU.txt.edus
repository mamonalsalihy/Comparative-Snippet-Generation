this stuff smells nice
the coconut scent is noticeable , but much preferable to the chemical scent of most sprays
it does a good job
this one fits the bill for all
this and the lavender scented lotion sunscreen from alba are the only sunscreens
it worked perfectly
it is important
the cream does
especially living in florida
the best part about this product is
the nozzle does not clog either
