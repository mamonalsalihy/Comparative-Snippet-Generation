it is n't pungent or anything
affordable - easy to spread and hydrating , does n't leave any chalky residue
it does n't sting
the product lasts a long time thanks to the large bottle
the uv rays of the sun are converted to heat instead of getting absorbed by the skin
it was reformulated
there was no water runoff eye stinging even once
it does n't smell
apparently that violated amazons 's comment policy
