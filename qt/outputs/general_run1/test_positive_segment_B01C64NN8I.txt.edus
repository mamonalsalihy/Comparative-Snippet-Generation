the sun bum spray is more water resistant
it s environmentally friendly , contains no oils
this is totally worth the money , will buy agian
it dries clear and absorbs super fast without ever sweating off
styrene / acrylates copolymer , tocopheryl acetate , trideceth-6 , trimethyl siloxysilicate , vp / hexadecene copolyme     is a disgusting travesty
great sun protection , lasts a long time
it seems to be used up quickly
nothing against
