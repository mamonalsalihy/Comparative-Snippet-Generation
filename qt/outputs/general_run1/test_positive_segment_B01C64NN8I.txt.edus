styrene / acrylates copolymer , tocopheryl acetate , trideceth-6 , trimethyl siloxysilicate , vp / hexadecene copolyme . ... . is a disgusting travesty
it sprays evenly
the cream version works wonderfully
willing to go for better protection at a slightly higher price
it 's environmentally friendly , contains no oils
this spray applies well
it dries clear and absorbs super fast without ever sweating off
great sun protection , lasts a long time
