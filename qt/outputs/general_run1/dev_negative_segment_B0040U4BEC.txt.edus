for the record , it does not leave white filming or streaks
it s hard to get off in shower
only need to use a small amount
great for face and arms always exposed
by writing bad reviews for this product
while it does leave a barely seeable white film on the skin
elta pure is not meant to be a daily moisturizer
it does nt oxidize under makeup or bb / cc cream
