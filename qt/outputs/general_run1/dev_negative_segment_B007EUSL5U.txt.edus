the whole bottle is quite slippery
evenly absorbed without white streaking
the quality of the actual sunscreen is spot on
as the spray does not seem to be alcohol - based
it left a white gloopy mess
until it completely dried
it does n't smell like the other brands
well this is advertised
as being light and non greasy but unfortunately it fell short of its claims
it is a different viscosity than the tube
