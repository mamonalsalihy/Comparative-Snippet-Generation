it is harder
this product is expensive
this is a serious reaction , not a mild irritation
it also does n't have that weird zinc smell
since it 's a physical sunscreen
it does n't leave a cast
this product is not sticky
it is very painful and concerning
3 . it does n't feel any heavier
this is the only face sunscreen
it also does not leave a heavy white cast after application
buying
