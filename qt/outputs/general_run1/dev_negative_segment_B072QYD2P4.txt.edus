it 's tinted
it does n't feel oily
it does n't cover breakouts
the tint is n't orange or dark
others are difficult to rub in
due to the lightly pigmented tint
it did n't come off at all
the only downside is
useless to stand on its own
it is n't gunky
it has no scent
it really has no smell
even though the summer is over
super lightweight , no white cast ,
