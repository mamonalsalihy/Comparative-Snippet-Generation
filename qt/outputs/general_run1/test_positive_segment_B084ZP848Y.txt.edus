it goes on white
this sunscreen meets the bill
it does go on thick
it rubs in really great
while it 's great for the body
it works well as a block
with a little rubbing all is well
this item works great ...
a certain amount is absorbed
this stuff is awesome
it also rubs in better than other mineral sunscreens
it spreads great ... have n't had any issues
skin healed in eight
