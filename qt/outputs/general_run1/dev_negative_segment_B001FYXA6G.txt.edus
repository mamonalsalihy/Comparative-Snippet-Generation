it does n't bother his eyes
this has never
it goes on thick and white
without feeling all slimy
this will change
the spf 50 has a slight ` ` sun lotion '' smell
this prevented any sunburn from occuring
since using this product have
dissolves quickly , dries clear
it 's too bad
a favor and buy something
the price is a little crazy
for driving in traffic
the smell is not good either
