it has a pleasant smell
this sunscreen is great
this moisturizing sunscreen is medium consistency
this one is very lightweight & sheer
it has a mild rose scent
it 's happened both times
love love love it
it is water resistant
hopefully that can be managed with mattifying powder or something
it has coconut oil
vanilla like it says
it absorbs well into the skin
