it was misleading
the pain goes away
it contained zinc oxide
it 's thick
this is the only sunscreen
this presentation has a quimical barrier
nothing ruins a day on the jetski like sunblock
usually it would take multiple applications of eye drops
it was advertised as sensitive sunscreen
it still stings but not nearly as bad
