good for thinning hair and protects scalp from burning
it s actually kind of refreshing to spray now
otherwise , the spf seems to help on days
it was 100 % worth the money
it s nice to have a product
it sprays on pretty well and easy to rub in
great scent , not greasy or oily , one spray covers large area
half shaved and wanted some protection during the summer
great product
