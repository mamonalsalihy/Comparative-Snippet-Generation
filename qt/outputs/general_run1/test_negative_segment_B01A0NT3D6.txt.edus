still get an occasional pimple or two with stress , hormones , or new skin products
this stuff , however , stays matte
this stuff stands the test under makeup in high heat
the feel and finish was not ideal
actually blocks 90 % of the harmful effects of the sun
it dries up quickly and clumps up
it start to ball up and pill
an oily face is a complete thing of the past
