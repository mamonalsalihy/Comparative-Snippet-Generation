since using this over the past year
except that it does the job
average scent as far as sunscreen goes
without being greasy
like that the caps lock for suitcases
only one call out even after 20 min
coppertone is the og
no one got burned
than the hand applied one for sure
it 's a sprayed on one
it 's definitely more expensive
it does seem to fade after a few hours of activity
