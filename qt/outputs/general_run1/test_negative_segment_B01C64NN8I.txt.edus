only sprayed for a short one use
it is a little on the expensive side
it was that painful
the 3rd one does not spray at all - complete dud
way over priced
it was a bad mix
not a single incident of sun burn
first learned about it from cousins
like going to the pool or beach for a few hours
it does n't have a lot of unnecessary ingredients
it did n't show
