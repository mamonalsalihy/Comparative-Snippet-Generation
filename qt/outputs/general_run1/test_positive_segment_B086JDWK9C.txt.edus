for being non - toxic and very effective at uva / uvb protection
this is a wonderful product for the face
many people have had the same reaction
the skin does look shiny kinda oily
this sunscreen is absolutely perfect for people with medium
great dewy look and its light weight enough
this sunscreen would be good to try for any skin type
it has mostly safe ingredients , no obnoxious aroma
it s worth
