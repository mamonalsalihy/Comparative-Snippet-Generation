this is the only sunscreen
it 's far more expensive than the banana boat mineral foam
nice little bottle wo n't last very long but convenient enough
it does n't sting
it 's extremely difficult to find something
it is thick
it also does n't have any lasting fragrance
ever tried to get sunblock on a toddler
it 's super white , and not as spreadable
no more missing a spot
this is the only
