without peeling skin
it does n't feel heavy on the face
the local drugstore does n't seem to stock anything
some reviews say
no need to reapply often
exactly what it says
it feels like nothing
the next thing everybody needs badly
it 's not sticky or greasy
most creams with sunscreen are difficult to get rubbed into the skin
not drip off with sweat
hopefully it wo n't take so long to reach canada
