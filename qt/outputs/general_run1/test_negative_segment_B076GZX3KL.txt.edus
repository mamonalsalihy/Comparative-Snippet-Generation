light and sheer but gets the job done
as if there were no long handle
as for being invisible it definitely has an oily residue
the product did nt work like it had lost the aerosol in it
not s great new version at all
there is no scent or smell and no residue transferred to clothing
the sprayer & it is impossible to use
until the new formulation spray came out
just spraying wastes
