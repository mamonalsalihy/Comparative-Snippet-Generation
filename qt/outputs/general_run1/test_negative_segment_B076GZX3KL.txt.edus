the company said
exactly what its name states
as for being invisible it definitely has an oily residue
this item is weightless sheer mist
it 's horrible & neutrogena never should have changed the old sprayer
it took a week
this pack is also quite expensive
it is a little pricey
it also was notifying distributors and retailers to stop selling the products
it 's not all greasy
the product did n't work like it
