revision dej eye cream and a prescription retinoid followed by a bland moisturizer
the restore is slightly thicker and almost a tiny bit greasy
reminder , this is not water proof or resistant
it s not really matte , either
initally tried this as samples from the dermatologist
it is a lighter tint than restore
slightly silkier than the elta md tinted spf 46 too
it seems to cause / aggravate red spots
it will
