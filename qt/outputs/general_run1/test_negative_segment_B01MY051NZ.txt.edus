this is the only sunscreen
it 's something about the scent
this then hit shoulders and face with zinc stick
its kinda hard to wait at the amusement park
it does n't sting sensitive skin
barely touched the others
the scent is n't very strong
-- think 120 - degree desert sun
as it 's not super thick and gunky like other lotions
it does need to be reapplied
it did n't have the gross
