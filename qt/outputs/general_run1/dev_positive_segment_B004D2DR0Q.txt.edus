it worked great
it smells nice
this is one of the few lotions
it does have the sunscreen smell
it is a super light fresh scent
this is all
this has remained true no matter how many years go by
this seems to work all day
it does its job
it is not super thick
it 's just a really great sunblock
a lot of time on mountain streams fly fishing
this one is great
