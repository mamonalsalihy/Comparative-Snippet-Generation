these are wonderful
it smells nice
it 's a great product
this is pretty minor
it is not super thick
the skin absorbs it
the sunscreen itself is not greasy and rubs into skin smoothly and easily with little to no wait time for it
it does its job as a very effective sunscreen
this has remained true no matter how many years go by
most importantly , it does not carry a heavy smell
