the texture is the same as other sunscreens
it works like magic
it definitely helped
it tends to be a little red
it goes on light
it 's fantastic
it adds a bit of dewyness
it could work on lighter dark toned skin
it 's light weight
it looks white
the lighter color is just like the original bottle
it was great
it is about normal
summer season is here
blends well , nice finish
