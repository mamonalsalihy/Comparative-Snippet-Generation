it 's uncomfortable
this product is terrible
it hard to wash off , very oily
it was out if stock though
this sunscreen leaves a terrible white film
it should be a lot larger
a common drug store brand has a stick more than twice the size
since this is a stick form
unlike other zinc sticks this does not leave a white residue
it was a huge let down
it literally melts upon application
