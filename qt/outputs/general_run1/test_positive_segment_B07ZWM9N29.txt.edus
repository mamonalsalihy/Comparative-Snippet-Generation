it has a very nice fragrance
just tried for the first time
the kids love it too
it 's totally organic
quick without any white residue and the smell is awesome
as most sunscreens do
it smells amazing
the bottle went by fast
the coola mineral formula works better also
it arrived in plenty of time
this spray has the same active chemicals as the cheap store
it 's reef safe
the smell was great
