this goes on so easy and creamy
it feels like a well made product
la roche - posay is so worth the
as advertised and provides truly great sun protection
it absorbs very well into the skin
it dwipes off easily because of the oily texture
this is the first 100 + spf
great chemical sunscreen for sensitive , dry skin
this one is twice the price but worth it
it has a high rating
