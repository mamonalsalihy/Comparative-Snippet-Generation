it 's gone
it does n't smell
there 's no white cast , no pilling , and no greasiness
there is no caking
it does n't leave any white residue
it is undetectable visually or to the touch
it is not strong
masks are soaking the product up
fast absorption with no need to apply powder to try tame any shine
it 's expensive
this is the sunscreen
it does n't sit on the skin
