only one application needed
hard to find these days
bottle arrived broken on tuesday night
not having spread the sunscreen all the way
other sunscreen can take forever to apply
as it nears summer time
this is the only sunscreen
the product does n't feel slimy either
it 's hard to find spf 15 anymore
people look down on spf 15 lotions
