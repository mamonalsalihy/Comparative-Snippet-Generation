it 's so hard
it 's thicker than anything
it went sheer
the bottle is n't bigger
it is hard to squeeze out the bottle
there are no unpronounceable chemicals
it is thick
it is a very thick lotion
with this applied
it leaves a very noticeably white film
it was going to be thick
like this also magnified the sunburn
also knead well before use
it so far 3 times without any eczema flare
