aparte que esta marca no hace pruebas en animales
it was a mistake
skin never felt
it is clear
dry or ` ` coated '' . once dry could n't feel it
it 's expensive
this stuff goes on with a light mist
it can leave an oily film
it did n't feel sticky or heavy
the neutrogena sunscreen did n't work
the spray came out more like a stream instead of diffuse to hit
