this is one of the few sunscreens
bloqueadores solares del mercado estuve en playa mas de 8 horas continuas
this product has a really nice , smooth , rich texture
it s specifically made for people with oily skin
it smooths out nicely over the skin and dries to a matte finish quite quickly
it does leave a slight ashy / white film
also scores well on that ewg sunscreen rating with a 3
as
