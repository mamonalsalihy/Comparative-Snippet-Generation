it smells really good
it goes on like silk
it would be a good replacement
it has a beautiful velvety finish
the tint looks natural
this sunscreen feels like melted butter
like some mineral sunscreens do
coverage is great , no strong scent
this formula is super light and creamy in texture
this tinted sunblock goes on very smoothly
thanks to the lovely tinted formula
it is fabulous
it has great slip
it 's so
