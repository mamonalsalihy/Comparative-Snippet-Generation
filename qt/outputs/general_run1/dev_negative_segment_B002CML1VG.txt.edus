it was even more expensive per ounce
it stings like crazy for a long time
very disappointed for the price will go back
half the price , only comes in 16 ounces
the product picture of the label does not contain oxybenzone
even though this is rated at 60spf
too many sun protection lotions are too thick
this is a fall / winter sunblock
not for use on face - oily   make sure
as with
