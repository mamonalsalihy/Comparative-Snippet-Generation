it 's expensive
it stains anything
it stays dry
it also does not hamper make up applications
it sounds dumb
it is a bit greasy
as the name says
the only negative is the cost
plus it has no smell
it is very thin
la roche - posay anthelios melt - in sunscreen is a bit pricey
it can get everywhere
this does sting the eyes after application
the texture was nothing like its name
