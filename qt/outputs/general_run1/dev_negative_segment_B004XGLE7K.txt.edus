it tasted like battery acid lol
this is the only sunscreen
it does n't matter
not all of these products are honest about the ingredients in said product
it was less than 1/4 full
barely let any sun thru
the continuous spray makes
other spray sunscreens are hard to press down one - handed sometimes
despite being in the sun every day
the price is steep on comparison to regular sunscreen
once it was applied
