without holding onto a slippery bottle or dropping a cap etc
still rubbing it in
cons - weird to spread lol , like seriously just be prepared , this ai nt a normal ` ` cream ''
instead the label advertised stated zinc oxcide and titanium dioxide
this product definitely takes time
it 's job
it does n't applied evenly
as recommended by dermatologists for those at risk for melanoma
no where on the label
