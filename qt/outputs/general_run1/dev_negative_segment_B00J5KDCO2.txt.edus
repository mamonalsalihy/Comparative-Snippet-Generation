it does nt streak or ever look orange
the past three or four bottles have a product design flaw so bad
shipping / arrival was a day late
whiteheads are nt hidden very well by this product
2 bottles at different times and the color was different
this has nt bothered it or caused any breakouts
perfectly without being the least bit orange
the tint / lotion seems runny and separated
vs putting on some
