the color is the main problem
without the cakey makeup look
this is slightly tinted
it did n't relieve it completely
this does not lie
the only downside is
the past three or four bottles have a product design flaw so bad
it does not cause break - outs
it is very hard to say
it was expensive
this bottle just was n't it
it does n't cover flaws like makeup
it does n't streak
