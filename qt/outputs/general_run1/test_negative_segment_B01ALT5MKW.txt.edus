it 's not sheer at all ''
normally when buying a green sunscreen
whatever it gets on white
it soaked in shortly after
it does n't say that on the directions
the oils in this spray not only protect from the sun
yes it 's a pain
this light spray covers thoroughly
it is not clear / sheer ...
not truly natural , imo , so choose based on occasion
no one had any issues
