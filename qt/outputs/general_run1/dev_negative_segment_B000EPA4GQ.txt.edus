it 's gone
burns or looks fried
it 's not nearly enough
it 's not specifically for faces
it is not too greasy
others are n't tested on animals
as it certainly can not be felt on the surface of the skin
without breaking out the way
from being out in the sun
it would be immediately apparent
it is difficult to find the expiration date on most
it is not greasy or oily like
