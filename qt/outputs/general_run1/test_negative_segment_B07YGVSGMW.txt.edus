it does n't leave a white residue
this is it
likely because it is so occlusive
it does n't show anymore
this is n't it
the foundation would n't spread evenly or
the sun heats the product itself
this is the exception
it 's 100spf
it was a mistake
the slight white cast disappears very quickly
it leaves no residue
this one also does n't leave a white cast
spf would honestly be a steal
