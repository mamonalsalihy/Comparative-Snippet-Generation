the smell is horrible
it 's a fake product
tons of freckles and this stuff is mehh at best
the only possible drawback is the beautiful fragrance
almost feels like a edt deodorant
just a handful of uses and it 's almost out
it would always be oily and sticky
the advertising for this product was misleading
no greasy feel
kids refused to use it
not thrilled with this product
these sunscreens are all the
