this is exactly
this has a low spf
it is short lived
this is sort of a compromise level
than using nothing at all
the smell is slight
still has that same smell
this is no exception
it does have a slight greasy feeling to it
not overpowering like some
this is a chemical sunscreen rather than a physical barrier sunscreen
yes , this is only spf 8
this is the brand
on being outside
