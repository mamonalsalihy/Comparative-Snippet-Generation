the top part of the cover also cracked
it ends up
it is n't at all
it 's ok , but not impressed
the dispenser is defective
the product did n't go back into the container so be careful to only screw a little at a time
the box was badly damaged
it was completely unusable
it does n't take much heat
this product was not worth the price
it would be replaced
