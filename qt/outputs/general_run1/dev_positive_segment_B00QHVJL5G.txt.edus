as it serves as a light foundation
this cotz sunscreen blends right in with minimal rubbing
it 'll be great for fall winter
it has iron oxides in it too
it 's the best sunscreen
it blends in seamlessly into the skin
it 's the only one
with give most sensitive skin
also appreciated the added bonus of iron oxides for some visible light protection
the light tint is also nice
this works great
