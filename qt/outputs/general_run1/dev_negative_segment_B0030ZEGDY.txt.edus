this particular is 100 spf
since using this
without having to worry about missing any spots
this is the only sunscreen
it 's advertised then
it dries in a minute or two
not reapplied & it still worked
it does n't have a strong scent
the media could not be loaded
frequently it was
never burned wearing it
it does n't make
the entire day and nobody got burned
it must be caught in there
