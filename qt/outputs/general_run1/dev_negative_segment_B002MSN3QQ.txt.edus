by blurring pores
elta md tinted
it always felt so gross
the caveat is
it leaves no white cast
it does dissipate
it is not greasy
not wanting a knock off
tacky , globby , would not rub in
nor was there anything else
out when it has dried
it did sting a bit for the first couple days but not anymore
highly recommend for acne , sun - damaged , blemished , mid -
