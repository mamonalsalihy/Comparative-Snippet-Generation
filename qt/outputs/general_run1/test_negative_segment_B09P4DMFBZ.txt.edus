there is no harsh scent
it is a lotion
all that said
it does n't sweat off
there is a faint stickiness initially
it 's marginally better than spf 50
it turns a yellow color on white towels
than the 50 go with that
since it stays put over 6 + miles in hot weather
it does n't leave visible residue
vs. picking it up at the local store
this high spf is needed
all
