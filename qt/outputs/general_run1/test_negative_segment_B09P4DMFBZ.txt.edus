it s marginally better than spf 50
it does nt have an overbearing scent like the sprays
vs picking it up at the local store
the sunscreen resists sweat , heat , and water
it stays put , no dripping , no unprotected patches
those are not as effective as lotion
as a florida girl there is simply no escaping the sun but
tho the difference is marginal at best so
since it stays put
