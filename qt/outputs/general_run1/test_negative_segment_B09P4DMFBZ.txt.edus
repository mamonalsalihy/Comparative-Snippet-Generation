it had an application head
all told its a workhorse product
vs. picking it up at the local store
the manufacturer notes
there is a faint stickiness initially
all that protection comes at a cost
it was very faint
it stays put , no dripping , no unprotected patches
there is no harsh scent
since it stays put over 6 + miles in hot weather
it does n't have an overbearing scent like the sprays
