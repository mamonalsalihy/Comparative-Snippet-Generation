like it 's so expensive for those few ounces
no allergic reaction , does not clog pores
it is zinc - based and chemical free , but rubs in translucent
the outside of the tube began cracking
it did n't rub it
it does n't absorb
the white disappears within a minute
the only downside is
since that one only had zinc and titanium dioxide
it does n't leave a white film like other sunscreens
