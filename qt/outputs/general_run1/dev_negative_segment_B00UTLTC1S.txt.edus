it freaking hurt
sticky feeling was n't an issue
thankfully this one does n't
too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours
the can even sprays upside down
shocked amazon allows this misrepresentation
nothing to write home about
avobenzene is not reef safe
except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient
also is n't 30 dollars a bottle
even though there is a no return policy for this
