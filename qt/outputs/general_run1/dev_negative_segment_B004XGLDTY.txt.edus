the only challenge was the hotel floor
this is the only product
brand is n't reef safe
it was the worst
no one get burnt
this does n't irritate it at all
barely got a tan line
it is on the more expensive side
sprays tannin oil , browning oil , as well as the face sticks and lip sticks
it was clear
most sun screens did not work very well
it did n't go
