the clip on the nozzle is not secure
it s hard to get regular sunscreen
the scent is a little strong , but fades fast
some of the coola products are hit
honestly , it s not the worst or impossible to deal with
for the price it was not worth it
also the coating on the bottle is like wet spray paint
it s a pump spray for hair
without looking even greasier throughout
