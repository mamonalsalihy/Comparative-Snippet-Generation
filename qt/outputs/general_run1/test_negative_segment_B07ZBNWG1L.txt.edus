the scent is a little strong , but fades fast
the embarrassment of a peeling scalp
like pepper meets cleaner
scalp burn no more
it gets a little oily
cancer causing chemicals
for the price it was not worth it
the clip on the nozzle is not secure
it 's a pump spray for hair
without looking even greasier throughout the day
this product solves the problem
without making hair greasy
it 's not sticky
