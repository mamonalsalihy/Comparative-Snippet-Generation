as it is a physical sunscreen as apposed to a chemical one
it was one of the only physical sunscreens
the white cast disappeared
this is it
it did leave a slightly oily sheen
it does n't look
it is real thick
since the sunscreen gives a white cast
the shine also fades quickly
it 's the only cream
despite it being cloudy
it was a gel formula
most negative reviews are white caste and
