this is the only sunscreen
this then hit shoulders and face with zinc stick
it has never let
it 's not too greasy
this leave no greasy gross feeling or white cast
it does n't really smell like anything at all
this leaves no white cast , very sheer
it does need to be reapplied
-- think 120 - degree desert sun
barely touched the others
immediacy ordered this
it does n't sting sensitive skin
