it does n't go away
this is the only sunscreen
like it was even more dry
it had leaked on the box
it 's def sunscreen
only use this
immediately running into the water
it out on the boat and people do nothing
the brown cover peel off
only one bottle was ruined
the white streaks seem
sunscreen had leaked all over the inside of packaging
it 's own skin was peeling
every suntan lotion
