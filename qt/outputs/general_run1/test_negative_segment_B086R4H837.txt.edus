this is the only sunscreen
it 's def sunscreen
one of the bottles cover arrived
it falls short
it had leaked on the box
it is not subtle
like maybe it was damaged by heat or sun exposure
the brown cover peel off
it does n't go away
immediately running into the water
like it was even more dry
as lotion and everyone ends up getting burned someplace
it just takes a bit more time
