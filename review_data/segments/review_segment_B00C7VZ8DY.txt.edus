it . customer service is amazing
no allergic reaction , does not clog pores
this is the best sunscreen
it is zinc - based and chemical free , but rubs in translucent
well , it 's just great
it has always
the sun is fierce
it rubs in very well
it did n't rub it
just smeared it on , perhaps
it disappears on application
nice consistency , and lays nicely , pleasant consistency
it is a simple sun protection cream with no other benefits
the price is lower
the product is good ... . at first
something is wrong with the tube manufacturing
as the sunscreen gets used
it begins to form some kind of coagulation from the disintegrating tube
whatever is happening
the outside of the tube began cracking
it appears a little white
the white disappears within a minute
it did a great job
like it 's so expensive for those few ounces
this sunscreen is well worth the price
it works , does n't leave any chalky white streaks
no sun gets through
it does moisturize too
it smells nice
no white face look
this sunscreen has the best texture
it absorbs fairly quickly into the skin
fantastic , love it
the texture is nice and fluffy
it 's like whipped cream
it does n't leave much of a white cast like other physical screens
it was not effective at all
it 's just a product
for having this on the market
some people have said
the product is n't as clear
it would be
a sunscreen.this product works fine
it does n't leave a white film like other sunscreens
this is very heavy and white
this phobia of sunscreen made
it was recommended by a couple of ` ` top ten lists '' on the internet
the thing with olive skin complexion is
the best thing is
an ugly pimple would end up
it is very lightweight
it 's not a good product
it does n't absorb
since that one only had zinc and titanium dioxide
this stuff made
this sunscreen goes on white however after about 5 minutes
it gives such a beautiful dewy glow
just put on a little blush
it 's a little thick
it also layers very easily
the only downside is
it 's really difficult to get the pain to stop
this is not greasy
very hydrating and lasts all day
pros delivered on time + good service
this sun screen , looks good
hardy absorbs and lies on top of the skin almost like a second layer
