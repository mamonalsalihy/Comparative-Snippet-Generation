it 's a no nonsense , safe sunscreen for outdoors activities
no issues with reactions or burning
it holds up well
it spreads out well
no problems with reactions or burning eyes from kids or adults
it will grease up sunglasses
it has a slight smell
it 's not strong and pretty much gone after a few minutes
