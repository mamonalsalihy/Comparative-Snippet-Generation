this spray and ... do n't do that
it definitely is not safe for the face / eyes
item as described
pretty much anything above spf15 or 30 does n't really provide much extra protection

it 's likely
this will wear off well
the packaging is very good , with the twist cap
the mist is good
just because it does have a bit of greasy feeling for a while
it is not sunblock
