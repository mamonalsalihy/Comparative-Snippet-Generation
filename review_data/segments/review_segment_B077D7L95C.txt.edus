the kids loved this
ever tried to get sunblock on a toddler
yes , the foam smells great
the kids get a kick out of the ` ` foam '' . however
the product immediately gets tacky
without risk of giving the kids a rugburn
there are comparable products out there
summer has just begun
product came in box
this spray sunscreen is so easy
application is so ridiculously easy
this is especially great for a kid with sensory sensitivities
