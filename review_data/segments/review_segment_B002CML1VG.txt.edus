it blends in really well
european ones simply work better
this cream is zinc - free , not oily
too many sun protection lotions are too thick
as the name says
it melts into skin easily with no residue
it is such a shame
this caused an allergy
it 's for sensitive skin but not for all sensitive skin
this is after starting treatment for sun poisoning
there are complaints about ` ` oxybenzone ''
no oybenzone is listed as an ingredient either on the box or the tube
other protective sunscreen have zinc
this product is a keeper
for that it 's a solid 4 stars
