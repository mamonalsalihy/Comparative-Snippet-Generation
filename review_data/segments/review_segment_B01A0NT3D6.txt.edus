there 's no difference
it is a little expensive
it takes a while
this sunscreen is great
it does n't cause breakouts
it definitely feels bad
it 's not returnable
it 's not too bothersome
it 's a squeeze bottle
it 's not potent
it is noticeable during application
this is moisturizing enough
it feels slightly cooling
it is noticeable
it does n't last long either
it was oily
there are patches
this one 's a winner
this does not leave a white cast
the sun does hits
this is expensive
it is the only item on the market
it goes on easily
there is no scent
it seems moisturizing
this does neither
the formula of this sunscreen is amazing
it had great write ups
this sunscreen is perfect
it spreads perfectly
this is the best sunscreen
once it 's applied
it dries fast
it was just fine
consumer reports agrees
it 's not oily
it actually makes
it absorbs so fast
this one is great
it is very easy to spread
this is forgiving
this one is great
this is a bit thick
it does the trick
