both are great
perfect for boating season
the white streaks seem
it just takes a bit more time than some other brands
it 's reef friendly
this is the best quality lotion on the market
every suntan lotion has someone post a picture
it out on the boat and people do nothing
plus it smells amazing
it does n't smell like chemicals
