both are great
this is a safer option
it does the job
it 's reef friendly
this is the best quality lotion on the market
it smells amazing
it has a great texture
an goes on perfectly
it is not subtle
it does n't go away
it stays effective
it is actually moisturizing
this is the best sunscreen
it worked wonders
it is not too thick
it falls short
this is the only sunscreen
the shipping was fine
this is the only product
it has a mild coconut aroma
the underneath is yellow
it 's good
