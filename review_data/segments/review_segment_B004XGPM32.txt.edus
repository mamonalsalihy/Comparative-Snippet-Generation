well , it smells better than most beaches
it 's got that classic coconut - and - salt smell to it
just screams ` ` summer ! '' to a lot of people
it does n't produce that ` creepy ' feeling
a lot of sunblock gives some people
sun bum products are not reef safe
since 2020 usvi has banned the import
other companies also sell the legal product
it burned for hours between showers and and eyedrops
environmentally safe , easy to apply , protects for a long time
it smells good , too
highly recommend it
sun bum is a thick skin sun protection product
