product stays on in water
good spray rate and protects from the sun very well
there are no expiration dates on the bottles
sunblock definitely still works for a little while after expiration
it does begin to decrease in effectiveness after some time
these bottles were sitting on a shelf
every one of these bottles was broken / did not spray
sprays nicely and has a sturdy twist cap
it goes on easy
great to have for hot southern texas summer
