this one is sprayed on
it 's better
like it helps with the coverage
this is not quite so thick in coverage
it 's a sprayed on one
it 's definitely more expensive
than the hand applied one for sure
it 's definitely far more convenient
the package arrives well sealed
it does seem to fade after a few hours of activity
the pricing feels right as well
like that the caps lock for suitcases
no one got burned
this product definitely did the job
without being greasy
there is not too much
except that it does the job
easy to use , light fragrance , good protection from sun
great product easy to apply up and down
only one call out even after 20 min
heavily pollutes the water
this is a combo pack
last long and was good protection
average scent as far as sunscreen goes
good product and would buy again
than the liquid . goes on easily
it always come
it 's the best , cleanest , non - greasy protection
since using this over the past year
it will save
coppertone is the og
it 's a great sunscreen
there have been many
only use this
works are expected
the sun is afraid to come out
this is a classic high quality sunscreen spray
it is good value for the cost
it 's good
it feels cool on even with the sun
lotions are more effective and last longer
coppertone is great for tanning
this stuff works great
never burned with this
while using this product
great product the smell is great as well
great protection , easy to use , smells good
it 's good
easy to throw in a bag
it has good chemical and physical protective elements
the three pack is useful
