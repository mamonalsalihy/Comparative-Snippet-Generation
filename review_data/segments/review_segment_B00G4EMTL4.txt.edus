this brand.this product does n't seem as protective
as it has been in the past
difficult to press spray
it was not a pack of three
it was one
no one got burned

the spray was extremely easy to apply , with a twisting action on the cap
for opening and closing the wide pressing
gently depressing for a smooth and even coat
the spray feels like a light oil
most importantly , it seems very effective
this was far simpler

the sunblock stands up better after snorking or diving
the sunblock also has a pleasant scent
the sun is an issue
