it dwipes off easily because of the oily texture
this one is twice the price but worth it
la roche - posay is so worth the
as advertised and provides truly great sun protection
great chemical sunscreen for sensitive , dry skin
this goes on so easy and creamy
it feels like a well make product
it absorbs very well into the skin
this is the first 100 + spf
it has a high rating
