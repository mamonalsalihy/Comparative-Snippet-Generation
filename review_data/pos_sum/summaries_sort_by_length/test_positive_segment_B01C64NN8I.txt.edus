styrene / acrylates copolymer , tocopheryl acetate , trideceth-6 , trimethyl siloxysilicate , vp / hexadecene copolyme      is a disgusting travesty
it dries clear and absorbs super fast without ever sweating off
this is totally worth the money , will buy agian
the sun bum spray is more water resistant
it s environmentally friendly , contains no oils
great sun protection , lasts a long time
it seems to be use up quickly
nothing against
