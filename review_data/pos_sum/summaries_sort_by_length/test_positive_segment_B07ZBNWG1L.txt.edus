great scent , not greasy or oily , one spray covers large area
it sprays on pretty well and easy to rub in
good for thinning hair and protects scalp from burning
it s actually kind of refreshing to spray now
otherwise , the spf seems to help on days
half shave and want some protection during the summer
it be 100 % worth the money
it s nice to have a product
great product
