the lighter color is just like the original bottle
the texture is the same as other sunscreens
it can work on lighter dark toned skin
it tends to be a little red
it adds a bit of dewyness
blends well , nice finish
it works like magic
it goes on light
it 's light weight
it is about normal
summer season is here
it definitely help
it 's fantastic
it looks white
it be great
