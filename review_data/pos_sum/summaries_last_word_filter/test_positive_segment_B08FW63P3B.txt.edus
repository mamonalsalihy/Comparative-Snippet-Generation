it doubles well as a makeup primer and even a light makeup base
the heat and humidity are setting records relatively early in the summer
for a 2 oz bottle , it is a hint
the tint works well on fair to medium skin tone
this product does go on a little greasy
this one has a slightly warmer tone
otherwise , it is the best sunscreen
especially since it plays nice under makeup
