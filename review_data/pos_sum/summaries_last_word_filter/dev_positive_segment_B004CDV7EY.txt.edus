it seems to stay working the entire time
while holding a child in the other hand
the pump dispenser is sooo helpful
this stuff has be pretty good
it 's reef - safe
it 's certainly much stronger
this is the best
it goes on easily
the smell is nice
it has nice consistency
it be reef friendly
it is very reliable
