this bottle keep 5 people cover several times a day with plenty to spare after more than a week
it does have the sunscreen smell common with all sunscreens
solar sense may ultimately be the better protection
the smell is much better than most sunscreens
the copper tone leave an oil sheen
the fragrance is the traditional sunscreen aroma
it stays on in water and sweat
this seem to provide even better coverage
