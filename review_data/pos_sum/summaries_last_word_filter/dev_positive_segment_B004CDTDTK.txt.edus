just remember to re - apply after exercise or swimming
it is a spray and it s high uv rating
it goes on in a spray so easily and neatly
100spf sunscreen and this is the best so far
it s still pleasant and short - live
this is a miracle in a can
skin does feel slightly slick after application
this is a very good sunscreen product
this spray come through with flying colors
