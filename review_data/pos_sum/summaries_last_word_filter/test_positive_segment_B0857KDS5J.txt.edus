it is a great choice for babies & little kids or people with sensitivities or allergies
it s also a really nice choice for a primer under makeup
this sunscreen is very high quality and a thick consistency
it stays on for a good 2 hours surf session
pea size amount is enough for the face
as direct on a recent beach trip
it s definitely effective against the suns rays
