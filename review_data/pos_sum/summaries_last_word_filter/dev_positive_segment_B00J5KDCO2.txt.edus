the lighter color is just like the original bottle
the texture is the same as other sunscreens
it can work on lighter dark toned skin
it tends to be a little red
it adds a bit of dewyness
blends well , nice finish
it works like magic
it goes on light
it 's light weight
it is about normal
summer season is here
