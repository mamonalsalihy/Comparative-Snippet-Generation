styrene / acrylates copolymer , tocopheryl acetate , trideceth-6 , trimethyl siloxysilicate , vp / hexadecene copolyme . ... . is a disgusting travesty
willing to go for better protection at a slightly higher price
it 's environmentally friendly , contains no oils
great sun protection , lasts a long time
the cream version works wonderfully
this spray applies well
