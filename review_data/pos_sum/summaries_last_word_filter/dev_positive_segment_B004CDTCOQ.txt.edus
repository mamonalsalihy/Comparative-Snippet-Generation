love love this ! ! 5 stars for the quality and coverage hard to find at local stores
the date is lay out easy to read on the bottle     - long expiration date
it is so easy to spray on and applies literally in seconds
a new sunscreen with a different formula will work as well
seriously , it is the best sunscreen
