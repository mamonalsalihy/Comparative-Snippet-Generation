for a single person or even a couple the twin pack is a lot of sunscreen
instead it has a pretty thin consistency and rubs in very easy
the bottles have a build in grip on both sides
it goes on smooth and blends in well
it squeezes out of the tube very easily
the $ 8 per lotion is typical
this product is able to stop
