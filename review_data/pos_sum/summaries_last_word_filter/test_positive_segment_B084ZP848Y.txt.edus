it also rubs in better than other mineral sunscreens
it spreads great ... have n't have any issues
while it 's great for the body
with a little rubbing all is well
it works well as a block
this sunscreen meets the bill
it does go on thick
it rubs in really great
this item works great ...
a certain amount is absorb
it goes on white
this stuff is awesome
