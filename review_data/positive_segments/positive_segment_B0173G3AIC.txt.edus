it stays put through sweat and water   100
tip : always use it 15 minutes before exposure and reapply every 80 to 90 minutes
this product worked beautifully with no sunburn
this size is much more convenient to put in a purse or bag
with the grooved edges it s also easier to hold
honestly spend some time in the pool or ocean
it s one of the few sunscreens
this sunscreen has a pleasant light scent too
