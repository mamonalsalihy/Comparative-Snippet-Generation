this was perfect for poolside use
it actually felt nice on
it 's a mineral
this is great for sensitive skin
since the stick form is nice
this is better
the good part is
this is a nice stick sunscreen but not as moisturizing
this one came with good portion of the stick
it would be nice
the other supergoop suncreens are amazing
this is a very small travel size stick
pros : goes on easily
it 's all
