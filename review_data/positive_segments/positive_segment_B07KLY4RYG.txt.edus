it goes on semi - clear , smooth , non - greasy , easy
it 's easier to put on
it 's more hydrating than the neutrogena sheer zinc

the doctor recommended
there is a slight sheer white sheen initially
sunscreen is absolutely necessary
this product spreads easily
this cream was both mineral - based
for a comparison , it has the consistency of the eucerine daily protection , but less chemicals
it does leave a white cast
it came in a larger size
it 's very moisturizing , has a very subtle scent
it 's heavy enough
this is very thick and white
this is excellent sunblock with both titanium dioxide and zinc
this does the trick
this product delivers
this goes on easily , feels great
it is much creamier than the previous ones
very happy with the cerave sunscreen
this sunscreen is best for people with light skin
thai has great and healthy protection from the sun
it 's not bad
this sunscreen is amazing
the cream is extremely white
pros : great skin protection and does n't block pores
this product does not burn the eyes
for how it spreads and absorbs
it 's definitely moisturizing , but very white
the sunscreen goes a long way
this lotion is easy to spread
there is still a bit of a white to it
it seems to be doing a good job
it does make face white
his doctor recommended this product
this works great
it has a very white tint
