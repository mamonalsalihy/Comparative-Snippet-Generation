it also has a somewhat greasy / dewy look
as if it is too shiny or oily
it does n't leave a white cast
there is no sticky or tacy feeling
it burns a little upon application
this white cast is nothing
this product is n't sheer
it is n't scented
it has n't yet
it is so thin
it 's technically `
it 's tint
it 's not
it 's so
it feels heavy
