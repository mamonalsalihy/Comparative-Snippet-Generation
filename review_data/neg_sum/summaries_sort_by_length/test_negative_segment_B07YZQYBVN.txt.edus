the uv index during that time of the day be ` ` very high ''
it holds up to a massive amount of sweating
it is too early for that particular spot
unfortunately , it does n't last long
exponentially reduce risk for burns
it sprays a wide spray
it does n't rub off
there 's any bronzer add
this is the only sunscreen
it is nt streaky
the only thing is
it 's invisible
