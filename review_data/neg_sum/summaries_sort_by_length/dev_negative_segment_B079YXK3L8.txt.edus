there be nothing wrong with the other brand
like the tint is n't a perfect match
the tone can appear very slightly orange
yet covers small imperfections in the skin
it ` set ' for a few
the only thing with that is
it be hard to let go
it absorbs into the skin
this causes absolutely no irritation
this one does not
the drawback is
it 's tint
this is a
it be mortifying
