the scent is a little strong , but fades fast
for the price it be not worth it
the clip on the nozzle is not secure
it 's a pump spray for hair
without looking even greasier throughout the day
the embarrassment of a peeling scalp
it gets a little oily
this product solves the problem
like pepper meets cleaner
scalp burn no more
without making hair greasy
it 's not sticky
cancer causing chemicals
