honestly , it s not the worst or impossible to deal with
also the coating on the bottle is like wet spray paint
the scent is a little strong , but fades fast
the clip on the nozzle is not secure
for the price it be not worth it
it s hard to get regular sunscreen
some of the coola products are hit
it s a pump spray for hair
without looking even greasier throughout
