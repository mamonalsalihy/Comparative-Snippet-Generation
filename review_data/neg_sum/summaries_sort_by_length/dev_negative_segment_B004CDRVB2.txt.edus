it 's far more expensive than the banana boat mineral foam
nice little bottle wo n't last very long but convenient enough
it 's super white , and not as spreadable
it also does n't have any lasting fragrance
ever try to get sunblock on a toddler
it 's extremely difficult to find something
this is the only sunscreen
no more missing a spot
it does n't sting
this is the only
it is thick
