revision dej eye cream and a prescription retinoid follow by a bland moisturizer
the restore is slightly thicker and almost a tiny bit greasy
slightly silkier than the elta md tint spf 46 too
reminder , this is not water proof or resistant
initally try this as samples from the dermatologist
it seems to cause / aggravate red spots
it s not really matte , either
it is a lighter tint than restore
it will
