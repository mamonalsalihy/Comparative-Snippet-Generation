since it stays put over 6 + miles in hot weather
it turns a yellow color on white towels
vs. picking it up at the local store
it 's marginally better than spf 50
there is a faint stickiness initially
than the 50 go with that
it does n't leave visible residue
there is no harsh scent
it does n't sweat off
this high spf is need
it is a lotion
all that say
all
