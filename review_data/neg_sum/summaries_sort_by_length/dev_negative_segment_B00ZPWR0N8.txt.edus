this one has an expiration date of a few years
the expiration date on the box and the bottle match
the tint keeps it from having a white cast
it will become noticeable throughout the day
it does n't take a lot
except switching to the tint version
it is n't an overwhelming tint
once it 's apply
it is a pain
freckles have not return
it will n't
it does nt
like it is
