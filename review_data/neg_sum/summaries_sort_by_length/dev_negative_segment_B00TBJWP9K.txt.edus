it is because of its water feel or its chemicals , now every friend
it is n't thick but not runny either
it goes on ` watery ' and thin
it seems a little bit moisturizing
still use the tint 41 for
it is the first sunscreen
anthelios be the ticket
as all others do
it 's so expensive
it is very dewy
it is water
it be inconvenient
it 's pricey
the greasiness subsides
