most creams with sunscreen are difficult to get rub into the skin
hopefully it wo n't take so long to reach canada
the local drugstore does n't seem to stock anything
it does n't feel heavy on the face
the next thing everybody needs badly
it 's not sticky or greasy
no need to reapply often
not drip off with sweat
exactly what it says
it feels like nothing
without peeling skin
some reviews say
