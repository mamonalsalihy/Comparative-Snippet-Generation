like it s releasing actual hellfire in the form of a painful , burning , sticky rash of irritated skin and teensy - weensy blisters
the lightweight formula does not lay on top of the skin
since the cost per ounce is cheaper than the smaller
it be super sticky and icky on there too
the sun gets intense at high altitude
prepared to put it in several places
it does nt smell like sunscreen
