too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours
even though there is a no return policy for this
except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient
also is n't 30 dollars a bottle
sticky feeling be n't an issue
the can even sprays upside down
thankfully this one does n't
shocked amazon allows this misrepresentation
nothing to write home about
avobenzene is not reef safe
it freaking hurt
