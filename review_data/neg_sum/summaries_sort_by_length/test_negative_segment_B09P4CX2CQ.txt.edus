this is a chemical sunscreen rather than a physical barrier sunscreen
it does have a slight greasy feeling to it
this is sort of a compromise level
yes , this is only spf 8
this has a low spf
than using nothing at all
still has that same smell
it is short live
the smell is slight
this is no exception
not overpowering like some
this is the brand
this is exactly
on being outside
