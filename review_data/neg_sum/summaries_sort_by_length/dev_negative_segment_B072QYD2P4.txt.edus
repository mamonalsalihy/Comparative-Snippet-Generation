the tint is n't orange or dark
it do n't come off at all
super lightweight , no white cast ,
others are difficult to rub in
due to the lightly pigment tint
useless to stand on its own
even though the summer is over
it does n't feel oily
it does n't cover breakouts
it really has no smell
the only downside is
it is n't gunky
it has no scent
it 's tint
