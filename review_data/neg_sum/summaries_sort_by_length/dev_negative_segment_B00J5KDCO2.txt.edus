the past three or four bottles have a product design flaw so bad
it does not cause break - outs
it does n't cover flaws like makeup
the color is the main problem
it do n't relieve it completely
it is very hard to say
this bottle just be n't it
without the cakey makeup look
this is slightly tint
this does not lie
the only downside is
it does n't streak
it be expensive
