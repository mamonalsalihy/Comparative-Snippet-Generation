it does n't have that gross feeling from other other sun blocks
it goes on like moisturizer , leaves no white residue
even though this is consider ` ` natural '' sunscreen
this coola sunscreen smells awful - very chemical odor
still suffer some painful burns
without leaving the white residue
actually work in the future
it does not sweat off
this sunscreen is expensive
it be the product
