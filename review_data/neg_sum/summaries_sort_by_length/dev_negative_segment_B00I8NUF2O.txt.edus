it has ` ` cooling water '' in it
like a lobster then go back to white
it is n't thick but not runny either
hard to not look smear with residue
whereas physical sunscreens leave a white cast
it 's not the cheapest option
since 30 is the minimum recommendation
it is often hard to find
it be n't enough
as it is says
there is no fragrance
the greasiness subsides
it 's pricey
