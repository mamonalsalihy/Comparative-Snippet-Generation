like maybe it be damage by heat or sun exposure
as lotion and everyone ends up getting burn someplace
it just takes a bit more time
one of the bottles cover arrive
it have leak on the box
like it be even more dry
this is the only sunscreen
the brown cover peel off
it does n't go away
immediately running into the water
it 's def sunscreen
it is not subtle
it falls short
