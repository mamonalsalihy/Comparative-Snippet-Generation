upon first application there is a strong smell of oil
the tint does n't rub off on anything
a little on the olive skin tone color
about sonrei 's clearly zinq sunscreen is
the formula looks orange at first
it lingers for a long time
as it is so oily
like it will block everything
this is so thick this
the only negative will be
this is too much
... sharing this
it is mineral
