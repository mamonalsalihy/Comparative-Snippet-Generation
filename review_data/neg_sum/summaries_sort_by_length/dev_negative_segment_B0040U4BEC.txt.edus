for the record , it does not leave white filming or streaks
while it does leave a barely seeable white film on the skin
it does nt oxidize under makeup or bb / cc cream
elta pure is not mean to be a daily moisturizer
it s hard to get off in shower
only need to use a small amount
great for face and arms always expose
