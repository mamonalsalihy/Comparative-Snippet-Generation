a common drug store brand has a stick more than twice the size
unlike other zinc sticks this does not leave a white residue
it hard to wash off , very oily
this sunscreen leaves a terrible white film
it be out if stock though
it shall be a lot larger
since this is a stick form
it be a huge let down
it literally melts upon application
this product is terrible
it 's uncomfortable
