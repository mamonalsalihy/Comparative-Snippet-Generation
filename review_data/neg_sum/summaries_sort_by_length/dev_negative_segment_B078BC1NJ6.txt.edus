it does seem to fade after a few hours of activity
only one call out even after 20 min
since using this over the past year
average scent as far as sunscreen goes
like that the caps lock for suitcases
than the hand apply one for sure
except that it does the job
it 's a sprayed on one
it 's definitely more expensive
coppertone is the og
no one get burn
without being greasy
