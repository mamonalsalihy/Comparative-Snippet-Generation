the neutrogena one be somehow powdery and greasy at the same time
the screw on or flip top caps get a bit messy
it 's important to get a sun screen
it does n't leave a white residue
it 's more like a creamy goo
spf will honestly be a steal
there is almost no scent
it looks a little greasy
this is the exception
it 's not exactly
this is it
it 's 100spf
