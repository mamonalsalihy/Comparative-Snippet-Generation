this one also does n't leave a white cast
it does n't leave a white residue
the foundation will n't spread evenly or
the slight white cast disappears very quickly
likely because it is so occlusive
the sun heats the product itself
spf will honestly be a steal
it does n't show anymore
this is n't it
this is the exception
it be a mistake
it leaves no residue
this is it
it 's 100spf
