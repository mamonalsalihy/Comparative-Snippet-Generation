too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours
except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient
chemical sunscreen is n't biodegradable / ocean safe
also is n't 30 dollars a bottle
it is not greasy at all
thankfully this one does n't
only physical barrier sunscreen is
even after applying the spray
just base on the smell
nothing to write home about
there 's no avobenzone
there needs
