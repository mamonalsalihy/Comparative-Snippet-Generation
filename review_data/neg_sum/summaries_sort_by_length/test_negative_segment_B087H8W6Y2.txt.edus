a bit over - price , maybe a lot over - price
the lightweight formula does not lay on top of the skin
it requires very little rub in and leaves no white
it does n't leave a white layer
prepared to put it in several places
this does nt smell like sunscreen
than using smaller bottles and easy
there is no white cast
the complaints be always
without fussing with it
it be clear
