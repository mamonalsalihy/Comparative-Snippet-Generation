cons - weird to spread lol , like seriously just be prepare , this ai nt a normal ` ` cream ''
without holding onto a slippery bottle or dropping a cap etc
instead the label advertise state zinc oxcide and titanium dioxide
as recommend by dermatologists for those at risk for melanoma
this product definitely takes time
it does n't apply evenly
no where on the label
still rubbing it in
it 's job
