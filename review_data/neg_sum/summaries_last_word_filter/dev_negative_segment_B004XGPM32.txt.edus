maybe try applying on a small spot first . - has avobenzone for uva
there is very minimal skin to clothing transfer
it is nt greasy , or heavy
uva can still cause bad skin damage
this sunscreen is label as broad spectrum
it is suppose to be hypoallergenic
formaldehyde is link to cancer
it 's pretty hard
