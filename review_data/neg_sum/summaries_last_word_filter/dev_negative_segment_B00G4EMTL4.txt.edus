usually takes forever to slather on thick sun block creams
despite going into the ocean or swimming pools
just hang out with no sun burn
for opening and closing the wide pressing
once it 's about half go
as is the wind surfing
it gets hard to use
difficult to press spray
this be far simpler
no one get burn
