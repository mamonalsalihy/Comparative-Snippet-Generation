the spf 50 has a slight ` ` sun lotion '' smell
it does n't bother his eyes
it goes on thick and white
this prevent any sunburn from occuring
the price is a little crazy
the smell is not good either
dissolves quickly , dries clear
a favor and buy something
without feeling all slimy
it 's too bad
for driving in traffic
