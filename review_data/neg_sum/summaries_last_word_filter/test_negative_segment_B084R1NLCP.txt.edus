for some reason , this product contains an orange - color dye
not overwhelming at all and not the usual coconutty smell
the lotion is very light and feels dry
though is it not non - greasy completely
nice scent , but a bit overpowering
it come in a bigger bottle
it is nearly outdated product
most people do n't
this stuff is awful
as require by amazon
