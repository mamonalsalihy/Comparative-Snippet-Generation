tons of freckles and this stuff is mehh at best
just a handful of uses and it 's almost out
the only possible drawback is the beautiful fragrance
it will always be oily and sticky
the advertising for this product be misleading
almost feels like a edt deodorant
it 's a fake product
not thrill with this product
the smell is horrible
