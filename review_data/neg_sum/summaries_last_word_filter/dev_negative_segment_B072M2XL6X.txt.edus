a little goes a long way so be sure to use a little
the excessive washing and scrubbing is really not good for skin
without looking ghostly white and without clogging pores
it 's not label as sweat resistant
it does need to be reapply
it does n't feel heavy
this product is the truth
it goes on very sheer
since finding this product
it 's very lightweight
