it does n't smear or smudge anything
not worry about slick , greasy hands
it 's still annoying for something
others are n't test on animals
it is not too greasy
it 's not nearly enough
there is no oily mess
it 's reportedly dry finish
it 's not inexpensive
since starting this product
it does dries matte
