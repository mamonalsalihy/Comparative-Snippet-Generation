a common drug store brand has a stick more than twice the size
the applicator makes this more expensive than lotion in a bottle
it will n't leave a white cast
not even going to open the package
it be a huge let down
it also goes on very thick
it be out if stock though
unable to be use ,
it literally melts upon application
this product is terrible
it 's really disgusting
