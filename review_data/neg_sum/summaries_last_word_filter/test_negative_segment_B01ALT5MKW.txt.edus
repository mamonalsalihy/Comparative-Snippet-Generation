this sunscreen uses micro particles rather than nano particles of zinc oxide
it has a little bit of a white cast
until someone comes out with a completely clear option
there are no issues with sensitivity or iffy ingredients
sun protection can probably be a little better thou
it does nt say that on the directions
the sunscreen is not 100 % invisible
