the oils in this spray not only protect from the sun
not truly natural , imo , so choose base on occasion
it does n't say that on the directions
it is not clear / sheer ...
normally when buying a green sunscreen
whatever it gets on white
yes it 's a pain
this light spray covers thoroughly
no one have any issues
