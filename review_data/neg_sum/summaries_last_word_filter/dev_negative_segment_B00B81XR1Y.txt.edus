the price for two bottles here is only 1 more dollar than a single bottle in walgreens
like an abject lie to put     reef safe     on the label
people do nt wear it because of that but skin cancer yo
states like hawaii and many other countries have ban the use
no where on the bottle says its reef safe
this product is absolutely ineffective at preventing sunburns
the metal cans can get very hot
