too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours
except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient
also is n't 30 dollars a bottle
sticky feeling be n't an issue
the can even sprays upside down
thankfully this one does n't
shocked amazon allows this misrepresentation
avobenzene is not reef safe
