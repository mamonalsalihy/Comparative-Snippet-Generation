it goes on like moisturizer , does nt leave a white cast , smells faintly like coconut
it also does nt burn going on like the chemical stuff does after a while
hives prone skin have no reaction with this sunscreen
also , the tubes go a long way
it does nt blend in at all
it does make youe hands feel dry
