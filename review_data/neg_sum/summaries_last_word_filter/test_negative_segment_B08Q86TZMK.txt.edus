this does n't leave any white streaks or flashback
it literally does n't leave a white cast
it also does n't have a strong smell
it does give a dewey glow
there is no white cast
finally find a chemical sunscreen
it does n't feel oily
more importantly it dries clear
since that be one thing
there is no scent
as it dries down
