as being light and non greasy but unfortunately it fall short of its claims
as the spray does not seem to be alcohol - base
it does n't smell like the other brands
it is a different viscosity than the tube
the whole bottle is quite slippery
it leave a white gloopy mess
evenly absorb without white streaking
until it completely dry
well this is advertise
