as a florida girl there is simply no escaping the sun
it does nt have an overbearing scent like the sprays
it stays put , no dripping , no unprotected patches
the sunscreen resists sweat , heat , and water
vs picking it up at the local store
tho the difference is marginal at best so
those are not as effective as lotion
since it stays put
