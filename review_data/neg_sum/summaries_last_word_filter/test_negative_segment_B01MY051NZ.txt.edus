as it 's not super thick and gunky like other lotions
this then hit shoulders and face with zinc stick
its kinda hard to wait at the amusement park
-- think 120 - degree desert sun
it 's something about the scent
it does n't sting sensitive skin
the scent is n't very strong
it does need to be reapply
it do n't have the gross
this is the only sunscreen
barely touch the others
