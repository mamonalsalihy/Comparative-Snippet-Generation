ingredients in most suntan lotions can cause cancer
this is for serious sun - blocking
a thick application may stay white
since it 's a physical block
unless it 's rub in thoroughly
it is not greasy feeling
still can have allergic reactions
since it is mineral base
it is quite thick
it has no smell
this does n't spread
without wearing long sleeves
