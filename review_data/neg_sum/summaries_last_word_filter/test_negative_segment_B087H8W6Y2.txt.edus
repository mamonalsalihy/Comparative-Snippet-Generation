like it s releasing actual hellfire in the form of a painful , burning , sticky rash of irritated skin and teensy - weensy blisters
since the cost per ounce is cheaper than the smaller
there is no smell and absolutely no irritation from use
it be super sticky and icky on there too
also , the scent is little to none
