a bit over - price , maybe a lot over - price
the lightweight formula does not lay on top of the skin
it requires very little rub in and leaves no white
it does n't leave a white layer
prepared to put it in several places
this does nt smell like sunscreen
than using smaller bottles and easy
there is no white cast
the complaints be always
