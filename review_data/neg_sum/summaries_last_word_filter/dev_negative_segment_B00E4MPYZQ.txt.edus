the wrong spf and the spf 30 is a very greasy sunscreen
this goes on like a gel , dries quickly
it does n't fully absorb into the skin
all three bottles have a 6/20 expiration date
about returning the unused bottles in the order
great product . . never burn
it smells too much like alcohol
it 's non - greasy
the lotion clogs the pores
also does n't leave stains
