the past three or four bottles have a product design flaw so bad
2 bottles at different times and the color be different
whiteheads are nt hide very well by this product
this has nt bother it or cause any breakouts
it does nt streak or ever look orange
the tint / lotion seems runny and separate
shipping / arrival be a day late
perfectly without being the least bit orange
