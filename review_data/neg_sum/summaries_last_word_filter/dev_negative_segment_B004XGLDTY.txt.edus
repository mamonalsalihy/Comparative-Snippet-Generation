sprays tannin oil , browning oil , as well as the face sticks and lip sticks
most sun screens do not work very well
the only challenge be the hotel floor
this does n't irritate it at all
it is on the more expensive side
this is the only product
brand is n't reef safe
barely get a tan line
it be the worst
no one get burn
it do n't go
