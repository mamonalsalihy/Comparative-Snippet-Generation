it does n't have a strong smell or white cast
it does n't leave a white cast
it 's one of the only sunscreens
easy to apply with no white cast
even if it 's fragrance free
it 's ever so slightly stickier
it 's the only sunscreen
this product leaves no cast
about wearing sunscreen every day
it 's not something
