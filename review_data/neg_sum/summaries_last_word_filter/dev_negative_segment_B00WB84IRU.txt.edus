too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours
except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient
chemical sunscreen is n't biodegradable / ocean safe
also is n't 30 dollars a bottle
it is not greasy at all
thankfully this one does n't
even after applying the spray
just base on the smell
there 's no avobenzone
