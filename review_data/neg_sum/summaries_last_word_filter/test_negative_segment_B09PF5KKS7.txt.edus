it does n't cause a shine at all
it is n't make clear in the description
no , it is a pressurize spray bottle
the set of three is a bit excessive
the spray top has a safety lock
since it expires in a couple years

it 's not greasy or sticky
it eliminates accidental messes
by twisting the top
once it soak in
