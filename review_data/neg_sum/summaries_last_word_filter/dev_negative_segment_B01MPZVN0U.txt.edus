as it is a physical sunscreen as appose to a chemical one
it be one of the only physical sunscreens
it do leave a slightly oily sheen
since the sunscreen gives a white cast
most negative reviews are white caste
the shine also fades quickly
it 's the only cream
it be a gel formula
it does n't look
it is real thick
despite it being cloudy
