it is such a high spf with no white cast or irritation
despite being out in direct sun 8 + hours each time
for an effective sunscreen , this is nt super greasy
octinoxate may actually be a culprit for premature aging
it be like a white mask , absolutely terrible
it always goes on thick and white
usually it s the opposite with sunscreens
it s a bit greasy at first
