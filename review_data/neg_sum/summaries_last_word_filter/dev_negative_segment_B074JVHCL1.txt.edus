no white cast , no funky smell , absorbs quickly
the heat does n't get trap beneath the surface
mineral sunscreens leave a horrid white cast
it does n't interfere with makeup application
some folks may not need anything underneath
it leaves no white cast
without being oily or greasy
without it being sticky
it be still moist
it 's know stickiness
