it so far 3 times without any eczema flare
it is hard to squeeze out the bottle
it leaves a very noticeably white film
it is a very thick lotion
it be going to be thick
like this also magnify the sunburn
it 's thicker than anything
the bottle is n't bigger
there are no unpronounceable chemicals
also knead well before use
it 's so hard
