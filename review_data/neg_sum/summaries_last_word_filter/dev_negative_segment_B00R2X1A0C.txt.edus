not having spread the sunscreen all the way
it 's hard to find spf 15 anymore
other sunscreen can take forever to apply
the product does n't feel slimy either
people look down on spf 15 lotions
bottle arrive break on tuesday night
hard to find these days
as it nears summer time
this is the only sunscreen
only one application need
