not all of these products are honest about the ingredients in say product
other spray sunscreens are hard to press down one - handed sometimes
the price is steep on comparison to regular sunscreen
despite being in the sun every day
it taste like battery acid lol
it be less than 1/4 full
this is the only sunscreen
it does n't matter
once it be apply
