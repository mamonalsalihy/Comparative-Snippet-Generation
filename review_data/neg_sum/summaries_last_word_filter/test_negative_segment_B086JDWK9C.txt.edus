no white cast , moisturizing , lightweight , great under makeup
it also does not leave a heavy white cast after application
this is a serious reaction , not a mild irritation
still leaves a gray / white cast on darker skin
it also does nt have that weird zinc smell
3     it does nt feel any heavier
