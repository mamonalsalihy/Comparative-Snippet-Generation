it also does not leave a heavy white cast after application
this is a serious reaction , not a mild irritation
it also does n't have that weird zinc smell
3 . it does n't feel any heavier
since it 's a physical sunscreen
it does n't leave a cast
it is very painful and concerning
this is the only face sunscreen
this product is not sticky
this product is expensive
