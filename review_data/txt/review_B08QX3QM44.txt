This product states that it is a clear sunscreen. It is definitely NOT clear. It coats the skin with a white layer that does not go away. Unfortunately, I did not using it when I first received it. When I did try to use it and discovered that it was not acceptable, it was too late for me to return it. I use other Babo sunscreens and am so disappointed that this one is not anything that I can use.

You still have to rub this in a bit, but it has great sun protection and no bad smell. Ingredients are great, and I feel safe putting it on my kids. It absorbs well without much of a white cast at all. Way easier than dealing with bottle-sunscreen. If you are having trouble with mineral-based sunscreen absorption, the culprit is usually dry/dehydrated skin that hasn’t been well exfoliated. This stuff soaks in for us great

I wish this came with a protective cap cover as I recently purchase a new batch and one canister completely emptied out in my bag. Somehow it unlocked and ruined my bag and wasted my money. This is the 1st time I’ve had this happen however now I put a cap on the others I have to prevent it from happening again (I hope). Overall this is a great product. It doesn’t leave you oily or shinny and you really do not need to reapply unless you sweat profusely. Another con though is it is hard to spread. I find rubbing it on in small sections (first applying to your hand) makes it easier to rub in. Do rub it in quickly or it’ll leave your skin white from the product.

I was the only person who didn’t get sunburned in Mexico while on vacation.  This sunscreen works great but definitely stays on well even through a shower or swim. It definitely comes out thick and comes out white. I would recommend it if you’re okay with a whiteish tint.

It is the second bottle that I buy because I really liked how easy it is to apply and that it protects me well

Best sun protection and easy to use. My husband has a very sensitive skin and for first time from long time, he enjoys the time at the beach. For first time we do not get any sunburn, ever the temperature was so high.

It is not sheer but the spray is easier than a bottle

No scent. Not greasy.easy to use under makeup

I love the Babo sunscreen for my kiddos. When I saw the spray was on sale I jumped on it because we’d only been using the tube sunscreen. I figured this would be quicker but it certainly is not. The nozzle is so messy and it doesn’t spray where you want it to. It sprays in a literal circle, so if it’s pointed at your kids neck, it will spray all around their hair and back. When I bathe my kids after using this, the sunscreen stays in their hair. It is so tough to get it all the way out. And I really have to scrub their bodies with a rag to get the sunscreen off. Does it protect from the sun? Yes, this is the best sunscreen brand. But the spray can isn’t the move, definitely spring for the Babo tubed sun screen.

The spray on this sunscreen is NOT a mist. It’s thick and essentially is a rub in cream sunscreen. The spray is also very weird. It sprays a circle and the inside of the circle gets no product. Overall very weird application but it’s not greasy, is great sun protection, and is reef safe. I would recommend overall.

good for children not so much for adults

I have yet to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave that ghostlike sheen, but this one is probably the best in that area, just a slight pale residue of whiteness. With that said, I don’t need to use a lot of it at one time, just a thin layer and it has worked super well to prevent sunburns for my sun sensitive skin.

I used this sparingly on my granddaughter and myself. Between us, we managed to get white all over her stroller and my car door. Wouldn't come off the car, even after going through a car wash. This is NOT clear and left our skin with a white, ghostly film.

eos-eos

I wanted to love this product but sadly, we did not. We applied and rubbed it in as best we could and waited before sun exposure. If you have dark-colored swimwear it's gonna leave white all over. We tried putting it on prior to the swimwear but much like how deodorant leaves white on clothes, this does the same. We reapplied and yet all ended up red. This also leaves your skin incredibly white and just doesn't feel good. Couldn't wait to get home and wash it off.

eos-eos

Works but holy crap is it thick!! o_O Seems no matter how long you rub, you're still gonna be painted white, lol!

eos-eos

I sprayed my kids on our deck when they went to play outside last month, despite heavy rain, you can still see exactly where I sprayed them. Also requires a lot of rubbing in for a spray, would have been better off with a lotion or a clearer spray, then my deck might be ok...

eos-eos

I want to love this product because of the non oxybenzene and other harmful ingredients in most sunscreens. However the problem is finding one that applies sheer. no matter how many different ways I applied this on myself and family members, it still came out pasty and hard to rub in. It definitely left a white film that would dissipate in a half hour! Also the kids did not like the smell, and it left a residue on your hands like paste, so if you touch your hair it would stick. Would not buy again.

I use this on my 6-year old. It does spray on like white mist and I end up rubbing it in but I like that its not heavy on chemicals so its worth it.

eos-eos

This sunscreen comes out very thick and leaves a fairly thick layer of white film. It’s easy enough to spread on, but is not much of a benefit as a spray over a cream. Bought this to be a quick touch up on the go, but it can’t really be used that way since it coats clothes and swim suits and requires rubbing it all in and some time to go clear.

eos-eos

Yes all zinc sunscreens are white, but this is like spray snow! It stained multiple swimsuits and hats. It does spray well and works well! But be warned it is VERY white!

eos-eos

Smells good and lasts quite a while but I can’t seem to rub it in enough that the white cast disappears.

eos-eos

It’s a powerful spray. Good sun protection but it sort of gets everywhere. You have to put on before getting dressed to prevent getting it on your clothes.

eos-eos

Not sheer at all and even after lots of rubbing in you will look like a white ghost. Yes, it does protect you from the sun but it gets all over everything and unless you're wearing all white, will smear on your clothes, car, towels, etc. It feels like you have a layer of film all over you that is not pleasant. I threw this away after one use because it's not worth the hassle or all of the weird looks I got from people at the beach as an iridescent white version of myself that more closely resembled a Twilight vampire when they go out in the sun. Not a look I recommend!

eos-eos

Works well but leaves a white appearance on darker skin.

eos-eos

Does NOT blend at all on tan skin .. PLUS NOT returnable .. I’ve used this before from another source .. I added lotion to Help blend ewwwwww Cannot use and out the $$$

eos-eos

White sunscreen… smells nice, goes on evenly, did protect skin but also gave that white/opaque sheen. POCs I don’t recommend.

eos-eos

Sun protections seems great but the consistency is weird. I’ve used comparable products that spread more easily.

eos-eos

This doesn’t go on sheer at all and is a bit messy to spray. I had to spray it in my hands then apply it, which defeats the purpose of getting this bottle.

eos-eos

This product was very hard to rub in. And even after rubbing it in as much as I could, it was still not sheer. Sun protection didn’t seem to work. I was trying to buy a non-toxic, sheer, reef safe sunscreen and this missed the mark for me and wasn’t inexpensive either. Returning the other bottle I bought.

eos-eos

It’s good protection but when you spray it’s a little thick and white. When you try to rub it in you can still see the white lotion. I don’t like to be that person that looks of too much sunscreen.

eos-eos

This sprays on white and you have to rub it in. I spent a ridiculous amount of money on this product which was supposed to be clear but it’s a lie. I shook it before use but it didn’t make any difference. This stuff stains shoes, clothing and furniture white and is basically like glue. I do not recommend this!

eos-eos

I gave it 2 stars because tthe wording Sheer is misleading. This stuff sprays on white!

eos-eos

It works, but is no more "sheer" than their regular mineral sunscreen. I'm not sure if it is just my bottle, but it also sprayed out weird. Not an even spray but circular with nothing spraying out in the middle. Wont buy again.

This product advertises as being sheer. It is anything but sheer. I am a very pale red head and it even made me look ghostly white!! I purchased 4 cans of the SPF 50 and several of the SPF 30 for my beach trip and when I got there and my partner and I used either it was terrible. Left white residue on our skin and on our swim suits that did not go away until we showered and washed our suits. Now that I am back in town and have tried to return the items I am notified that I am unable to due to too long of time since purchase. I purchased this item about 2 weeks ago. Very displeased.

eos-eos

1st- not at all sheer. Just as white as previous bottle of babo botanicals. I like the company/sun protection and it seemed like this was a newer version that applied sheer- that was not the case. 2nd- the spray nozzle broke after the 2nd use.

eos-eos

It’s not easy to spread, I recommend spraying it in your hand prior to application. Leaves a purple tint, isn't sheer at all, but it’s practically scentless.

eos-eos

NOT SHEER! Totally opaque like white spray paint. Ruins clothes and sticks to your skin for days! Awful!

eos-eos

The good news is, it doesn't upset my daughter's eczema, but there are other cheaper also white sunscreens that also don't do that.

eos-eos

Not a white cast that disappears but this is literally a white spray. Doesn’t blend well on brown skin at all.

eos-eos

This is not a SHEER product. My son is a lifeguard, he sprayed it on and it would not spread or rub in. The overspray was all over the pool deck and had to be SCRUBBED off because it was so slippery. I will never buy this product again and wish I could get my money back! So disappointed.

eos-eos

This product is very hard to blend in and leaves a white cast. Nothing sheer about it.

eos-eos

Not sheer. What the heck? Pure white spray. Does not spread easily.

eos-eos

Goes on white... have to rub in

eos-eos

I bought this hoping to spray over my make up to reapply SPF but it sprays out really uneven, it’s super thick and you have to rub it in a lot, it stays looking really white and chalky and has a very odd smell to it. I am unable to return it so I’m keeping it to use on my body but even after rubbing it in you still see it looking very white on the skin

eos-eos

This product isn’t sheer. It’s white and pasty. Doesn’t rub In. And then when you try to return it, this company doesn’t allow returns. Ill be contacting Amazon because that’s false advertising. This item is too expensive to not get what you paid for.

eos-eos

Not easily spreadable. Leaves thick white layer. Bought thinking I should get better sunscreen for kiddos, kids end up looking like Casper.

eos-eos

Didn’t worth the money !!!

Love the brand babo. The lotion spreads so nicely not leaving you looking so white from the zinc but this spray is thick and does not spread well. Leaves your skin looking white not matter how much you try to rub it in.

I LOVE BABO BOTANICALS!!! I’ve used both their cream & stick sunscreens before, but sometimes those are too thick and hard to spread evenly (especially on a squirmy toddler). This spray does contain zinc, so it still leaves a cast of white on their skin, but is much easier to massage in. This one is fragrance-free and perfect for babies (6M+) that have sensitive skin. It’s also perfect for toddlers, older kids, and even adults. My son and I both wore it while in hot sun for a few hours. I made sure to re-apply it every hour or so, and we both did great and didn’t burn! He was also in and out of water the entire time.  It’s a fairly large can and should last awhile. Yes, it’s expensive... but it’s made with high quality ingredients and is super gentle. My son’s skin felt SOOOOO SOFT after using it!  *TIPS: Spray this on your hands first for younger babies and toddlers. It won’t be as cold, and won’t surprise them. Plus, you don’t have to worry about fumes or product getting into their airways. When we’re out and about, I carry a beauty blender in my bag for touch ups. It’s easier to reach tiny areas (like behind his ears) and my hands stay clean! 😉  I highly recommend it (and everything else this brand makes!).  EDITED TO ADD: I just wanted to stress the fact that this is completely fragrance-free. It doesn’t smell like sunscreen, but also doesn’t have any sort of herbal/natural scent. I’ve tried many other mineral sunscreens that claim to be fragrance-free but have some sort of smell… And this does not.  Hope this helps. ☀️

great ingredients but not worth it to look like a fool
