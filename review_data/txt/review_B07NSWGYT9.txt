I like this sunscreen. My initial purchase was under $15 on sale which is a reasonable price for more natural sunscreen. I did not have any reaction to it after using on my face, hands, neck, ears and chest. I do have sensitive skin and breakout and get itchy but I'm not sure which chemicals cause that outside of heavy added fragrance. It is mid-weight to lightweight for 45spf and was easy to rub in. I haven't tested it by being in direct sunlight for long periods, maybe up to 75 minutes at max. I didn't notice a white residue though I do rub in with oil serums to help rub into skin. I like it and will buy again assuming the pricing is still reasonable.

Love it! Provides great coverage and moisturizes my face and does not leave it white like other high spf sunblocks. Very good for my sensitive skin.

I like it, doesn‚Äôt stink and works great. It is sheer, but it is greasy, so if you were hoping to wear this under makeup, I suggest you buy something else.

Great sunscreen for face that doesn‚Äôt leave you looking ghostly white. I live in Florida so sunscreen is a daily must. I‚Äôve tried so many sunscreens over the years and this one is my new favorite. It‚Äôs so nice to find a product that actually does what it claims.

This is very light with great sun protection. Applies nicely on the face. Doesn't run into my eyes. No real scent to speak of. I don't breakout with this on my face or neck.

Once I figured out how to dispense the sunblock from the tubeü§ìüòñü§£‚Ä¶I was delighted that the right amount is always dispensed.

Love it! Creamy and spreadable. Not sticky at all.

This is the only sunscreen I‚Äôve tried that doesn‚Äôt irritate my son‚Äôs skin.

I love this facial sunscreen. I wear it under my daily moisturizer and it is not to greasy. It has never made my skin break out. I‚Äôm nervous they are going to stop making this product so I buy multiple at a time.

Was looking for a good sunscreen for my face. Was very pleased with this product.

Applied this liberally once and sat in the sun fun hours. Did not get burned and did not clog my pores

What I expected

eos-eos

First, the good parts... It spreads easily and the texture feels good on my skin. But that's where my satisfaction with this product ends. I can't comment on its efficacy because I wore it only three times for about 30 min in cloudy conditions. I couldn't wait to wash it off because it's not fragrance free. It's perfumed and not in a natural way. Also, I've never had a product "bleed" like this into my eyes and mouth. I made sure to stop application about 1/4 inch away from my eyes and mouth, but within 20 min, it had traveled. My eyes remained irritated for the rest of the day and I couldn't stop tasting the stuff. I need my sunscreen and make-up to stay put. And honestly, "fragrance-free" products shouldn't include perfumed ingredients. I hate wasting product, but I'll be throwing out this nearly-new bottle. It's unusable. I think I'll go back to Suntegrity.

I use different Sunscreen, but this its the best, clear not white residue.

Have been using this sunscreen for a long time now! Haven't been disappointed yet!

Te puedes maquillar, f√°cil de aplicar. Su dispositivo muy bueno. Y no contiene olor que me produzcan alergia.

I use Alba on my face for sun protection and love it. It goes on very easy. I would highly recommend it.

Worked great

Gets in your eyes and burns like hell. Not sure how damaging this is to my eyes, but just as dangerous is the fact that it might lead some people to not put sunscreen near their eyes, exposing the most delicate skin on their face to UV radiation. Also, not sure why a fragrance free product has lavender extract. I wonder if this might be one of the irritants.  I will say that I find the product to has a rich moisturizing feel, which I like in a sunscreen, and it's reasonably priced. This is the second sunscreen I've gotten from this brand that's been a total fail for me, though, so obviously I'll be avoiding them in the future.

The product arrived in a tube without any safety seal. The pump top did not have a seal over the tube opening nor it the clear pump cap have a plastic seal. This seems odd considering the normal product packaging procedures.

eos-eos

This facial sunscreen smooths on quickly and becomes invisible. Does not run in your eyes during sports. Clever little pumper spout that dispenses just the right pearl-size amount for each side of the face.

eos-eos

I am relieved to find a product that doesn't break me out so I bought 4 of them. On the downside, it shines, runs into my eyes, and the applicator clogs so you have to unscrew it to use it. I wear a hat anyway but have not gotten darker in the pool.

eos-eos

I like that it does not leave my face white, but don‚Äôt feel it does much more. It also feels like it melts during sun.

On my quest for a holy grail sunscreen, this one had a nice texture and did not cause me to breakout which almost worried me when buying this. It broke one of my cardinal facial sunscreen sins though by burning my eyes. While I know I should just avoid the eye area, I find no point in a having a separate sunscreen for face if I can‚Äôt also put it on my eyelids and under eye area. I have oily eyelids so this is a problem I encounter frequently with certain sunscreens, so I just ended up gifting this to somebody who doesn‚Äôt normally have the same problem.

eos-eos

Good sun protection, I have very sensitive skin so it's hard to find a good sunscreen that doesn't make my skin break out in a rash. This is scent free, I had no rash, my only complaint is that it leaves my face feeling greasy all day

eos-eos

You know a product is good when you stock it up. This sunscreen is really affordable, reef friendly, cruelty free and leaves no white shield! Would recommend if you're looking for a new sunscreen, but beware, as it is kinda oily.

eos-eos

If you even THINK you might sweat, this stuff will run into your eyes and burn. It's a painful, "Should I just go ahead and pull my eyeball out?" sort of burn. That being said, my skin didn't fry in the Caribbean sun so it's got that going for it.

eos-eos

I liked the idea of this sunscreen, but after trying multiple times to wear it with minimal sweat and short periods of time (about an hour, two tops) and getting burnt, I am over it. Also, the way you dispenses was kind of annoying. I was just disappointed all around.

eos-eos

I got this sunscreen bc it was supposed to be a better alternative to the ones with potentially dangerous ingredients. I wanted this to work but it didn't, the burning of the eyes is enough to not make wana wear it. Its horrible being out and suddenly your eyes are stinging and crying. On top of that its pretty greasy which I didnt mind but now I'm just miffed.

eos-eos

Believe me and the other reviewers who said this product burns your eyes. Even without going to the water, even long after the product is supposed to have being absorbed.

I really wanted to like it, but it burns my eyes so badly. My eyes were stinging for hours even after I washed and wiped it away from my eyes. I wasn‚Äôt even sweating so I‚Äôm not sure how it got into my eyes.

It says fragrance free yet it smells so strongly my entire family was sick and had headaches

Product was not sealed It seems to have less amount of product than the one I get from the store!

For a facial sunscreen, this just did not cut it. Burns your eyes no matter how careful you are to not get it anywhere near them

child BLISTERED in sun with this product-doesn't work at all, in fact probably made it worse. Will stick with the tried & true products (coppertone etc)

Sweats into my eyes and really hurts.

Very thick and greasy. It also did not work well. I reapplied twice in an 8 hour day and was burned.

Didn‚Äôt think it was really gonna be an issue since I‚Äôm very careful not to apply near my eyes. I was sooooo wrong!

Es un protector solar que deja la piel de la cara brillante, no tiene control de grasa, ademas me tiene irritados los ojos y eso que aun no lo he usado para hacer deporte, no me gusto

eos-eos

It does not irritate my skin. Went to the beach last weekend and didn‚Äôt get sunburned. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it a 4 start is because it makes my face greasy right away. I do have greasy/ combination skin. I just use setting clear powder on top and it does the trick and I don‚Äôt get greasy again throughout the day. I have not tried the sunscreen with make up.

I've been struggling to find a daily sunscreen for a while since they all seemed to leave a white cast even on my pale skin, smell too strongly, or cause me to break out and/or dry out. I've been using this one for a few days now and I haven't had any of those issues at all. It's a chemical sunscreen, so no white cast, but is still environmentally friendly. No scent besides that of the sunscreen itself, and even that is relatively unnoticeable. Doesn't seem overly drying or oily, though it'll take a bit more time to see if it leads to trouble with acne. My only complaint is that it's not super easy to spread so you do have to use a little bit more (a dab on each cheek and one on my forehead seems to be working). For the price, I'm definitely happy.

eos-eos

Like most, I hate the way sunscreen feels on, the scent of it and also the chemicals.  I‚Äôve always loved Alba‚Äôs products but this facial sunscreen is seriously AMAZING! It‚Äôs extremely light weight, no scent at all. I wouldn‚Äôt know I was wearing sunscreen if I hadn‚Äôt been the one applying it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôm fair skinned and freckled with somewhat sensitive skin and I‚Äôve never had an issue with any of Alba Botanical products. Hope this works for you also.

eos-eos

This is definitely not lightweight IMO, but nevertheless it is sheer and non-greasy. There is no added fragrance, but it does have a sunscreen smell which I personally don‚Äôt mind. No irritation at all and I feel like I‚Äôm covered. Not sure how this would wear under makeup so I will be reserving for recreational use like my afternoon walk! Would buy again though it‚Äôs not my first choice.  UPDATE: Way too thick, hard to wash off, turns greasy and has lavender in it which is a big skin care no-no. Wish I had seen before I purchased. Cannot return now.

I have rosacea so sun protection on my face is key. Finding one that has better ingredients is challenging, as well as, finding one that doesn't cause a flare up is hard. This product works great for me and actually calms my rosacea symptoms a bit. It's lightweight and not greasy. I'd recommend it highly.

My daughter had an almost instant allergic reaction to this. I used it only on her face (she‚Äôs 10) and she got a massive rash within minutes. I had her wash it off right away and used hydrocortisone cream to try to soothe it.

Same product as in the website but it says unscented1 So not true! It has a very strong flowery scent! Had to return this one. Don't buy this if you want an unscented sunscreen! Inaccurate website description!

Good sunscreen but burns your eyes even if you avoid putting it on the eyelids or around the eye.
