I can't express how much I love this sunscreen. I loved ThinkBaby and everything about it. This one's EVEN BETTER! It doesn't smell as strongly of the pleasant orange smell ThinkBaby has, plus because it's "sport" my growing child feels more growed up than with the ThinkBaby, so it gets used more often, which is essential to the effectiveness of the product. :o) Anyway, some folks don't like that tanning occurs. I don't mind that as long as the harmful rays aren't getting through. Plus it stays on SOOO much better in water! I don't mind the white, either... that way I can see where it is and where it may need to be applied, or applied again. Reapplication is key with any sunscreen, so we reapply on beach and pool days... a lot. But it doesn't matter if skin is wet or not, we're still protected. Oh, and this is one of the ONLY natural sunscreens I've researched that actually IS natural! There are no chemical sunscreens, even in a supplemental manner like some of the others that claim to be natural (BabyGanics, Blue Lizard). Very happy with this very healthy sunscreen. Thank you SOOO much!

I’m a plastic/reconstruction nurse & specialize in skincare. I’ve used Thinksport on my son who is now 5 for over 2 summers now. He is protected from UVB & UVA rays. This past summer we were at the beach for several hours in & out of the water, on our boat & jet ski & through reapplication mainly on his face that he would wipe a lot, he got very little pinkness. I use this on the back of my hands & it works great preventing hyperpigmentation & I’m a Scottish freckler.

Great score on EWG's sunscreen list and a great product for my kids. To be fair, my kids all get random rashes for who knows what reason. The wind? The alignment of the planets? It's a mystery. But two of my kids get firey hot, red contact rash from spray sunscreens (neutrogena kids and banana boat). The other kid gets the same from aveeno and neutrogena creams. What a disaster. So I read through the EWG's sunscreen list and ordered a few brands to try last summer. Although initially I loved Badger's tangerine (or maybe it's orange) vanilla sunscreen the best and ended up ordering more of that one, I was over the sweet smell by the time Fall rolled around. So when Spring came, I ordered this one and I'm just as satisfied with it as the kids specific line I had ordered previously. Nobody has been sunburned and nobody has a rash. I look forward to a long relationship with this brand.

This is the third product I have tried that is rated a "1" on EWG's safe sunscreen list and it is by far my favorite. I purchased this for my fair skinned son who has swim team practice daily in mid-day sun AND uses acne meds that increase his chance of burning. Three reasons to worry about his skin! He doesn't have the slightest pink cast to his skin after an hour in the pool. I use physical sunscreens like this on my face daily to keep melasma and freckles from darkening, not to mention I've had four spots biopsied that were pre-melanoma despite being so sun-conscious for the last 25 years (the melasma and freckles popped up when I was foolishly relying on chemical sunscreens). So I tried it myself and loved it. It goes on like moisturizer, doesn't leave a white cast, smells faintly like coconut (delicious!), and works well under mineral foundation. I'll be buying this brand for myself too and I'd recommend it to anyone. Excellent, water resistant protection worth the money.

i got this for my husband and thought if it's ok for kids skin then it would be ok for him and he really likes it. He tells me that while the whitish hue is there, it's not bad and he is a serial re-apply guy (he keeps it in his pocket and puts it on every few minutes- makes me nuts) but he says he doesn't need to nearly as often. I use the adult kind in the red/black/white tube and I'm very happy w it too.

With three fair skinned people in my family, we go through sunscreen like water in the summer! Last year I went on a quest to find out what is actually IN sunscreen and was amazed at how unsafe chemical sunscreen is! Chemicals in it actually seep into your bloodstream, which prompted me to switch my family to mineral sunscreens. I consulted the EWG database for sunscreens and bought a few of their best rated sunscreens, including ThinkBaby & ThinkSport. All of the top rated sunscreens are incredibly expensive compared to chemical sunscreens, but my family's health comes first so I ponied up.  ThinkSport has been my favorite so far. It's a mineral sunscreen that is thick compared to chemical sunscreens, but still thin enough to spread easily. We've had no burns yet with ThinkSport, and we have used it for long days in the pool, reapplying every hour and a half. By comparison, I found ThinkBABY way too thick, messy, and hard to spread. Also, using ThinkBABY my daughter did end up burnt for the first time in her life... twice.  We'll stick to ThinkSport unless and until we find a cheaper, but still high quality, alternative.

I have used this exact sunscreen for three years now. I LOVE it. It is rated great for health, and the water resistance on this is great. Even if my kids are wearing goggles, if we rubbed it in well, about 10-15 minutes before they put them on - no problem. When we go to the beach for the day, I usually reapply once and they are fine. Although it goes on thick at first, you will find it will eventually blend in. Sometimes I am a little heavy-handed and you can get the "ghost" effect - but I don't care. My kids' skin is safe and I am not dealing with application battles over and over as it wears off in the water. It is well-worth the cost, and Amazon seems to have the best price. My local Target is $2 more. We also use this in the winter when we are skiing or ice fishing on the lake.

My son has eczema and incredibly sensitive skin, and is also pasty white like his daddy, so we started using the baby version of this when he was little, and switched to the sport version around the toddlerhood. We have never had any issues with him either getting sunburned or it irritating his skin, and in fact we ended up using a “all natural” mineral sunscreen at my mom’s house and my poor bud had a huge reaction and had a bout of eczema that took weeks to resolve. I’ll be buying a bottle of this to keep it at her house from now on, and we won’t be switching up again any time soon!

We really love this stuff, both for our 15 month-old and ourselves.  I've been doing the "natural" sunscreen thing for years. YEARS. I'll tell you why this one is outstanding (in no particular order): 1. It doesn't smell bad. Quite good, actually. 2. Rubs in nicely with good coverage. 3. Good ingredients. Our dermatologist friend switched to using this after checking out one of our tubes. 5. Good value. 6. Doesn't burn as bad if you get it in your eyes accidentally--this is obviously huge with kids.  I know some people have had bad reactions to this. I can only say that I've had the bumpy rash thing happen with some sunscreens in the past, and that it's just an uncommon sensitivity people have to ingredients sometimes.  One final note: Be mindful of the reapplication guidelines. If you fudge those at all, you're going to get burnt with this or any sunscreen.

eos-eos

This is my favorite of the mineral sunscreens I have tried. It has a pleasant scent, is effective at sun protection and very easy to blend in. It also doesn't bother my kids who have eczema and very sensitive skin. I have tried several of the mineral sunscreens and most are either difficult to rub in due to being either too oily or too thick, don't work very well or bother my kid's eczema, but this one is perfect and the one I will be purchasing the future.

eos-eos

I love this product as it has 20% Zinc Oxide, so that's some serious SPF. Also, it's safe for kids and sea creatures, so that means it's good for this adult and the planet. I love it. It is thick and goes on slightly white for about 10 seconds, but disappears. It's great for daily use on your face, but I do mix it with the thinner and different active ingredients of Elta MD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF46, which is a winning combo. I use this straight up on my hands and you CAN use it on your face, it's semi-thick but it's what I put on first every day before makeup and it's great for work or the beach.

I have been searching for a mineral sunscreen that is safe for my family and while there are many brands out there that are safe with no harmful chemicals they all seems to make a mess when you put them on. They are thick and hard to rub in and leave a white film on the skin and seem to stain anything they touch. Trust me, we have tried A LOT of brands and have a lot of full bottles of sunscreen around the house. I started to think we were just going to need to accept it if we wanted to use a non toxic sunscreen. Well, that is not the case! This sunscreen is the one...scores very well on the EWG scale for safety AND it actually rubs in and didn't leave the skin white and gross. Not too thick and the scent is great. Highly recommend!!! Approved by the whole family!

No issues after a week of solid use in the scorching Texas sun. My son has light and sensitive skin and sometimes suffers from eczema. No sunburns and no reactions. I used my brain a bit and put a little bit on him in one spot to make sure he would not have a reaction. It works well on me too. This sunscreen applies well and smells really good too. I recently found out about EWG's standards and was appalled (but not surprised) that many sunblock products have potentially harmful chemicals in them. So, that lead me to purchase this product.

eos-eos

We used this all summer and it worked great on my three kids (one infant) and both my husband and myself. No burns at all. It is super thick going on, so remember a little can go a long way. My husband seemed to have trouble getting it completely rubbed in around his facial hair, but other than looking a bit "pale" this didn't seem to affect the performance of the product. I love the scent- it smells fresh with a hint of citrus. We ended up purchasing about one tube per month, but since we only need this about three months out of the year the extra expense seemed totally worth it to know I wasn't covering my family in chemicals! I am pretty sure all the formulas are about the same (baby, sport, regular) so we just bought whichever one was the cheapest each time we ordered. They all worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this. Also-- I am quite pale as are my children so don't shy away just because you have fair skin or burn easily. This product can do it!

I have been using thethinksport SPF 50 Plus Sunscreen, 3 Ounce (Packaging May Vary) for a couple months now and I absolutely love it. I thought I would give the "kids" version a try to see if I liked it any better/less than the original, as it was about $1 less. Overall, I like it just as well as the original sunscreen. Apparently, this is exactly the same as the original just with a different smell. I don't mind the smell. It's not fabulous, but not bad. Just okay.  As you can see in the pictures, this sunblock goes on well for a zinc based physical sunblock. Sometimes, these types of sunblocks leave a while film, I have not had that trouble. You have to rub it it well, but it's not overly difficult. I have no trouble getting the white color to fade on myself. On my squirmy daughter I sometimes notice a white cast to her skin in spots, but nothing too bad.  The first photo shows that I put a healthy amount of the sunblock on my hand. It's important to apply a liberal amount of sunblock to get the full SPF protection, this is true of all sunblocks. The second picture shows what it looked like after a couple wipes. The third picture shows what it looks like completely rubbed in. I had quite a bit so I had to work it into my wrist and forearm a bit. As you can see, I put a large amount on and I still didn't end up with a white color to my skin. Perhaps, if I had darker skin it would be more of an issue.  I find that liquid sunblocks work much better than the aerosol kind, this brand is my favorite.

eos-eos

I've been using this product for almost a year now (maybe more) - mainly for my face and any other body parts exposed to the sun during the day - and love it; I've had no issue with allergic reactions, skin rashes, or bad acne breakouts (all of which I am sensitive to) with this product. This has been my favorite zinc oxide sunscreen so far as it's been the easiest to apply and rub in versus some other brands. The only downside, as with any physical sunscreen like this one, is that it can leave a white film/residue over the skin that you need to take the time to distribute evenly. Other than that, stellar product!

eos-eos

This sunscreen is the only one I will use on the kids other than Thinkbaby. I have used it on two kids for two summers and they have never had a sunscreen. I on the other hand have used various other major brands on myself and still had some burns on myself. I think Thinksport just does a better job.  I wish they made a tinted one for me to use on my face. It definitely leaves a white haze that I didn't notice until I tried it on my face. I never noticed it on the kids. On them it seems to fade and I definitely don't mind it because they're just kids.

eos-eos

I have very sensitive skin, and have developed an allergy to a preservative in the last few years. The ingredients in this product are very clean! I have been using this sunscreen for 3 years now on my kids, myself, and my husband. Absolutely no burns after week long trips to the beach with ocean and pool activities. We all have some dry skin after the week, but that happens with any type of sunscreen we’ve used in the past.

Think sport kids spf50, easy to apply, you need to rub in really well so that you will not look white ( we are tan filipinos) . It doesn't leave you feeling greasy or sticky, it does make youe hands feel dry if you don't wash them off. Compared to the thinksport baby stick spf 30 which leaves a little whiteness. We have tried a Pacifica brand face sunscreen and it doesn't blend in at all leaving you white. This is the second brand mineral sunscreen we have tried and will continue to use. I know it is very hard to find one that doesn't leave you white!

eos-eos

This stuff works! When applied to your face it stays put, it doesn't float into your eyes and it fully protects. It has a pleasant smell that isn't harsh at all, and washes off completely with gentle soap and water at the end of the day. Some kids sunscreen is tenacious to remove and does an inadequate job of protecting. Not this, this is the little bottle that can. I use it on the whole family with no burns. I love it!

eos-eos

A staple for now 5 years in our home. Thinksport and Thinkbaby are our go to sunscreens. Lots of great reviews here. Just want to add that my children with ultra sensitive, hives prone skin have no reaction with this sunscreen. We have now converted our entire family to this brand. Best sun protection and EWG approved. Thank you

eos-eos

I applied every 2 hrs all day long and I still burned. It also gave me a rash. I don’t know why but most natural sunscreens cause a reaction where chemical ones do not.

eos-eos

my red-headed son and I both have really sensitive skin and eyes. This sunscreen doesn't burn our skin or eyes and it holds up really well even after hours of surfing for both of us. It also rubs in pretty well compared to some other natural sunscreens. It smells amazing and it feels good too. I love that it has ingredients that I am comfortable with.

eos-eos

I like this sunscreen. It does leave a slight whitish hue- but the trade off is a sunscreen that stays and even more important for my allergy laden, uber-sensitive and ultra white red-head- it doesn't burn her skin or run into her eyes and burn. So far- its the only sunscreen I can get her to put on her face without complaint. Oh- there's still complaint- now its about HAVING to put it on!  With that being said, I hate to complain, but it does add up in price. It doesn't go as far as you might hope for the price. So I limit who can use it- no one else!

eos-eos

A little hard to rub in, but better than the other mineral sunblocks I have tried. This one is my favorite, but since it is more expensive than some I have been using it just on my face. I haven't gotten burnt yet in Cabo! I am very pale and burn easily, so I am loving how well this product works. It also doesn't burn going on like the chemical stuff does after a while when you're on vacation in a sunny location. This specifically happens to me on my face, because my skin is really sensitive, so this is a win. The smell is light and unobtrusive.

eos-eos

It's a very very good sunscreen. Very effective, safe and good coverage. The best sunscreen I've bought for my entire family. Lasts the longest and works the best and has the best rating in terms of safety. Bought the ThinkBaby one for my kids initially but my husband liked it so much that he makes me buy it for him and he really uses it all the time. So I actually have it on subscription because it saves a little money and we use it that often anyways, The smell is good too. Not all chemically like all those other sunscreens.

eos-eos

Not sticky, good scent, but just wished that the tube lasted longer.  You will definitely need to rub this in good to prevent looking all powder white, but it is worth it for the sun protection. I love that there is no sticky sensation afterwards and it can also be applied to your face.  After only 4 uses, I feel like I'm going through it so quickly. I think because it doesn't spread easily, I end up using more than "regular" sunblock, and for the price, I wish there was more in the tube.

eos-eos

Love this stuff. We have spent tons of money trying to find a sunscreen that will work for my kiddo with extremely sensitive skin. Literally tried 15+ sunscreens recommended by pediatrician and all of them irritated his skin. This one is AMAZING. With every cent.

eos-eos

This product is safe for you to use, it absorbs easily, and the kids version of Thinksport smells really nice. The scent is why I ordered the kids stuff instead of the regular. If I'm going to want to use a sunscreen every day (and let's face it, it's one of those things we all know we SHOULD do, but it's kinda hard to remember, esp. in the winter) I want it to be smell nice - that makes it attractive to me and makes me want to use it. Once this tube is used up, I will most definitely be ordering it again. Can't beat it for the price.

eos-eos

We read a lot of reviews before ordering this. Blue Lizard is ok for arms and legs but this brand is definitely our new sunscreen for South Florida use, especially on our faces. Tried and tested at the beach, on the Ballfield and at Lake O. And playgrounds. Best for everyday use. I use it too on my face with eczema rosecea, no issues at all.

eos-eos

This lotion smells awesome. A little thick to spread and soak in, so do it before you go to where you're going to give it time to soak in or you'll be that guy on the beach with the white lotion face. Happy to do my part to keep the coral and sea life happy and works very well. I haven't been burnt in Nevis/St. Kits or Florida.

eos-eos

Our favorite sunscreen for kids, smells very nice and goes on easily. A little goes a long way so it is excellent value. Two pea sized amounts will easily cover a childs face and ears. This product has won several awards and gets rave reviews from various blogs and websites. It can separate and become liquid if left in direct sun, but that's only happened once in the several years we've been using it in the Texas sun.

After doing some research on sunscreens for my 2.5 year old daughter, I decided to try this one which came highly recommended by EWG.org. I had previously bought a couple others on the list, but didn't like the smell and consistency of them. I decided to try this one, as it was one of the more affordable ones on the list. It smells great, isn't greasy or too thick! Definitely a winner that I will purchase again and again. Already reccommended it to several of my Mommy friends!

eos-eos

I am surprised at how much I like this sunscreen. I only use zinc based sunscreens because regular chemical sunscreen cause breakouts on my skin, so finding one that has enough SPF that doesn't make your look like a complete ghost is a difficult task. I also cannot stand the smell of regular unscented zinc sunscreen, but this sunscreen smells of citrus fruit so it's easy on the nose. You do have to rub it in for a couple minutes before the white cast disappears. All in all, I highly recommend this zinc sunscreen.

eos-eos

I like this sunscreen. I have used this on the kids in Aruba, Florida, and many all-day summer lacrosse tournaments. I find this sunscreen consistently protects well and prevents sunburn under the eyes. For some reason with other brands, my kids tend to get red under their eyes. Not as easy to apply as some brands, but certainly not difficult.  This has been my go to for awhile, and I am glad a responsible, healthy option like this exists.

Our family loves thinksport and think baby sunscreen. Safe non nano mineral sunscreen that is relatively easy to spread, much easier to spread than badger! We reapply about every 2 hours and wear it all over faces and body! Have been using since baby was 6months and is perfect for my eczema prone sensitive skin girls!

eos-eos

Great sunscreen. I bought this after doing research to find a less-toxic sunscreen that was also user friendly. This one is perfect. It spreads almost as well as a chemical sunscreen - you need to rub it in a few seconds longer, but that's it. Once rubbed in, it isn't visible. It has a mild smell, doesn't feel or look greasy, doesn't make me break out, and is easy to wash off in the shower but stood up to sweat and swimming. I use it regularly and remain happy with it. I have tried several other non-chemical sunscreens and prefer this one due to it's easy of use.

I have used this sunscreen on my children for many years. It spreads better than any other mineral based sunscreen I have tried, and has a nice light scent. I sometimes miss the smell of the drugstore sunscreens (smells like vacation!) but the protection of this sunscreen and ingredients (reef safe!) make it a product I've gone back to again and again.

I have super sensitive skin and was afraid this would be irritating or at least leave a white film...it does neither! It rubs in wonderfully, smells absolutely amazing, and doesn’t cause any skin irritation. Also, it works! No burns since using this even after one application then being in the sun for 4 hours at ball games!

Thicker than store brands but goes on smoothly and rubs in easily. No stickiness or slimy feeling that alot of brands have. Nice, pleasant scent. Reapplied every couple hours but would sometimes go longer. I did get a little tan but no redness or sunburn over the course of 3 days at the lake. It was also great for the kids who didn't get burnt. They were very active in the water and sweating throughout the day, but this seemed to hold up well. No running into the eyes and causing them to burn. Overall very pleased with the product.

eos-eos

Great sunscreen! We've been using it for about 3 yrs now. It's the only sunscreen that doesn't give my kids a rash. Rated 1 on the EWG site gives me peace of mind knowing I'm not putting harmful chemicals on my kids. However, the bottle I have looks different than this one. My bottle has black letters not light blue letters. This might be a newer formulation so double check on the ewg to make sure it still has a 1 rating. Sometimes they change the formulation and add harmful chemicals. I'm hoping that it's not the case with this sunscreen.

I tried a more natural sunscreen and burned badly so I went back to researching and it brought me to this brand. After a long weekend tested in some very strong sun there was no redness no burn just a nice bronze sun kissed color!

We recently took this sunscreen on our trip to Belize and it worked wonderfully. No sunburns! Very waterproof, absorbs and spreads well. Don't hesitate to buy this and use it on your next vacation. Great for adults and kiddos alike.

I found this brand listed among the top in safety for your child's skin, as far as what chemicals are used in it. It costs less than the other "sport" varieties I found on that list. Yes, it costs more than the cheap brands, but I'd rather put less harmful stuff on my kids. It definitely works too, as I got burnt (forgetting to fully cover myself) while my kids avoided burn, using this product.

I bought 6 tubes for me and my husband to use in the Galapagos Islands. They were perfect! We didn't check any luggage so this size works perfectly for carry-on luggage regulations. The product smells wonderful and doesn't feel greasy. It works so well considering we were right by the equator and I'm VERY fair-skinned. Happy that I didn't get any sunburn during the two and a half weeks we were there. Also, the tubes go a long way. We came home with at least half of our supply! We used both used the sunscreen multiple times daily on vacation for two weeks so I really think that's an amazing value. It's affordable and much healthier for you than a typical sunscreen so what more could you ask for!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! I was super skeptical at first because of the lack of ingred, but I decided to go for it and we used it in Florida for a week and my son did not have a stitch of red. Goes on nice and thick and does rub in. Unlike some other reviews state!! No rash no issue. I have just ordered another one and the facial stick for my 4 year old. So nice knowing I am using something safe!!!!!

We used this on our kiddos (ages 3 & 5) all summer. It smells great, goes on easily, and provides great protection. I love that we were able to purchase in a 3oz bottle because I was able to toss it in carry on luggage don't have to worry about purchasing MORE sunscreen when we arrive at our destination. I will be purchasing the same product next summer!  The other BIG seller for us, none of the really BAD stuff found in other sunscreens.

My kids love this sunscreen and so do I. It has a pleasant smell and is easy to spread. It isn't super greasy like many others. It does a great job protecting their skin.
