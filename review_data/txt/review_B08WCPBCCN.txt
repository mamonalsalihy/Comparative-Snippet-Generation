Was disappointed with this product as even after reapplying it still led to some sunburn on fair skinned teen. Thought a solid would do better-this one did not.

Love this product!! So easy to apply on their faces

I read the reviews and thought this product sounded good but no way could it be that good. I applied this to both my sons who have completely different skin tones and it protected them both for around 2&1/2 hrs on the river. Product does say to reapply after 80 minutes but we did not. 10/10 for sure! We will be buying this every summer now to protect our little ones.

Works great for putting sunscreen on faces ears and neck. Takes the mess out of applying sunscreen

I put a ton on my 7-year-old for his Field Day at school and he came back completely sunburnt. I don't know if it rubbed off or just didn't work but can't risk it again.

Itâ€™s very expensive for the amount you get

Not as baby safe as I thought. Chemicals

8.00 for sunscreen that looks like a sample size. ðŸ™„ wonâ€™t be buying again and I love boogie products.

I love this one. My eyes normally sensitive for any sunscreen. But this one is fine for my eye. I bought for my daughter. But now we are using it all the time in Arizona summer. I love the coconut smell too. Itâ€™s little small. But I think this will lasting whole summer. Thanks for making good product.

Great sunscreen. Visible so you know where itâ€™s going but fades to clear so you donâ€™t look like you are preparing for a role in a kabuki theater. BUT, the size of these dispensers is minuscule. Making the $/Oz Not a good deal.
