I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen. The scent is mild, and the sunscreen goes on my skin like a dream. It also wears well under makeup, but I can’t wait to try Innisfree’s primer version. I’ve tried maybe 20 other sunscreens, American, Korean and Japanese, and this one is my top pick for everyday wear. I love it!! I will definitely purchase this SPF again.

I usually buy this from sephora but got them on sale from prime day! The best sunscreen I've used for the face. Makeup wears well when underneath. Lightweight, does not feel heavy. No whitecast either!

This sunscreen is amazing - there’s no white cast, no pilling, and no greasiness. It also moisturizes my skin and delivers the perfect amount of dewiness. The only thing that I didn’t like about it is that there’s a very strong sunscreen scent when first applied, but it goes away after a few minutes. Great sunscreen!

I have sensitive skin and other sensitive skin advertised sunscreen can still irritate my skin, especially around my eyes and when I have an eczema outbreak. This sunceeen does not- no irritation at all!  It also does not leave your face looking greasy and oily. Fast absorption with no need to apply powder to try tame any shine.

Love this sunscreen! I have very reactive, sensitive and oily skin. My skin loved this product! No reaction! No redness upon application which is what often happens with other products. No irritation or rash which is what often happens with sunscreen. Kept the oilies at bay while my skin felt moisturized. In the evening when I removed my make-up my skin felt great.

This is a nice light sunscreen, I am pleased so far. It had not caused me any breakouts so that is always a plus for me. It does have a light sunscreen type fragrance but it is not strong and it dissipates quickly. I have light to medium skin and it does not leave a white cast on my skin and it melts in quite nicely. I would recommend this sunscreen, it is a reasonable price too!  Edit: the matte primer sunscreen (pink package) in this line leaves a very apparent white cast and has a floral scent. Unless you are very fair, it will leave an obvious white tone to your skin. The product formulation itself is fine but the white cast was too much for me, so I returned the primer version and repurchased the regular version again.

I have heard good reviews about innisfree brand ovrerall, so when I looked for a sunscreen and this popped up, I read the reviews and took the plunge. This is a lightweight product, spreads easily. When you put in on it may feel white but just a few rubs and it’s gone. I have normal skin It is not super greasy but does leave a sheen on your face if you know what I am talking. I work in healthcare and masks are mandatory. By midday my lower part of the face gets dry because masks are soaking the product up while my unmasked part of the face still has sheen. For those people that use makeup on top of sunscreen you should not have any issues. I do not use make up regularly for work. I have used this sunscreen with makeup few times and there is no caking, balling I have noticed. Happy with product. No reactions, redness. Has mild more herbal type scent but not overpowering at all.

This sunscreen is ELITE. I’m an esthetician and I am always looking for the best SPF on the market. I have tried everything from Dermalogica to copper tone and everything in between and this stuff is the REAL DEAL. it’s silky smooth, easy to spread, no white cast whatsoever, no pilling up and rubbing off, and layers amazingly with makeup. It has a VERY light scent which is very non-offensive. It’s smells suuuuuper lightly of sunscreen which is kind of happy and nostalgic so I don’t mind it at all. It’s non greasy and I know I mentioned it before but I’m just so thrilled it doesn’t pill up and rub off. I have recommended this to everyone I know. AND THE PRICE POINT IS UNBEATABLE. five stars.

eos-eos

The title says it all but specifically I’ve been looking for sunscreens that don’t pill on me and this might finally be the one. I’ve been using for about a month and haven’t noticed any pilling throughout the day or upon reapplication. If you have super dry skin I def recommend.

This item is a win. Thick enough for my peace of mind like “yeah slab it on, block that sun”. But doesn’t leave any nasty sticky or oily feeling. I wore this over a moisturizer and layer make up on top of it. My face felt light all day. Not that heavy oily feeling. I normally don’t wear make up and even with all that combination I didn’t feel the need to wash it off after a few hours. Fantastic for my combination skin

I was on the hunt for a sunscreen that was made outside of the US so I could get access to more modern UV filters. After seeing this brand mentioned several times, I decided to try this one out. I am in love and never going back to US sunscreen. I have layered this over several different products and have experienced no pilling or separation. This provides my skin with a dewy finish that does not look greasy. This sunscreen does not break me out either.

eos-eos

I like this sunscreen a lot so far. I have no complaints, easy coverage on my combination skin, which makes it not such a chore to put on before makeup. Soaks in quickly, so you can move forward with moisturizer. It doesn’t smell like most sunscreens, which is a plus.

eos-eos

I have combination oily and dry skin so I was looking for a sunscreen that was light, and this is perfect. There is no white sheen left behind or clumping on my face, and makeup applies alright on top of it. Only Con is that there is a sunscreen smell when applied, but it fades in a few hours.

eos-eos

I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast and doesn't break me out. I have finally found it! Leaves my skin feeling great after I apply it and it doesn't interfere with my makeup.

eos-eos

It isn't very greasy and dries down quickly. Can sometimes give a white-cast if you apply too much in one go so do thin layers. It works great under my make-up and never affects the application or wear throughout the day. I can even use primer on top no problem. Recommend.

eos-eos

I’ve only worn it twice so far, but the texture is very good. My skin feels moisturized and it blends well

eos-eos

I like that this sunscreen feels like a regular lotion or moisturizer. It spreads easily and it does not leave a white mask on your face. My only complaint is that it does not come in a bigger size.

eos-eos

This is not drying or oily. It doesn't sit on the skin but it absorbs. It is not shiny. It is undetectable visually or to the touch. Lovely.

eos-eos

So the product is easy to spread, but you have to make sure to fully rub it in, because it is still sunscreen and it will leave a white cast if not rubbed into the skin properly. The smell is okay, again..it’s sunscreen. I have combination skin. Dry in my T zone and greasier than a Applebee’s fry station on a Saturday. And I find that I somehow get even more greasy with this product. I will use it until it’s out. But I don’t believe this product is a great match for my skin. If you aren’t super greasy like me, this could be perfect for you!

I have oily skin and have hated wearing sunscreen until I found this! Not greasy or heavy. Great mat finish that is wonderful under makeup! A bit of a scent not offensive. I will definitely up more!

eos-eos

First Korean sunscreen I'd direct anyone to! It leaves a dewy texture on your face and it's not sticky. Best of all, there's no white cast and it feels amazing on your skin. This is the sunscreen that doesn't make you feel like you're doing a chore everytime you apply it <3

eos-eos

I used to never wear sunscreen because I hated the texture and smell of it, but finally I found this one. The texture is amazing and moisturizing! I don't feel like my pores are clogged when I wear it and it has a really nice subtle scent so it's not overpowering. Also, it's so affordable compared to other sunscreen brands. If you're looking for a daily sunscreen to wear, I couldn't recommend this more. Buy it!

eos-eos

Doesn’t leave you white cast. Good choice

I purchased this product because I wear sunscreen everyday. Many times the sunscreen felt like I was wearing a mask but this one feels much lightehe aging process is preferable to the alternative ;).

favorite sunscreen. I am have an olive complexion (quite tan) and it doesn't leave a white-cast on my skin. It doesn't interfere with my makeup. No breakouts. No scent (that I've noticed).

eos-eos

This is a great daily sunscreen. I apply it each morning and it spreads easily. Usually a minute or two later I completely forget about because of how smoothly it absorbs. It feels great on my skin and has become a a normal part of my skin scare routine. Will buy again.

I have a very sensitive skin. And its a struggle to find a sunscreen that won't make me break out. This one is the best so far. I've been using this for quite a while now. Its so easy to spread and leave no white cast.

I have oily skin and notice that by the end of the day, my skin is super shiny. However, I live in Texas and its super hot all the time so I wont blame the product. It goes on super easily, it doesn't smell, and it doesn't leave any white residue. I really love it.

I’ve gone over 10+ sunscreens- this is the only one that can compete with my Eltamd. No pots clogging, no white cast, and a beautiful finish on skin

Great sunscreen, feels good on skin and is not not drying or irritating. Two thumbs up.

It is comparable to Elta MD which I love but it’s expensive. This one is nice feeling, smelling, and it has no flashback. I love it. I put it to the test on my weeklong cruise to Mexico!

This sunscreen has no white cast and is super easy to spread. It does have a slight sunscreen scent but I honestly don’t mind it. Highly recommend if your someone looking for a light, easy blending sunscreen; I will definitely be repurchasing !!!!

Hint: apply moisturizer first. Product went smoothly with no white film. I had no adverse affects other than a little tingling. Would recommend this to any of my sensitive friends. Finally, a product that I can love.

Un poco graso para el que no le gusta, no deja la estela blanca que los demás, la fragancia no es muy fuerte tampoco molesta

I ran out of my purito sunscreen and decided to give this one a try. No white cast no sticky residue. I have not use with foundation but so far so good. There is a slight sunscreen scent but it went away after a min or two.
