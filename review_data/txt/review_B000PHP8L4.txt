Didn’t have a packaging issue like other reviewers. Large bottle and very moisturizing without leaving a sticky residue. I use this on my arms and legs when I’m wearing short sleeves. Doesn’t leave a white cast either and i have a dark skin tone.

A friend told me about this sunscreen that her doctor recommended and I’m so glad she did. I wear it every day under my makeup. It keeps my skin clear and protected. No breakouts, no sunburns. Make sure you buy from Amazon directly so that you know you’re getting the legit product. I was hesitant to buy at first based on cost, but really, it lasts a long time since you don’t need much to cover your face and is so worth it. Would definitely recommend.

This product was originally suggested to me by my dermatologist. I had a horrible reaction to store bought sunblock after being in the strong sun in Aruba, I knew I needed something for sensitive skin. This sunblock is soft and moisturizing. It goes on smooth and doesn’t feel sticky or leave a white residue. I use this sunblock all over my body and I was thrilled to see it sold on amazon. The bottle surprisingly lasts a whole summer and it’s the only sunblock I’ll use now!

I really like this SPF cream. First of all it doesn't smell 'perfumey' - it might have a hint of suntan lotion smell, but it's really faint. Second this cream is NOT GREASY and disappears fast - even though it has 7% zinc oxide. Third it has 30+ SPF. I've finally had to admit that I need SPF when I'm outdoors given past brushes with melanoma coupled with my sincere desire to avoid looking like I have the hide of an alligator. And while not inexpensive, this is far less than the cost of a lot of the better-quality moisturizers for men. You usually get what you pay for and this is worth every penny. Finally, my better half tells me that this company doesn't test on animals. I believe that's a good thing. ;-)  Pros: • Non greasy formula that easily absorbs into skin • Odorless and transparent • 7% Zinc Oxide provides long lasting protection • Tested reliable 30+ SPF • UVA and UVB sun protection  Cons: • More expensive than drug-store brands

I have never written a review for a product before but felt the need to write one now because this product literally saved my summers. I few years ago I started to break out in the sun. It could be 60 degrees, but if it was sunny I'd turn red and start to itch on any exposed part of my body. I went to the dermatologist and he recommended EltaMD. I tried it occasionally but was also taking an antihistamine so I wasn't sure which was working. This year during the pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time at the beach. I realized quickly that if I took the antihistamine consistently I was wiped out so I tried to venture out to the beach with just the EltaMD sunscreen. It worked! I could sit on the beach without being uncomfortable. I began to wear it as my daily lotion and was able to head out without fear! It's light and pleasant to wear. I wear the face cream and body lotion. I highly highly recommend if you have any type of sensitivity to the sun!

I used the EltaMD SPF 30+ sunscreen on my face during my deployment in Africa. UV index was averaging 10-13 during my 6 month stay. I want to clarify that I only used this during my daily work routines such as walking around camp and I always wore a boonie hat. The bridge of my nose has always been sensitive to sun burn but the sunscreen helped minimize it. One time I was too lazy to put on sunscreen and my face burnt by just walking 3 minutes outside with only lotion! My poor nose and area under my eyes took a week to recover.  I don't recommend for high humidity areas and for working out. I ran 3-4 times a week and instead I used the UV Sport SPF 50.

Best sun screen I have ever used..... goes on clear and is not greasy. It can be used all over the body.. even the face. It does moisturize aned there is no heavy fragrance..... will continue to use this product.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is the best! Protective and moisturizing. My skin is super sensitive and this never irritates or dries my skin out. Not thick and goes on evenly like lotion. Highly recommend!!!

This sunblock prevented me from getting a terrible sunburn. I was in very intense sun for 3 hours and just turned brown. It’s not very greasy and only takes a small amount, like the size of a pea, to cover my face and ears, (which I sometimes forget to put sunblock on). I watched a dermatologist on TikTok and he recommended this product but he doesn’t sell it.

eos-eos

I rarely used sun screen because how it felt on my skin and concern for environmental impact. This product goes on smoothly, protects and absorbs quickly. You forget you are wearing it. Wonderful product.

eos-eos

My doctor told me I have to use sunbock with Zinc. This is the best clear sunblock with Zinc. I use it every day, and am never without it. (Badger is the best sunblock with Zinc, but it is not clear. I use this for my face, and Badger for the rest of my exposed skin.)

My derm recommended this product. I have been using it for several years now. I was pleased at how much less expensive it is here.

So happy to know that this product is now sold and shipped from Amazon. While the mfg wants you to purchase from dermatologists, I found out that Amazon IS an authentic seller. Woohoo! My friend got me this and I haven’t looked back since. Seriously, NO facial mineral based sunscreen can compare to this. EltaMD UV Facial goes on clear and is SO easy to blend. I got my friend and husband and kids to use this! Trust me, you won’t regret it!

eos-eos

I use this regularly and have it auto delivered in the summer. Light weight. Works on my face. No breakouts.

eos-eos

the product is 5 stars, no thick white skin w/this BUT, like other reviewers, after 3 months' usage, NOT daily, the pump cap failed. I removed it, cleaned it, no good..the bottle was almost full!--looks like as soon as the pump no longer touches the lotion, it stops working..so I've been using Qtips, and/or hitting the bottom of container to get a dollop...I plan to slice open the container w/a sharp knife and transfer contents..for this amt/ money, the company could come up w/a better "delivery system." Unless it's ?planned obsolescence," idea being that some customers will assume bottle is empty and re-order. Ecpected better from THIS company.

I got this for my husband who's dermatologist has told him he's at risk for skin cancer. Unfortunately, he doesn't like the smell, the white color or feel of sunblocks. So I found this one and the reviews came through for me! No fragrance and it goes on thin and blends in clear like a moisturizing lotion. In fact, the bottle indicates it has moisturizers. Plus the pump is so easy to use compared to the tubes and other lotions. He loves that there's no sticky feel plus the pump makes it so easy to put on in the morning. This is what sunblocks should be. I'm ordering another one for me.

I’ve used it for years! I have dry, sensitive skin and had not negative effects. Beach visits are easy, even in south Texas. Never had pink skin, much less a burn.

eos-eos

The only beans of sunscreen so use! It’s the best! It definitely works and is great on my skin. Highly recommend this product!

This is one of the few sunscreen products that doesn't contain cancer causing ingredients.

No smell or stinging feeling on your skin. Thick, but easy to apply.

Have used Elta products for years, they are recommended by my dermatologist who I trust. I have never burned since using this sunscreen. It is also totally clear so you don’t have that whitened look.

It is a zinc oxide sunscreen that doesn't feel oily or sticky.

eos-eos

This is excellent as a moisturizer and a sunscreen

eos-eos

They all claim no greasy residue, no unpleasantness, and then, nearly without exception, all sunscreens are slimy, stinky, and gross. Not this one. I use it more often because it really does go on light and comfortably.

eos-eos

I wear this sunscreen daily. It is part of my morning routine and I always put it on under my regular moisturizer. It is nice and light. not greasy. My dermatologist recommends this sunscreen as the best for my skin type.

eos-eos

Recommended by my dermatologist but way cheaper on Amazon. I have an allergy (sinus) to regular non-mineral sunscreens so I give this product two thumbs up! I use this product face neck and arms every day after being diagnosed and treated for basal cell. It's super comfortable and I don't need to take an antihistimine to wear it like the other stuff on the market.

eos-eos

I being using elta md for sun block for years now and this my first time purchasing it through amazon which a lot cheaper than any MD places. Love this sunblock, since i used this i never go back to any other sunblock. I recommend this sunblock to anyone i know, and them too love this sunblock after using it one time.

Good stuff. Appears to work really well as I have absolutely no tan and I live in Tucson. The only slightly negative I could advise is to be careful dispensing with the push down plunger on the top of the can. It seems to always dispense more than I want to use at one squirt. But all of this brands sunscreen products are quite effective. I've already had melanoma removed from my right face cheek ( I have a 2.5" scar to prove it) before I started using this cream. The depth of the cancer was shallow enough that it hadn't spread internally but the scare made a believer out of me. I no longer leave the house without a hat, sunglasses and this EltaMD UV lotion on my face, neck and arms. If you're worried that the white cream will look funny smeared on your skin, it doesn't. I guess it soaks in or something but it's not like having zinc cream sun block that life guards at the local public pool used to apply to their noses.

eos-eos

Best out there for fair skinned people who must be careful of skin cancer. I use this as a daily lotion after a shower so I don't have to worry, living my life at the beach in the past, I am paying the price now. Skin cancer and melanoma twice. Please don't be sorry later, and use sunscreen! This is highly recommended by doctors and it does well on sensitive skin.

eos-eos

My husband's doctor reccomended this after having skin cancer. We both use it daily, now. It doesn't feel greasy or sticky, like many sunblocks do. It just feels like putting on moisturizer, perhaps a little thicker. I've been very pleased.

eos-eos

I wanted an everyday moisturizing lotion that had SPF higher than 15, didn't rate too highly on the EWG list, and wasn't outrageously expensive. This lotion has gone through some changes and I did prefer the older version because you got more content but it's still a great product and I haven't found anything better.

eos-eos

This product is GREAT... especially for the Amazon price vs. the exorbitant in-office price my dermatologist sells it for. I started using this product over 3 years ago & I'm hooked! It isn't greasy and it actually leaves my face looking well-toned. I've also purchased facial sunscreen from Obagi, which is a great product, too, but a lot more expensive than Elta MD.

This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I have very fair skin, and am prone to sunburn (of course), freckles, and moles, and skin cancer seems to run in my family. I've been using this product for about 6 months now, and I love it. It's very light, goes on easily, and quickly absorbs. It doesn't irritate my skin or my eyes, and it doesn't have much of a scent at all. It purports to be a moisturizer and UVA/UVB sunscreen, but I find that it is not as moisturizing as I'd like it to be. In the summer it was fine, but I may need to add a layer of regular moisturizer along with this product during the winter. I highly recommend it, for daily use on the face, neck, hands, and arms.

Have use this product for years

I picked this UV lotion up after a recommendation from my dermatologist. It's fantastic. Moisturizes quite well, and the lotion doesn't have a greasy/oily left over residue that you can get from some UV lotions/sunblocks.

I always thought that any sunscreen would break me out. Decided to risk it and try this and am so glad I did!!! My skin has improved so much since adding this to my routine!!!!! So impressed!!

eos-eos

After doing extensive research and trying a few other brands, I'm happy with this one and will buy it again. Nice pump bottle, goes on easy and doesn't feel greasy and doesn't smell like the beach. Offers the protection I was looking for and I'd recommend this product to others.

eos-eos

Very good product. I am a redhead with very fair skin. Even in the cooler/cold months; I have to be careful when dealing with the sun's rays. This was recommended by my dermatologist. Very good. Works great on sensitive skin. No problems-no breakouts or irritation.

eos-eos

This is the best sunscreen I've ever used! As I have loads of skin cancer in my family, my dermatologist recommended I use this product. Having very sensitive skin & having undergone some IPL treatments, I use the face product every day, even in the WA winter! Will be purchasing the water resistant for an upcoming beach vacation. I've used some VERY expensive (Sisley, Darphin, etc.) sunscreens & none of them are half the product this is at 5-8 times the price.

I love the product but wasn’t happy that it wouldn’t pump. I had to take the lid off and dump it out. Wasteful.

I bought this first at my dermatologist's office, then checked Amazon and got a better deal! It acts as a moisturizer as well as sunscreen!

eos-eos

This sunscreen is by far my favorite sunscreen. It provides strong protection and one application seems to last a long time. I will only use Elta MD on my family. This particular EltaMD blends the best without having white coverage behind.

I love go to the beach but I always got sun allergy, I was skeptical about this, but what a great surprise.

Wanted a sunscreen that wasn't sticky or scented that I would wear every day. Living in FL and having abused my skin when I was young necessitates me using it daily now. Have introduced it to my friends and family.

Great product, recommended to me after a chemical peel by the dermatologist here in the US. HOWEVER, be prepared to surrender it to airport security abroad. It set off three separate bomb detectors in Amsterdam for one if its ingredients that is also used in making bombs, so the gun toting federal officials informed me.

eos-eos

Bought this for myself and love it! It is light and does not cause any adverse skin reaction. But, best of all, my husband will never wear sunscreen and did not even like putting sunscreen on my back because he hates the way that it feels on his hands! I talked him into putting some of this on for a "guys golf day" as it was 100+ degrees out. He came back without a sunburn, was grateful and now asks for it (and for days other than just golf!)

eos-eos

Love this product nice feel and glow! Stay away of eyes! Recommending this product!

eos-eos

I use this on my face and body and have had zero reactions. Its the perfect sunscreen! I use to purchase UV Clear 1.7 oz formulation (tinted) that is made for your face but decided to try this because its more cost effective. Though it doesn't have some of the key ingredients that UV Clear does, I don't see a big difference overall. The texture is a little bit thicker than UV Clear, which is not a deal breaker to me. And my make up still stays put under this.

Rub in not grease

Best sunscreen I've ever used. I like the ingredients. I have sensitive skin and get small bumps when I use drug store SPF, but when I switched to this sunscreen that never happened. This product is moisturizing and makes your skin look shiny but I don't mind. It protects against sun burn really well. When I wear this, I never worry about getting burned. Great stuff!
