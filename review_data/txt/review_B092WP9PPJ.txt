The quality is amazing. Feels great, NO gross sunscreen taste or any other annoying flavor, smooth and moisturizing without making my lips dry out later in the day.  My photos show the nude color on the left and the blush color on the right. I applied them super thick for the photo so you could see better, but they are both pretty sheer and subtle. I wasn't sure which to buy but I'm so glad I bought both because they both really match my natural coloring but the pink gives my face a bit more color while the nude is more natural. The nude does dissappear my lips slightly, however with the slight sheen I think it's really classy depending on my eye/outfit look for the day. So it's actually really nice to have both. Honestly my favorite thing to do is layer them both together; that matches my natural lip color the best. I'm a pale redhead. But they are sheer enough honestly I think both work work well on anyone. I think I might buy the other colors now too, if so I'll add photos of them also.  UPDATE Okay I added a photo with the spice and red colors. I like these too but with these darker colors the sheerness is kind of an issue. If you want bold color you have to apply really thick, which i did in the photo, but since they are pretty sheer they get kind of streaky and you'd have to reapply a lot. I have to really blend with a finger to even it out and then the color is not as sharp. I wouldn't just casually apply without a mirror as I could with the other colors. *however* if you don't use them as bright bold lipstick and instead just a hint to boost your natural color, I think they're great. You just may need to rub them in a bit.

The pink color is perfect! More of a dark, natural looking color. More of a lipstick than a lip tint. Very smooth feel on lips and glides on nicely. It offers nice coverage while still looking minimal. There is no smell or yucky taste. The applicator does not retract, so only roll up enough to apply. Like all lipsticks, you must reapply several times a day. Overall, I love it and have already ordered another tube! Well worth the price for 30 spf lip protection with color.

Product was defective, had gritty texture and went on unevenly. It seemed as if it was either really old or maybe had previously melted. Amazon rep said it would be replaced and no need to return defective product. The seller then contacted me and asked for a picture of defective product which i provided. They responded saying i would need to return for refund and put in new order if i wanted replacement. They would not exchange even though it said it was eligible. I asked again for exchange because the card I used would to pay for was no longer active (fsa card and can only use during specific period for tax reasons) in which I would’ve returned the product but they never responded. At least honor what you post. Waste of $20.

The worst experience ever! Very disappointed that I had to return this item twice and I was reimbursed with about 80% while sending this lipstick in the full price in a timely manner. I will be reaching to Amazon, not sure what happened. The first time I received this lipstick partially melted so I returned it for a replacement. The second one arrived looking a bit dry but intact, so I started using it. Two days later it split - see the pictures! I've never seen anything like this with any lipsticks before. I had to return it because it was completely unusable. Wow, what a ripoff and poor quality.

I have used this only a few times since I got it last week. It is very moisturizing and feels great on, with no smell or taste. My only issue is that the first time that I used it, I turned the tube just enough to put this on, then the tube would not go back down. I put the top on and smushed the lip balm just a bit, but thought it was ok. I put it in my purse and have used it a few times. Today, I made the mistake of turning the tube all the way up, in hopes of getting the lip balm to go all the way back down, and now it won't go down at all (see pic), so I can't put the top back on. I need to carry this in my purse! I will be returning this for an exchange.

This is a great product for the price. But no lie it straight up tastes like sunscreen. But it gives a great color can be used as a blush and it is pretty awesome but it completely tastes like you have a mouthful of sunscreen. Compared to color science which is somewhere around $30-$70 this is a great alternative. Nothing cheaper gives the lipstick color or feel. Not awful. Try one color to see that this is a good product. Can be used as blush. Great Spf

I love this! It's not shiny, not flavored, and is actually moisturizing and flattering. It ends up being the prettiest pink color on my lips when I just put this on alone and it doesn't end up feeling sticky and coming off on all my tea/water containers during the day. I finally found my perfect spf lip balm that's covered by my FSA account! I purchased the "shimmer" color and love it. I'm not sure if the tinted versions are as nice to wear but I highly recommend this one.

I have very chapped lips and I have so many different kinds of chapstick. I have spent so much money trying to find the right chapstick. This MDSolarSciences Hydrating Sheer has brought my lips back to life. I'm definitely buying another tube.

eos-eos

mechanical issue with tube, opened for first use, applied, tried to retract and it stayed put. i had to take the cover it came with and push it back in. should i return for a new one, or are they all like this?

eos-eos

These are perfect for everyday use!!! I keep one in my purse and one in my car. It is the perfect color, protects my lips from the sun, and is super moisturizing! I have these in Spice and Blush colors, both are nice but Spice is my fave!

This is an awesome SPF sheer lip balm. No more sunburned lips. It’s a beautiful neutral color, (not too light or too dark) great for casual makeup days. Applies smoothly and evenly. I purchased more for family. Highly recommend.

eos-eos

I love the shade. When you open it it looks like it will be way too bright and cakey-but it isn’t at all. Sheer hint of tint, sunblock and moisturizing-what more could you want?

eos-eos

I thought $20 was a little steep for a “chapstick” - but man, this is my new favorite lip balm! Super creamy and smooth, sheer color that’s very natural, and isn’t sticky at all.

eos-eos

Light color - very moisturizing- I love it …. It doesn’t take much heat to melt so be careful in Texas heat .

eos-eos

This was the best brand I stumbled across! Omg I just got a tube and keep it on me all the time.

eos-eos

Super soft on lips. I could use more colors and wear everyday. You have to reapply often but it’s worth it for preventing sun damage.

eos-eos

I was looking forward to getting this item but when I opened the lip balm it was smudged at the top (looked to be either melted or was used) and the tube was defective and would not retract at all. Very disappointed considering the cost.

eos-eos

Great product in that it’s very rich with moisture and love that it has an spf.

eos-eos

Makes my lips feel moist and love that looks like I have lipstick on.

Nice sheer color. No chemical flavor, smell, or aftertaste. Not particularly moisturizing, but not drying either. Will repurchase

Great color. Feels good on lips.

Love it doesn't irritate my lips and looks like a nice nude or tinted lip.

I was afraid this was going to be too RED but it's perfect! Subtle but definitely there. This will be a long term keeper!

Pleased with quality. Wish it had a bit more color but still like.

Hydrates your lips

I have trouble finding colors that work for me. This turns into the most amazing subtle color. Every time I wear it people say I look really good. And best of all, it feels nice and makes my lips smooth.

eos-eos

Really like this shade it’s very natural

eos-eos

The color is great indeed but I just hate lipsticks that taste like sunscreen. My sister doesnt mind it so I gave it to her.

eos-eos

Expensive. Worth it.

Great product.

bought one for my daughter, too

eos-eos

ok

Perfect color, very moisturizing.

eos-eos

Great color, moisturizing, & love that is has the broad spectrum SPF but it doesn’t twist up & down properly. You have to use your finger to push it down. Has happened before with this brand too! Customer service is great but it continues to be a problem!

eos-eos

I bought this to reapply after eating or drinking has partially worn off the lipstick and sunscreen I applied in the morning. It's perfect - blends nicely with the morning lipstick, no smell, moisturizing, broad spectrum UV protection, and I don't need a mirror to apply it. Because it's moisturizing, the formula is a little too soft for a stick and would be better in a pot. However, it comes with a little silicone plug/seal on the end of the tube when you remove the cap, and since I read the helpful reviews about it melting into the cap, I actually kept the silicone plug rather than tossing it and it appears to have solved that issue. Aside from my everyday usage, I've also taken it to the beach and on a weekend wine tasting trip and it performed very well and I found myself reaching for it often. The best sunscreen is the one you actually use!

eos-eos

A nice product - easy to apply, soft, color is great. I would buy more but there is one major problem - the dispenser is defective. As mentioned by other reviewers you cannot twist the lipstick down. So once you twist it up you either have to leave it up (and it will dry out) or push it back down which destroys and wastes the product.

eos-eos

Didn't like the product at all. It will melt before you know. Not worth $20. The product didn't go back into the container so be careful to only screw a little at a time. Neutrogena has a lip balm with spf (tinted and non tinted) for $6.99. Wish I had known about that before purchasing this one.

eos-eos

Good texture and color. I bought another!

eos-eos

It doesn't feel very much more moisturizing than regular lipstick. 💄 The only added benefit is the SPF. For the price, I'd rather just pick up a cheaper drugstore lip SPF. 💋

eos-eos

Has a relatively chemical smell. And the whole design feels cheap. Color is very light. I think if this is under 10$, I wouldn’t complain. For this price, I have no clue why. You can grab any tinted lip balm in cvs or Walgreens and it will do the same, if not better than this balm.

eos-eos

First order, the lipstick would not rewind back to its original setting. The box was badly damaged. Amazon replaced it, and the 2nd one worked. It’s ok, but not impressed. Would not buy again due to cost.

eos-eos

I purchased one a few months ago .. it's nice but the color doesn't last . I turned it to get it to move up but can't lower it back down. It's a good thing I barely opened it up. Month later I ordered a 2nd one of different color .. SAME PROBLEM. Paying $20 for this type of product SHOULD be working better. I just have to be careful opening it everytime to avoid having to throw it away because of this issue

eos-eos

I like the color and moisturizing aspects, but the case broke the first time I used it. It pushed up, but won't go back down so I can't put the cover on. The top part of the cover also cracked. I intend to try to continue using the product, as it was pretty expensive, but it's difficult with a broken case.

eos-eos

I love the spice color and it is very moisturizing on my lips. However, once I screw up the product, I have to use my finger to push it back into the case. This is way too expensive for that, will not buy it again.

eos-eos

I felt no colorless on my lip after I used it. Returned it. But it is balm kind. Rich moisturizer.

eos-eos

Two tubes the whole product has an issue. Breakage……lack of a true quality product.

eos-eos

Definitely not worth the cost. The color and texture Are both pretty awful

eos-eos

This product was not worth the price. It has a cheap plastic case and from the first time I used it, the lipstick won’t roll back down, I have to push it. It does roll on smooth but doesn’t keep my lips moisturized very long. I’m always looking for good quality vegan products and willing to pay for them but this doesn’t match my expectations at all.

eos-eos

It came ans it was broken. It doesn't twist well but I use a brush anyway.
