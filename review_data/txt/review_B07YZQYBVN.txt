Yall, I live in the south, where the summers are hotter than you know what. I am very fare skinned, so I typically burn within an hour of being in the sun. When I tell you that this sunscreen/tanning oil is the BEST, I mean, it's AMAZING! I've been using this for about a month and spray myself down whenever I go out, even if it's just for a few hours and I am so tan! I love it! Unfortunately, it doesn't last long and it seems they're sold out from Amazon.com and most stores.

This is an easy spray on that gives a tiny bit of color before heading to the beach. Will transfer a little if sprayed while in bathing suit; be careful, stand on a towel as it will make the floor slippery. Love this stuff. Sun protection is good but I reapply fairly often. Again, be careful if reapplying on beach and your suit is a light color. Otherwise, it’s awesome!

Super easy to spray and apply lasted pretty good in the sun and gave me a Gorgeous tan. Runs out pretty fast because of how much I use each application. You can see where You’ve sprayed. So you know where you’ve missed and I usually get 3 applications each bottle. It isnt streaky but gives a nice subtle tan. Evens your skin out. This is my new sunscreen forever!

I just used mine for the first time today and I was really relieved that the instant bronzer was very subtle. I can barely even tell that there’s any bronzer added. It’s also not greasy at all! I tanned outside for 20 minutes and I didn’t feel the need to shower afterwards because I didn’t get sticky, greasy, sweaty or smelly. The sunscreen smells great and I like the continuous spray because I can spray my whole body by myself (including my back). According to my Dminder app, the UV index during that time of the day was “very high” and I still didn’t get burnt. I have light skin and it takes a while for me to get tan, so I will edit this when I start to see a difference. I did have some tan lines after today, but i dont know if that’s from the instant bronzer or not haha

I vacationed in the Bahamas in February. Was skeptical on this because of the orange cast other ss with instant tanning left me with in the past, but I tend to head for shade and wanted to bring a tan back to the great Northeast. Unbelievable! I put it on in the morning before I dressed and reapplied at the beach. Did not have to worry about orange palms afterward either. Had a gorgeous tan when I came back that lasted for months, even though I did not use it once I went home to snowstorms and fake springtimes.

I love how a tan can change your overall appearance. However- I am always concerned about protecting myself from UV rays as skin cancer runs in my family. Even though I tend to brown rather than burn, Protecting my skin and preventing sun damage is paramount ..yet.(guilty of having my cake and eating it too syndrome!!) I cannot deny loving that natural glowing, moisturizing tan this product delivers!!!

First time buyer, was not disappointed! I’m a skin type II, and I have had trouble with sunscreen since my daughter was born, some of it gives me hives now. Because of this, I am super wary about what I use, and try to use mineral sunscreens for the whole family now. I spend a lot of my workday in the sun, so I have to reapply a few times a day and this doesn’t leave a funky sticky buildup, or any kind of white marks on ANYTHING! So very pleased with this because it smells great, it’s invisible, and it actually Works on my pasty/sensitive skin. Will be buying on repeat!

I love the smell of Australian Gold sunscreen and have purchased items from the full spectrum of Australian Gold products. The original (non-bronzing type) lotions, creams, and sprays smell the best to me. If applied appropriately and reapplied every 1-2 hours you will have great coverage and exponentially reduced risk for burns. The scent is tropical compared to the chemical-medicinal scent most sunscreens offer. Price is reasonable and comparable to other brands such as coppertone.

I love this Sunscreen! It easily sprays over the entire body at any angle, provides long lasting protection from the Sun- even in salt water, wind, and sweat, it dries quickly, and like all their products, smells amazing.

eos-eos

I have ordered this spray multiple times. It provides me with just enough protection for my easily tanned skin, leaves a nice bronze color when applied, but not too orange or streaky. The smell is nice. I do not use it on my face, because I do think it is too early for that particular spot. I really like it on my shoulders and on the tops of my feet, which burn pretty easily if I’m not careful.

eos-eos

Love it. A friend told me about it. I’m light colored and the bronze gives me a little bit of color while giving me the protection I need. I also like to give a quick spray on my face for color and protection. Someone told me I looked tanned. It’s not a big difference but a lil bit helps. It’s not an off color. Even though the spf is only 15 I haven’t burned with it. I’m at the ballpark quite a bit with grandkids. If I use anything much higher I won’t tan.

eos-eos

It’s hard finding a unscented spray that’s SPF50, but it does exist !! Bought this for my 3 year old who hates hates hates sunblock (especially the lotion!) This one is easy to put on and doesn’t require me to chase after my child or have a 10 minute argument about why it is necessary Definitely buying again!

eos-eos

I LOVE this product! It allows me to bronze up evenly, without streaks or run lines, and the added benefit of getting enough protection from the sun without interfering with me getting a tan (eventually to match the color of the product). The scent isn't that overpowering lotion smell, it's a faint smell which fades after it dries. It does provide a little moisturizing.

eos-eos

I give this product five stars. Australian gold is the only way to go get you some protection and enhances your tanning while doing so. The only thing is I don’t use this product with a white bathing suit. It is still amazing for tanning and it smells great

eos-eos

I use a LOT of Australian Gold sun products. I use this spray all the time. I used this on a Caribbean cruise, but I started with SPF 30 and then switched to SPF 15 later in the trip. I like that it adds some instant color while getting natural color.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen. Been using it for years. The scent is amazing! It's the only sunscreen that has ever worked for me. I am fair skinned and burn easily but with this I don't burn at all and I get an amazing tan and I spend hours at the pool. I use this along with the bronzing accelerator and it's a great combo. Buy this early because it sells out quickly and when it does come back in stock the price skyrockets!

eos-eos

Since last year this has been my favorite tanning sunscreen spray! it sells out fast in stores so was happy to see i could pick it up on amazon! the smell is light dosnt over kill! and it leaves you with beautiful bronze tan even after the 1st use!! highly recommend this product for summer or wanting a quick lasting glow

eos-eos

This is my go to sunscreen. The spray applies evenly. It gives a light glow, not a major change to appearance. It is moisturizing and doesn’t feel like makeup, unlike other tinted sunscreens. The sun protection is amazing. While you do need to reapply when in bright sunshine for a long time, the SPF 30 has been great at preventing sunburn. I wear this every day in the summer. It doesn’t rub off, but it can stain if you spray it directly on clothes or get dressed while it’s still wet on your skin.

eos-eos

I'll never use another sunscreen again! This stuff smells amazing (if you like piña coladas!), so much so that I actually WANT to reapply it regularly. The sprayer provides an even application. The bronzing additive is an extra perk with this product, too -- easy to see where it's been applied, and it provides a subtle temporary color boost.

eos-eos

Beautiful bronze color! Does not transfer after drying and is def water resistant! Instant bronze color after you spray it on! Australian gold has been around forever and it’s one of my favs!

eos-eos

I'm a black male and I kinda use this stuff kinda like women do makeup. I just close my eyes and spray a light layer over my whole face. It give it a perfect even doing tons that's not noticeable and don't wipe off just by rubbing

eos-eos

Have purchased for many years. Live in FLA. even talked to local distributors long before Amazon to find out why it wasn't sold here with less SPF or bronzer all year round. Happy to find on Amazon! Only negative is the spray bottle doesn't seem to last very long.... Performance: good all over coverage and protection while still looking brown/golden tan.

ALWAYS EASY TO USE CAN SPRAY MY OWN BACK LAST'S AWHILE DO REAPPLY AFTER SWIMING GOOD FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS IN THE SUN I ALWAYS RECOAT THAT WAY DONT WANT TO BURN.

eos-eos

This spray feels very light and comfortable when applied, and it works well too. But the real reason I love it is the scent. BEST SCENT out there! Whenever I ask someone to spray my back, they're like "Ooo! This smells wonderful!"

eos-eos

This makes me look nicely tan - not overly dark and not orange. It stays on throughout the day (I’m not in the water) and looks very natural.

eos-eos

I like the continuous spray. The scent is okay. I love it because it continues to spray if you hold it down. And that it has the tanner in it. Repeat customer.

eos-eos

i am obsessed with the smell of this product! it smells exactly how summer should smell. it gives your skin subtle color without making you look orange, and lasts a fairly long time in the hot sun (reapply every 3 hours). i have very fair and sensitive skin and this product is great! when you spray it on, make sure not to spray it too close, or it will appear drippy on your skin. it's easy to rub in.

eos-eos

this is the only sunscreen with SPF 30 that actually gives you a good color. it is hard to find in stores, so its great that i can get it on amazon.

eos-eos

Sent is very good, you should have somewhat of a base tan if you get 15 SPF, and this creates an illusion of color to your tan prior to exposure in the sun.

eos-eos

This is the best bronser ever! Goes on even and there is NO ORANGE GLOW! its brown and beautiful. Its a little sticky in the begining. Drys nicely and feels like all you have on is sunscreen. Awesome product Did i mention No orange glow!!

eos-eos

This is my go to sunscreen. My mom refuses to wear any bc she hates the sticky feeling but she actually likes this kinda so I bought 3 bottles bc you can’t find it at Walmart anymore. I apply once and I don’t burn but get a nice tan.

eos-eos

Love this product, it's the only spray I use! I even travel with it on vacation. I will not use anything else. Sprays even and gives your skin a nice warm glow ✨️

eos-eos

This is the best stuff I have found since the lion in sun tanning lotion. It's quick to apply and you get dark fast. There is not much of a scent, not oily or greasy and not sticky.

eos-eos

this works well. just be prepared to buy more as it goes fast. dont spray at the beach with all the wind, more goes in the air than your body...but that goes for all sprays.

eos-eos

This is a long standing company. Great products and I love the smell of it!

eos-eos

I usually spray it on my hand then apply to my face, The perfect glow that I was looking for ! 😊😍so if you love more of a dewy look without it feeling thick this is perfect.

eos-eos

My favorite sunscreen, as a cyclist. Absorbs quickly and keeps the sun out for a long while.

eos-eos

Have tried so many but this stuff protects and gives a golden tan

eos-eos

this sunscreen is awesome! it sprays a wide spray to cover a large amount at once, and it is easy to cover my whole body by myself. the best part is the tanner! it's such a nice glowy bronze i would wear out even at night! the smell is great too

eos-eos

The major reason I purchase this product - the signature tropical smell. It works well, just as good as other sunscreens, perhaps slightly more residue to wash off at the end of the day, but it gets the job done. This spray lasted a pair of us for a total of about 8 applications during our summer vacation.

eos-eos

Sprays on clear and dries immediately, no file, no grease, no white deposits

eos-eos

Was glad to find this having trouble to find in the store. Works great give you some color without turning orange and provide sun protection

eos-eos

Honestly, I bought this because of the fantastic smell. I’ve read that most sunscreen is ineffective, but I’ve not been sunburned at this point wearing this. I jog with it after letting it sit for around 30 minutes, and it holds up to a massive amount of sweating. This and Sunbum are my two favorites.

eos-eos

Excellent product! This brand never disappoints and always offers consistent sunburn protection for a ghostly pale ginger!

eos-eos

Protects as it bronzes your skin. Love this in the spray can not so much in the pump lotion. Great for pool or beach.

eos-eos

Goes on easy. Bronzer definitely amplifies your tan. Item arrived sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise.

eos-eos

Love every product I’ve tried of Australian Gold, this one has the best spray coverage ever and is perfect when you already have a base tan.

eos-eos

Already had some before, but the spray does finish quite quickly, but lovely to use

eos-eos

The smell is amazing, a lovely shimmering look on my body, sun block. It seems you tan so much faster. I will be buying more

The smell is more for a woman, than a guy, but does what it's supposed to.
