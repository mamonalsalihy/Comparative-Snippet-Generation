Would be great if it worked. Opened brand new bottle and it won’t spray and it can’t be returned☹️

Love this sunscreen and can't find at Walgreens anymore. Ordered this before and again few days ago ordering 2 cans but they will not spray. Despite turning top, they will not spray!! Very frustrating and won't let you replace. Have to call and request replacement.

I used it once and the spray quit working.

I bought 2 of these and neither of the caps would work. I had to rip off the caps and fix the nozzle, which still didn’t work. When I went to return it and told Amazon about the issue, I couldn’t return it. Don’t waste your money on this sunscreen.

Low odor, non-drying and not greasy! Husband loves its easy spray application.

This is a long standing company. Great products and I love the smell of it!

I give this product five stars. Australian gold is the only way to go get you some protection and enhances your tanning while doing so. The only thing is I don’t use this product with a white bathing suit. It is still amazing for tanning and it smells great

Just opened and doesn’t spray out
