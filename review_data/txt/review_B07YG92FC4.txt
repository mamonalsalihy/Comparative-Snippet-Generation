We bought the 30 spf, because at the time, the 50 spf contained a chemical banned in some states and at coral reefs. We figured Neutogena would be a good product, and it did not disappoint!  My husband hates anything on his skin that his sticky or greasy, and the fact is that most of us don't like it. This was easy to apply, and it was not greasy or sticky at all! It kept us protected during an afternoon of kayaking in the sun. Best product we have used so far!

Stood up to the hot Mexican sun in Cancun! I only applied in the mornings and never burned! I’m very fair skinned. Kinda sad I didn’t get a good tan lol.

I use this sunscreen daily whether I am out running or driving in my car. It absorbs quickly, stays on when I sweat during exercise, and doesn't have that strange chemical smell that some products have.

Works very well and is not greasy. I won't use any other brand after trying this

I have used twice to date and satisfied with the protection. No sunburn on exposed face and arms. It pours fast so no need to apply much pressure when squeezing out.

Great price ...good product.

I am on a quest to find the perfect everyday sunblock, and unfortunately this is not it. I purchased this because some YouTube dermatologist recommended it as a cheaper alternative to their Ultrasheer line, which I have used in the past.  I don't understand the oil-free, non-greasy claims because after one proper (ie heavy) application, my face looked like an oil slick. The greasy sheen did not rub in, absorb or go away all day.  Now, all that said, I am keeping this sunscreen because I will definitely wear it on my body, especially when I know I'll be active and be out on the sun.

I guess it did what it was supposed to do, it just left a white film on my brown skin.

I didn't get sunburned using this! That's the important part. However, I have yet to use a sunscreen that allows your skin to breathe. I feel like my skin is always suffocating and then I get sweaty and sticky. Ugh. The good part...this works.

I received the sunscreen in January of 2022 and the bottle reads expired 01/22. Waste of money

Not safe to use!!!! Ingredients in this product are harmful!

This sunscreen is amazing! I do not burn at all where I put it. I was in the sun for about 6 hours and was not burnt. I honestly didn’t even reapply (don’t do what I did.) I missed a spot on my back and I burnt in that spot super bad but no other part of my body got any sun damage. This sunscreen is amazing!

Good sunscreen. Just got it at Walmart for two dollars and it was the regular price.

Good

As an extremely fair redhead, I burn in about 30 seconds. This is the best sunblock I have found - and it lasts and works even in the ocean!

Item very stick and icky

It smells nice water proof and does not feel sticky when you use all over your body.
