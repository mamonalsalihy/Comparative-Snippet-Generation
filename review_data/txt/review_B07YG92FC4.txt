Good sunscreen. Just got it at Walmart for two dollars and it was the regular price.

I didn't get sunburned using this! That's the important part. However, I have yet to use a sunscreen that allows your skin to breathe. I feel like my skin is always suffocating and then I get sweaty and sticky. Ugh. The good part...this works.

Stood up to the hot Mexican sun in Cancun! I only applied in the mornings and never burned! I’m very fair skinned. Kinda sad I didn’t get a good tan lol.

I have used twice to date and satisfied with the protection. No sunburn on exposed face and arms. It pours fast so no need to apply much pressure when squeezing out.

This sunscreen is amazing! Stays on through sweat and waves. Amazing protection.

I received the sunscreen in January of 2022 and the bottle reads expired 01/22. Waste of money
