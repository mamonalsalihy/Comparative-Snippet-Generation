My long, long search for a safe sunscreen is over! I've been very discouraged by finding all the really safe ones tend to be pasty and white and require a lot of rubbing. This product does go on white, but is rubbed completely in in about two swipes. And the white means you can see where it landed when you sprayed it. Once you rub it in, it is very light, completely non-oily. I've never liked using sunscreens under makeup or applying it just to go out for a walk, but this is light enough that the skin can still breathe and I forget I am wearing it almost immediately. I have not fully tested its protection powers, and will edit this if I am dissatisfied on that point.  edited to add: I've used this for a week now. Protection has been very good. I took more sun than usual, on first exposure and for three days, and never burned.

I’m really happy there’s a natural sunscreen in spray form! It’s very convenient and works well. My daughter is a fair skinned red head and this lasts for hours in the pool in mid afternoon sun without re-application. It seems to be running out pretty quickly though, not sure I can afford to use it all summer long. Also make sure to spray in the grass and away from things b/c it really sticks to and stays on them. I still see it on my garbage can and concrete on the patio after a few weeks and storms. Yet it rubs into the skin nicely and seems to wash off in the shower ok.

I have been trying toxicity sunscreens for years, and this is by far my favorite - especially for kids. It sprays on easily and then you run it in quickly. If you don’t rub it in right away you end up white - so do one limb at a time. That said- it’s the lowest toxicity rating on EWG for a spray (3 out of 10) and works really well. Smells good. Stays on. Kids don’t complain. I’m a huge fan.

I love this sunscreen and have been carrying a can in my bag all this summer. To address a couple of common complaints:  “It’s not sheer at all”: “Sheer” does not mean the same thing as “clear,” people. This spray is white and absolutely does rub in to be sheer as advertised. It leaves a slight (“sheer”) white tinge after rubbing in, but it’s not super noticeable on my pale skin. It might be more problematic on darker skin tones. (Also, it should be noted that there is literally no such thing as clear mineral sunscreen- you will have to choose between a product like this and a clear one containing endocrine disruptors. I’d rather look a little pasty, personally.)  “My whole family used this and got burned”: You need to shake the can before spraying, as per the instructions. These sprays are made of zinc (the active, protective ingredient) in a liquid suspension. If you spray without shaking the can first, you risk getting all liquid and no zinc particles, and then yes, you will burn. I’m pretty sensitive and this sunscreen has not failed me yet.  “It’s hard to get off”: This is true. It is hard to get off. But why would you want a sunscreen to come off easily?? This stuff is water resistant to an impressive degree. In the evening if it takes a vigorous scrubbing to get it off, I consider the exfoliation a bonus.  Also, my nozzles have worked just fine and the cans last me quite a good amount of time.

Out of all the zinc sprays that came out this year (2016) this is the best I've tried. It doesn't make you look like you have very white or silver skin and it rubs in pretty easily. Some of them are like spraying white clown face paint all over your skin leaving you looking like a crazy person and forcing you to resort to the less healthy options. I will stick with this one until someone comes out with a completely clear option!

Spent a lot of time researching spray sunscreens to use periodically when I got too lazy to re-apply or if going out in the evening for a walk. Had good ratings on EWG. It sprays on white because Of the high zinc levels but that doesn’t bother me—if anything it’s reassuring. It can be rubbed in but like any other zinc lotion it takes a bit more work to do so. Overall I would recommend this as a spray sunscreen

eos-eos

I am the white-est white girl. I am translucent. I live in the Florida Keys where the sun is really intense. But when I use this stuff I don't burn. I was super hesitant because its only SPF 30, but it works better than the Neutregena 50 and 70 stuff I had bought previously. And the environmental working group rates it well. I have sensitive skin/weird sensitivities --- like I have woken up after spending the night at a hotel and my face is blotchy and swollen like I have been smacked around b/c of whatever they wash they sheets in--- and I have not had a reaction to this, nor has it made my face breakout. I feel like when it is on, it is on - that I am not sweating it off. The spray bottle never clogged on me. The reasons that my experience may be different that other ppl: 1.ppl complain that they can still see the sunscreen once applied and that it is not clear/sheer...I am so white that I can't tell. Looks like I have nothing on. 2. I never assumed I didn't have to rub it in. Come on, srsly, did you think you'd just walk into a mist of it like you spray on perfume and you'd be covered? Spray it on, rub it in and it dries fast and even.  I am pretty lax in remembering to leave reviews (though I read other ppls all the time!!! and really appreciate them) but I am here re-ordering so I figured i might as well. I had run out and decided to buy whatever mineral sunscreen was being sold at Publix, but it sucked. And then I went to the beach last weekend and used my friend's leading aerosol sunscreen and not only did I feel greasy AF it actually started to melt my fingernail polish. WTF

Yes this leaves a super white residue, but what I do is spray it on everyone then wait a minute or two, then rub it in. It doesn’t say that on the directions but it works and our pale skin doesn’t burn. I reapply it a lot, about every 30 minutes (we live in Southern California) when in direct sun. Also, I don’t use this on the face, I use badger sport for face. Yes it’s a pain, I put towels down and spray outside so it doesn’t leave a spray paint residue, but it’s better than the toxic ingredients found in other sunscreens (oxybenzone and avobenzone are toxic especially when in contact with chlorine). Zinc oxide and titanium oxide are the only FDA approved ingredients for sunscreen, the rest are still being tested but I would prefer not to test on my family.

I am very serious about nontoxic products for my family, particularly for my young children. I also insist on sunscreen almost every day. The unfortunate thing is that I really dislike actually applying sunscreen! lol! I don't mind on normal mornings (and we usually use the Green Screen Organic Sunscreen SPF 32 Original - Vegan - Gluten-free or Babo Botanicals SPF 40 Daily Sheer Facial Sunscreen, Unscented), but when we are on the go or at the beach, I wanted to make it as easy as possible to apply. We bought this for a beach getaway over the summer and it really surprised me. It is an easy application (shake, spray, rub) and it really worked. Two children and two adults used this on the entire body and face along with some extra stick protection on the face. I reapplied a few times, but not religiously and no one got a burn... no one really even got a tan. It says that it is sweat and water proof up until a certain point and I believe it really is because we were in scorching heat on the beach (in the water too) and no one had any issues. The great thing is that it really did make application easy so I think we reapplied more appropriately than we would have with a regular tube of sublock. I am not experienced with spray sunblocks so I cannot compare with others, but I believe it is similar. Note, since this is a nontoxic sublock that is zinc based, it does go on white and also sprays whatever it gets on white, but I didn't have any problems. It rubs in very easily and seemed to come off of carpet, clothes, etc. very easily as well. This is now a regular go-to for us even on non-beach days.

I really like this sunscreen so far. We’ve been using it for days in the sun for my 6 month old daughter and our family. I feel safe and comfortable putting it on her since it’s a clean sunscreen and the best part is it doesn’t leave that heavy white cast that other natural sunscreens do. I have brown skin and I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find that if I rub it in immediately after spraying on, it pretty much blends. Haven’t had a sun burn with this either on my daughter so I assume it’s doing the job! Definitely suggest for sensitive skin and new baby skin! Good for the whole family.

I have invested so much time to compare ingredients of many “natural”, organic, eco-friendly, non-toxic sunscreens. 1) If you be strict you should avoid butylparaben, octinoxate, triclosan, PABA, octocrylene, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor. 2) I’m a big fan of CA based 100%pure company but I have chosen this sunscreen over theirs. This one I use when I need to put something very quick for protection. Otherwise, your choice for everyday use should always be a non-spray type of sunscreen, due to spray nature. 3) Beware, even if it’s marked as “mineral based”, always check full ingredient list. They are always trade offs for 100% natural sunscreen (they tend to be whiter and thicker), lighter ones for a perfect look always have some additives, not truly natural, IMO, so choose based on occasion.

eos-eos

I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen! I've been using mineral based sunscreen only for a few years now as the others are toxic and not as effective. I don't love how sticky and WHITE most of them leave your skin and much prefer the convenience of spray sunscreens. But they're impossible to find in mineral based formualas. This is the ONLY continuous spray, mineral sunscreen I've found and it's soooooo nice! It goes on smooth and even and when you rub it in it's not greasy or sticky at all! My skin feels baby soft - no joke! There's still a white residue, because it's mineral, but it's not nearly as bad as the creams. The only thing I'd change would be to offer a higher SPF, a 50 would be ideal for our super pale family :)

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen! Being in the medical skincare industry I have been made well aware of all different types of sunscreen and their ingredients. This is one of the best sunscreens on the market without question. I personally haven’t experienced any issue with getting it to rub in. Zinc will always come out white but I seem to get it to rub in nicely. I use this on my entire family, including our babies. Knowing it’s actually protecting them and not full of harmful chemicals makes me feel so confident in having them outdoors in the sunny state of Arizona that we live in.

I am working towards reducing chemicals in my household & body. This sunscreen had the lowest rating for toxins on the think dirty app. I bought this for our trip to Florida in March and no one in my family got burnt. I’ve been using it ever since our trip and it is a really solid sunscreen. By far the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. After applying a second coat it can be hard to blend the sunscreen fully into your skin but I believe that is just due to the zinc. And who cares. It does it’s job! It also is not oily AT ALL. Huge bonus.

We have been using this for our toddler's daycare everyday. She is very fair skinned and blonde. We took a family trip to Greece which included many trips to the beach and island hopping. All I can say is WOW!!! We were shocked at how well it worked in the intense sun at the beaches. Her hair is thin and blonde and we also put this on her head as well as her whole body. In 2 1/2 weeks we never had an issue w sunburn! I even used it on my face and shoulders since I am fair too!. We were so happy w how it worked and we didn't need to reapply all the time. Worked great in the water too. We will continue to use this product as an everyday use, but good to know if we travel or are in intense sun, this will protect the fairest and delicate of skin! Thanks.

eos-eos

I have very sensitive skin. I already use the cream option of this product. Is the only sun block product that won’t make my skin itch and I can stay in the sun for hours with minimal reapplying. I was so excited to see the spray. Easy to apply, just make sure to rub the product into your skin really good and wash your hands throughly if you don’t want the random white spots. I don’t mind so much, I’m more concerned about protecting my skin than how I look doing it lol.

eos-eos

This stuff is great. Normally when buying a green sunscreen, I have to sacrifice the aerosol feature and default to a lotion. This has a very neutral scent and sprays easily and evenly. It is zinc-based, so it will leave a white haze on your skin. I did need to rub it in after spraying, which helped minimize the white hue. It does love bathing suits, so be prepared to also rub the zinc powder into your bathing suit, otherwise it will be spray painted white. I used this while tubing and did not get burned--just nice and toasty-tan. The biggest downside is that it has a very slight stickiness/tackiness to it. I showered twice before I finally felt like it was all off my skin. But at least it didn't come off in the river!

eos-eos

This is an absolute must if you have fair skin, burn easily, or just want great sun protection for you or your kiddos. If your sunscreen doesn’t have zinc, it’s probably not working. This brand has you covered though! Sprays on white, easily rubs in clear, smells great, and offers perfect protection! I go to Mexico every year, and prior to finding this product I always came home looking like a lobster. Now that I have been using this I never burn while still getting a bit of a tan. This is the only sunscreen you’ll ever need!

eos-eos

This exceeded my expectations for a sunscreen that is ACTUALLY pretty eco friendly. Because this sunscreen uses micro particles rather than nano particles of zinc oxide, it will not be absorbed into your skin like some other "reef safe" sunscreens. While this is good for both your health and the fish, the sunscreen is not 100% invisible.  That said, the chalkiness was minimal and we survived a week in USVI without burns. You do need to rub the product in after spraying, so be sure to bring a friend!

eos-eos

Very good sunscreen, it does the job, although you need to renew it at reasonable intervals if you're under the sun for long, and in and out of the water. Like every other mineral sunscreens, it takes a bit more effort to spread, but the spray helps a lot. Importantly, it did not cause any skin irritation/rash, unlike a mineral sunscreen from another brand we have used previously.

eos-eos

This works excellent! And as some other reviews have stated, not sure why some say it doesn't rub in and leaves you painted white... This was not the case at all on any of my family members with varying skin tones. Sure initially you could still see a hint of it after rubbing in but it soaked in shortly after. We were very pleased with this! We used it on our young children this past weekend on the hottest day so far this Summer...Real feel was about 110, and not cloudy...They were outside and in the lake most of the day and did not burn! Follow the directions on the bottle and you'll be set!

eos-eos

I have tried a ton of material sunscreens because I care about what I put on/in my body. This, by FAR, goes on the smoothest, has the best results and has the lightest feel and scent. It does go on white, but that's with all zinc products. But it is so easy to blend it in. After a day at the beach and only 1 reapplication, I came home completely protected, not one red spot. Came off nicely with gentle exfoliation in the shower. I will be buying more of this sunscreen! Well worth it!

turns your kids white! I had my daughter pose! 😀😂

Spray sunscreens with clean ingredients are pretty impossible to find since the ingredients that make it spreadable/sprayable are the yuck ones. HOWEVER this is great! You do still have to do a tiny bit of rubbing but still SO much faster than the lotion kind! Will absolutely be purchasing for vacation this winter and next summer!

eos-eos

Since I've made the switch to sunscreens with less harmful ingredients I've been missing the ease of using a spray. I am so happy I found this product! The ingredients list is great, it's easy to apply and it worked for us at the beach. The consistency is similar to other products I've used but is definitely thinner. As long as you rub it in decently it doesn't leave much white behind, if any at all. I will continue to purchase and use this product.

eos-eos

Love this product! Non toxic! No smell. Great price. Sprays on clear. Inexpensive. Sun protection could probably be a little better thou.  They also have a baby sunscreen roll on stick for the face that I love.  I was buying 100% pure sunscreen due to low toxicity but it is $40 for a small bottle. Very happy I found this product to use.  Great ranking on the app “think dirty” that shows toxicity of products.  With sunscreen you definitely don’t want toxins in the body when sweating and in the hot sun.

eos-eos

Pros: unscented, sprays and spreads easily, non-greasy, doesn’t sting or make eyes water, non-irritating, lasts several hours of normal activity, reef safe. ethical company, cruelty-free, vegan, no apparent white cast Cons: none so far Bottom line: Though it is expensive, this spray sunscreen works even on my very pale and sensitive skin. There are no issues with sensitivity or iffy ingredients. Highly recommended

So I have even white skin and psoriasis. When I use this product on my skin it protects from the sun and also lowers the plaques of my psoriasis. The oils in this spray not only protect from the sun (make sure you apply in consistently) but moisturize your skin. And Ive paid more for a lesser sunscreen. P.S. I am on a biologic for my psoriasis. This isn't a cure but its a great compliment.

Easy fine mist application for wrangling with a squirming child who hates sunscreen application time. No smell. I've tried a few and I come back to this because I think it's as good as mineral based sunscreens can get. It will leave some white glow, as all mineral based sunscreens do, but it's not that bad. I originally got it for my son who got a rash from other sunscreens. I use it for myself too now.

eos-eos

I liked this sunscreen. It sprays on easily and covers well. I didn't feel like it left white residue. It protected me well at the beach. My husband didn't like it as well, he felt it didn't rub in as well on hairy arms and legs and left a whitish residue, but he hates wearing sunscreen of any kind.

I am all about using natural safe products on myself and my family and this sunscreen is exactly that! It has an easy spray on nozzle and feels very light on your skin, you don't even notice you're wearing it. I use it on myself and my child with no skin reactions and have never had as much as a tan line while wearing this product. We also frequently go in the pool with this on and it does not wash off or run in our eyes. It doesn't really have a smell which is also a plus!

eos-eos

Been looking for a spray sunscreen that does not trigger my son's skin allergies. After we received this one, kiddo tested it on his arm where there is already mildly irritatrd skin and it did not cause ANY burning or itching. This is will be the new body sunscreen for our family. Glad I found it!

eos-eos

This rubs in almost clear and dries completely so there is not greasy look. It has a little bit of a white cast but all non tinted mineral sunscreens do, this sunscreen has the least amount of white cast out of the non tinted mineral sunscreens I've tried. The sprayer is also much more convenient than lotion versions.

eos-eos

Must rub in vigorously to get the sunscreen to disipate it's white color but that was to be expected with zinc sunscreen. It's protects me pretty well but I'm pretty tan already. I work on roof tops slot and this definitely prevents me from roasting like a lobster. I re apply one or twice as I sweat a lot when working and it dose what it says.

eos-eos

Honestly the best I’ve used by far! Yes it does leave white on my toddler but that’s why I love it so much. You will know you haven’t missed a spot. You can easily rub it and the white will go away but it’s not that bad honestly. My daughter and husband hasn’t burned since! Love love this brand and will buy more every summer!

I like to spray this mid day after I already applied sunscreen in the morning. I easily break out and have sensitive skin. This does not break me out. It’s not greasy or drying. Doesn’t sting eyes either. Only sunscreen spray I’ve found that doesn’t break me out or irritate my skin. I hope this formula never changes.

I used this at the beach. I use sunscreen without lots of chemicals and this was perfect. I burn easily but did not with this. You do have to rub it in after applying as it goes on white, but it was easy. I will. Up this again.

This product is one of the most pleasing textures for sunscreen I have experienced, and it blends in incredibly well, you wouldn't even know that it's a mineral sunscreen. There is no scent and my husband who hates sunscreen is a fan.

I used this for my child and spouse and self for a beach vacation. It made it so much easier to get ready to go to the beach and the sun protection was great, no one got a sunburn. You don't get as much product with the spray style but the trade off in quick application make it worth it. Also, one bottle lasted the 3 of us 6 days and that is with all of us doing multiple applications a day.

I have been seeking out mineral-based sunscreens that are easy to spread and do not leave you with a horrible white film that just doesn't go away. This is the first mineral-based sunscreen I have ever found that goes on smoothly, rubs in well and does not leave you all white and greasy. I LOVE this sunscreen.

eos-eos

I'm very white and usually shy away from direct sun exposure because I'm so self-conscious about getting any kind of sunburn. I wear this sunscreen almost every day at the beach and stay out for hours in the ocean and pool. I'd say it lasts a good 90 minutes before needing to be reapplied. I pushed the limit of the 90 minutes the other day and only BARELY started to get red. This sunscreen has a very natural scent. The sunscreen will leave a slight white haze on your skin but nothing too drastic. I haven't seen any stains from the sunscreen on my black swimsuits so far.

This light spray covers thoroughly. No toxic chemicals that we know of. It's pricey, but a little goes a long way. Give it as a gift at the end of the school year and beginning of beach season!

My family really likes this sunscreen. After trying other mineral based non-spray sunscreen, they are much happier with Babo Botanicals spray sunscreen. It's easy to apply, goes on mostly clear (a little rubbing is necessary, but nothing major) and it works. We've used it at the pool and for other summer activities with no sunburns! Love that it's fragrance-free, too.

Goes on easily. Is easy to blend into skin so there's no white residue. Purchased early March and have been spraying it in every day on hands, arms, chest and neck, feet and 1/2 leg and it still has not run out (though I suspect the time is coming which is why am reordering this product)

Love how long this has lasted! I bought one canister of this last year and am STILL using it. Works well. Rubs in easily and doesn't wear off too quickly. Worth the money!

Best sunscreen I’ve ever used. I used it on my daughter & she didn’t get any sun. She left the splash pad as white as when she walked in. Of course like any sunscreen, it needs to be reapplied. You do need to rub it in. It dries on the skin & doesn’t rub off, which I like. It does leave a chalky white hazy finish but that doesn’t bother me. It’s a mineral sunscreen so that should be expected. We use a liquid blue lizard sunscreen on our faces. This is a great body sunscreen that we’ll stick with!

I am completely in love with this product!!! Its ingredients ara completely clean and it really does the job! I went to Brazil for the New Years , was at the beach all day and didn't get sunburn! I went to the water and after some hour I could see the sunscreens still there! It gets your skin a little white for a while , but if if you rub really well you barely can see. I highly recommend this product!

Best mineral spray sunscreen yet. Spray works well, doesn’t clog, does require some blending and leaves behind a faint white cast (because it’s mineral) but in the world of mineral sunscreens, this blends in well! Buying again.

My best friend has MCS and so I've had to try and figure out replacements for a lot of the stuff that I was using. Sun screen though is the killer for me. I am so pale that it's almost meme level compared to my friends. So going out into the sunshine for a few hours is rough. This however worked! I was able to apply it and hang out with her for 8+ hours in the direct sunshine and no sunburn.

eos-eos

I've finally found a spray sunscreen that I like! It's not a chemical sunscreen, which my skin reacts to, and isn't greasy. It leaves a very faint whitish cast, but for me this is not a problem because of my light skin tone. I could see that being an issue for those with darker skin than me.
