This is not sheer, it is not the worst but does leave traces of white. Not bad on fair skin on darker skin it is more visible. Will not be buying again.

This worked GREAT, for the very first time. It sprayed on sheer. Too bad, going forward it sprayed out little specs of white (I am guessing that's the zinc), so you look like you spray painted yourself. Then you would try to spread out the white specs and your skin feels so gunky so definitely wouldn't recommend it for sensitive skin.

I love this brand but this sunscreen is bad. We used it and reapplied hourly and we all burned really bad. It wasn’t easy to blend either. Left a white cast of the skin and white zinc particles. I don’t mind the white cast asking as it actually works which this didn’t.

This definitely protects against sunburn when applied properly. It’s best to spray it in your hand and then on your body because of the spray mechanism going everywhere. Like most mineral-based sunblocks it’s difficult to get it off of your skin. But it definitely does the job without all the weird chemicals

This is quite possibly the worst sunscreen I’ve ever tried as it offers zero sun protection! Was outside for less than 30 minutes and was fried after putting this on. Save your money and buy something better!

Good sunscreen but the spray is terrible. It comes out soooo splotchy and stark white

Works well against sunburn, however it sprays white and sticks/stains any material it gets on.

It’s a mineral sunscreen so it’s not sheer, but not too bad to rub in. Stains terribly though! We put sunscreen on before driving to the pool and there are white spots all over my car, even though we ruined it in. And the spray nozzle works way better than any other mineral spray I’ve tried…almost too well. From 8-10” away, it created a 2’ circle of spray, so the overspray goes EVERYWHERE. My deck has two-week-old sunscreen all over the steps. Overall not worth it. Just use a cream.

Really disappointed. Burnt to a crisp. I had higher hopes for this product

Very disappointed. This is advertised as “ultra-sheer” - and it’s nothing but the opposite. Like spraying chalk on your kids
