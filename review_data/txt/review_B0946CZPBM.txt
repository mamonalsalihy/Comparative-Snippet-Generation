Finally, a sunscreen that works for my sensitive skin. I have both a fragrance and compositae mix allergy, so it’s hard to find something that doesn’t have either fragrance or some plant extract. Skincare companies will remove fragrance and then frustratingly turn around and add botanicals.  My docs recommended Vanicream products such as cleanser & moisturizer, which I really enjoy. I tried the other mineral sunscreen Vamicream offers, not sure if it’s 35 SPF or just a different formulation of this same spf 50 one but it didn’t work for me. It was hard to blend in to skin and major white cast. I didn’t use it after a couple of trys. I’ve been using Elta MD but that’s pricey for 1.7 oz and with sensitive skin my derm recommended mineral SPF.  This Vanicream SPF 50 is wonderful. I’m Latinx so I’m sort of medium to tan and this sunscreen blends beautifully. There’s just a hint of a cast buy after a few minutes the cast is gone. It takes a little longer to dry off or sink in but that’s ok because I’m just kind of glowy, this is NOT tacky. One thing to keep in mind though is that this has a lot of allantoin which is super moisturizing, so if you have slightly dryer skin like me, this will be great. I don’t know how oily skin will do with it.  Th texture of this is lovely, it feels great on my skin and I love the SPF 50. For the price, this cannot be beat, my new go to!

Okay so excuse my face in this picture because i was almost inconsolable at how hilarious this picture made me feel while taking it. So obviously this stuff isn’t for every day wear, simply because it leaves this white cast & it does NOT go away. But I will say that it has 100% served it’s purpose in moisturizing my lips & helping with the dark spots left after me constantly biting the skin off of my lips. I recommend buying this if you’re working from home & don’t have too many places to go right now that will cause you to be in public, OR if you’re like me & just don’t care if people look at you crazy lol. Either way, I’m happy with my purchase & what this product has done for my lips.

As someone with contact dermatitis, fragrance-free Vanicream products have changed my life. But their lip protectant is my least favorite product in the line. Note that this is a lotion-like cream, not a traditional baum; it does moisten and protect against the sun (SPF 30), it's long-lasting even in water (up to 80 minutes), and its active ingredients are all elemental, nature-derived inclusions (Zinc Oxide, Dimethicone, and Titanium Dioxide). Yet be forewarned that it dispenses as white (not clear), and that whiteness doesn't dissipate over time.  I ultimately find it too conspicuous to wear in social environments. I do still apply it before swimming or doing yard work, and before bed on nights when I'm not concerned with aesthetics.  I'm Vanicream-loyal until the end, and I'll continue to use this one situationally. But in social environments when I need simple, transparent lip lubrication, I'll still use a clear balm. - Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking "Helpful." Cheers!

Vanicream SPF 50+ has been a staple in our house for years. While it has been gone for a little while, this new formula is amazing and worth the wait! It has everything you want in a sunscreen, full mineral protection, and super easy to apply and spread. This product has none of the crap that you don’t want such as chemical sunscreens that can harm the planet, and other skin irritants. As someone who has struggled with sensitive skin my whole life, the Vanicream brand has been a lifesaver.

eos-eos

My son has extremely sensitive skin and I have (literally) tried every sensitive skin formulation out there on him. They all caused contact dermatitis. Well, I am SO relieved to report that this sunscreen doesn’t cause irritation on his face!! I am so beyond thankful!! For the record, Vanicream’s new facial lotion is also the only lotion he can use, so our household is a diehard Vanicream family.

This is the best SPF lip product I've used. Others have had either an off-flavor or unnecessary fragrance. This just feels just like plain Aquaphor pretty much. I find it helps my lips stay moisturized and there's zero fragrance or flavor.  I personally don't mind the white cast on my fair skin color. It kind of looks just like light lip gloss. This could be different for different skin tones, so just be aware that the white cast does not go away! I included a photo for reference.

eos-eos

I received this today, so my experience so far is very limited. I will try to remember to update after some more use.  However, I can say I'm so far very happy with the lip sunscreen. True to its claim, the product has no smell or taste-activating side effects, even when licking my lips (for science!). These two factors were the biggest selling points for me, as other sunscreen lip protectans leave horrible chemical tastes in my mouth and have a burning sensation.  It does leave a white cast, like other physical sunscreens I've used, but it dries down to be less noticeable after 5-10 minutes. I have very pigmented lips, so I can still see it. After having it on for 10 minutes, I put lipstick over with no ill-effect on application. As another test, I also "stamped" a tiny bit of lipstick on my lips before applying the lip cream, and they mixed very well with none of the white cast and a hint of color. I'm not sure if this affects how protective the product ends up being, but it's still probably better than nothing. This is what I'll do day to day, or I'll apply lip color straight over for other occasions.  I work outside in all kinds of elements and dirt for portions of my job, and I hate the feeling of chapped/sunburned lips. I'm a recent convert to a more robust day-to-day sunscreen regimen (thanks to a dermatologist on YouTube), and I'm glad she recommended this Vanicream as a solid option.  At the end of writing this review, and the cream feels very good on my lips: soft lips, not sticky, and no taste or smell still. A+ product

eos-eos

Takes a couple weeks but it works. It heals chapped and cracked lips. I have a nasty habit of biting off the dead skin on my lips when it's dry like this. Putting it on at bedtime does wonders, heals it overnight so I don't have that dead skin anymore to bite. The dimethicone in it is highly recommended for doctors for healing chapped lips which is why I tried it.

eos-eos

I am really religious about sunscreen application and this is great. It takes a while to spread but personally I prefer that as I tend to get slightly suspicious when a sunscreen is too watery and "easy" to get clear. Personally I adore the finish but for some it might feel a little too moisturizing (personally I *love* it). I have tried, and find this better than, the majority of Korean sunscreens (have tried too many to list tbh lmao, I'm Korean), DRMTLGY, ALTRUIST, La Roche Posay

eos-eos

UPDATE 5/29 - I started using a retinol a couple of weeks ago and I have found this sunscreen provides me with enough moisture (and sun protection) that I am no longer having to apply an additional moisturizer during the day; and I have very dry skin. I highly recommend this product.  ORIGINAL POST - I have been looking for a sunscreen for years that protects me from the sun, but also does not burn my eyes, cause skin irritation, or leave me looking pasty white. This sunscreen is it and at an affordable price! I will definitely be purchasing this, again.

eos-eos

Found this sunscreen perfect for my skin! Protected well, but does have a bit of an initial white cast.. I find I am able to fix for the most part by letting dry for a few seconds/minute and rubbing around again (am of light olive complexion). Would caution for everyday wear if of a medium to dark skin tone. Nonetheless, Vanicream remains unmatched in product quality and brand ethics. If not for you their basic blue lid tub of moisturizing cream is incredible.

eos-eos

I am 60+, with normal-ish skin type. Recently tried this and love it! Hardly noticeable cast on my light-medium skin tone, not greasy just moisturizing. I'm very happy I found it.

eos-eos

I love that this has no flavor, the "whiteness" disappears quickly and I cannot tell it is there. Give it time to absorb, these types of products do not use chemicals so they do not absorb as quickly as conventional products. Like most sunscreens, you should be waiting 15mins before sun exposure, which is more than enough time for this to turn clear.

eos-eos

This cream feels AMAZING but is super WHITE - like, you can’t be seen in public with this but maybe at the beach etc. Incredibly moisturizing so as another reviewer said, just use at home for extra lip care. You could use a bit and blot it and then cover with a lip gloss or stain?

eos-eos

Okay so I’ll start off by saying that I agree with all the reviews talking about the whiteness of this stuff. People aren’t kidding when they say it goes on WHITE. And there’s nothing you can really do about it, the less you put on the better it is as for not “looking so bad”… but you’ll see it on your lips to some degree regardless…. But let’s talk about the quality of this stuff and how well it works. It’s awesome. I am an avid tanner and started getting bad cold sores/heat blisters on my lips. I got this stuff and would just put a decent amount on before I’d get into the tanning bed and I haven’t had an issue since!! The white color has never bothered me because I just use it in the tanning bed then rub it right off with a towel before I leave the tanning salon so it doesn’t matter what color it is. But I can also see why people who need to wear it out in public would not find it as appealing. As far as how it works though, It works great. If you can get past the fact it turns your lips white and looks like you put literal sunscreen from the bottle on your lips, this stuff is awesome. You won’t regret it.

eos-eos

Leaves a bit of a white cast as most mineral sunscreens do so I didn’t take a star off for that. I’ve been using Supergoop sunscreen for a while and I love it but dont love the high price. I will say this formula feels thicker than supergoop and takes a little work to get it blended into the skin. This sunscreen is affordable and the zinc oxide doesn’t irritate my perioral dermatitis. I will def be purchasing again!

eos-eos

After about 10 years of using the same chapstick, I developed an allergy to it 3 years ago. I’ve done everything to find an SPF chapstick for my newly sensitive lips - gone to the dermatologist, allergist, etc., tried every cream recommended to me (aquaphor lip, Vaseline lip, Burt’s bees, Paula’s choice, etc.) - every single one caused an allergic reaction of huge puffy, red lips and small blisters all over my mouth. The only thing that’s ever worked for me is plain aquaphor (not the lip therapy) but it doesn’t have SPF and I live in Florida. I was hesitant to try this as my allergic reaction is painful and takes about 2 weeks to fully heal if I do break out. But let me just say, this is the ONLY lip protectant with SPF that hasn’t caused an allergic reaction in all the things I’ve tried over the past 3 years. I’m so thankful I can be in the sun again!! Now, as others mentioned, the cream is a little thick and very white. I’m completely fine with it after all I’ve been through! But here’s what I’ve learned - a little goes a long way (this helps the whiteness) and I put a little aquaphor on my lips before and then the vanicream over the top. This helped it blend a bit easier and color corrected a bit. I never write reviews but I’m hoping this could help someone that’s in the same spot as I was!! Worth every penny!!

eos-eos

My first application wasn't a great experience. It came on too thick and the white cast was ghastly. It wasn't until I took the time to apply this like a foundation. I started off with my forehead, then worked the product on the high points of my cheeks, sweeping the remnants unto my nose. I don't bring it down too far down due to my beard and mustache, but I've had no sensitivity issues applying some on to my eyelids and undereye area. A little on both ears and on my neck, and we're good to go! I recommend getting a chemical sunscreen if you just want a quick application. Otherwise, please take the time in applying physical sunscreens correctly.

eos-eos

I don’t really have a way of “testing” the sun protection so I can’t vouch for it. What I can say is that this is one of the best brands that is most often recommended by dermatologists. They know what they’re doing, so when they put spf 30 on something, you know for a fact that you are getting spf 30 out of this.  This stuff is expensive (obviously) clocking in at ten bucks for a tube of lip protectant, but it is worth it for me personally. This was surprisingly moisturizing, rich, and creamy for a liquid chapstick on top of defending your lips from the sun. I was amazed that even after rubbing it off so I could eat and drink, my lips felt softer even than after I use my moisturizing cream at night. I am utterly sold on everything this incredible product does. It -  -Delivers intense moisture -smooths your lips -protects from harmful sun damage.

eos-eos

Very happy with this purchase. I am a huge Vanicream fan and had to try out their new 50+ sunscreen. I trust the brand and use many of their products daily. I love that this is a mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide based), doesn't clog pores and is water resistant. After using it many days in the sun, the protection is wonderful. Thank you Vanicream for taking care of all my daily skin needs!

eos-eos

I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and I've had melanoma so I need to be wearing a mineral based sunscreen like this Vanicream SPF50+. This new formula is AWESOME! It's way better than the previous formula, which I also used, and it rubs in well without leaving a white film on the skin. I also do not feel greasy after applying. I use this on my face and on my body - highly recommend!

eos-eos

This goes on very white, so you have to spread it around. What I did discover is that it acts as a make up primer. My makeup slides on easily over it and tones down the whiteness. It really seems to hide the minor wrinkles and soften the look of the lines. I didn't expect that !

eos-eos

Goes on the lips feeling really nice and moisturizing, love that it is completely free of any fragrance, smell, or taste. I like that it is suited for sensitive skin, and can be used on the skin around corners of the lips as well to prevent dark outer lip corners.  However, my lips are naturally pretty red and pigmented, and this makes them look very ashy if I apply a generous amount to get adequate protection. So I’ll be using this when I’m working out outside, when I’m home alone, or if I’m wearing lipstick over this. It would be really nice if Vanicream offered a mauvey tinted version to combat the cast.  Despite the aesthetics, I’m giving this 5 stars because this is the first oxybenzone-free SPF lip balm I’ve found that is completely free of smell/taste AND provides reliable UVA protection.

eos-eos

I use other Vanicream products and decided to give their sunscreen a go. I have olive-medium tan skin, as well as moderate rosacea in my cheeks. This sunscreen spread does have a white cast while applying, but it absorbed and wasn't noticeable after a few minutes. It does leave your skin a little dewy, but not shiny. No real scent and didn't bother my sensitive skin at all, so overall very pleased. Typical good quality like most Vanicream products.

eos-eos

In my quest to be more healthy and get away from chemical sunscreens, I have tried MANY natural mineral sunscreens. They have not been so great due to bad odors, questionable ingredients, and hard to spread, not to mention many bad sunburns. Finally those days are over! This product was easy to apply and protected me during a week-long beach vacation, even after swimming and sweating! I rarely had to re-apply and I burn easily. It leaves a shiny (not matte) finish and I didn't look like a ghost. Highly recommended!

eos-eos

This product is great!! Customer for life now! It goes on easily and although it is white (physical sunblock), it blends nicely and makes your lips have a pearly sheen to them. Only suggestion I have is a design one, wish when you unscrewed the cap that the hole where product comes out would face down. Basically put the Vanicream label on the other side of the tube so that you can read the name of the product, unscrew top, and not have to flip tube over to use.

eos-eos

Sheer, dries transparent and non drying. Made in USA. I use this product line for all my skin and hair care products. Moderate price, not the cheapest but very good for fragrance sensitive people and good moisturizers in all the products without being tacky or gummy

eos-eos

I love love love this sunblock. I am a dark skin Black woman. I have extremely sensitive skin and wanted a sunscreen that didn’t clog my pores. I began using obagi face wash and this sunblock and my skin has not had a breakout. Very minimal white cast.

eos-eos

I love this product. I live in Florida so I def need sun protection. This works well to moisturize and protect my lips from any sun irritation or burns. Super moisturizing and I feel like the staying power is very good. One thing that I do think is VERY Important to note for anyone with darker skin tones/lips is that this can make your lips look super pale. I would def encourage anyone with lighter lips to use this. For anyone with darker lips perhaps put this on UNDER your lipstick for protection. It does work well for protection.

eos-eos

Better then regular chapstick!!!! Non-irritating, smooth, NOT sticky or not overly thick like Vaseline, doesn’t leave a bad taste, doesn’t dry out your lips making you feel like needing to reapply 100xs a day. Will leave a light white cast depending on how much you put on. Personally didn’t bother me but that will depend on your personal preference as well as natural lip color too. BEST lip beauty product that I wish I learned about years ago! Highly recommend!!!

I went 10 days for a surf summer camp in CA, very strong sun, salted water, etc. Super easy to spread, good sensation/taste when spreading, efficient against the sun and for my super sensitive skin.

So far I like this sunscreen very much. It spreads on well. It doesn’t sting my super sensitive skin or make my eyes water as so many others have. It feels light and not greasy. What a relief to finally find a sunscreen I can use.

I really like the smooth texture of this sun protectant lip-balm. It does leave a slight white cast which looks almost pearlescent. If I'm feeling washed out, I go over it with my tinted lip balm or lipstick. It dispenses out of a squeeze tube with an angled tip. When it's covered, the cap actually plugs the hole so that the balm doesn't leak out and make a mess. I don't like it quite as much as the Elta MD UV lip-balm, but it's half the price, so this is my go-to.  I feel like I get good sun protection and lip moisture with safe ingredients at a reasonable price. This gets a 1 from the Environmental Working Group (lower numbers are deemed safer). Recommended. I would repurchase.

eos-eos

Honestly the only sunscreen my skin can handle! I’ve been breaking out in hives on my face for the entire summer. I’ve tried every zinc oxide sunscreen out there. This one is the only one that doesn’t make my face itchy. It’s thick and takes a while to rub in so be cognizant of that, but really great stuff for horribly sensitive skin!!

eos-eos

I bought this to protect my lips from the sun, since skin cancers run in my family.  I have been wearing this lip protectant around the house to make sure it won't irritate my lips, as I have recently developed a sensitivity to most lipsticks and lip balms. This stuff feels great, and doesn't dry my lips out! There is no real taste or smell to it, which I like. It does go on white if you put it on REALLY thick, but it actually looks good if applied lightly.  I will be so happy to have this on hand once I can get outdoors to do my landscaping and garden work! UV protection is so important. ❤️

eos-eos

This is a good SPF lip balm. My only "complaint" is that it changes the color of your lips, which can look weird on some people. In the morning before I've eaten and my lips are still pale you would never see a difference, but when I've eaten and my lips are bright pink/red it looks soooooo strange haha. I like Coppertone's clear lip balm a bit better. But this one doesn't give you that weird SPF taste in your mouth unless you lick your lips a lot, so I'll keep using this!

eos-eos

I've tried numerous mineral sun products. THIS does the trick. Mineral skin care products tend to be drying. This is great as far as keeping my 54 year old skin hydrated. I wouldn't reccomend this to a 20 something, keep in mind your hydration level. LOVE THIS!

I am in a new sunnier location, this sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist after a skin cancer issue.

Every sunscreen I tried caused me to break out. This one was recommended by my dermatologist. I have used it several times with no skin problems.

I love to use this lip protectant in the summer especially. It leaves an initial white cast but rubs in 95%. Good enough for me and worth it to get a pretty high SPF. I tend to get bumpy rashes on my lips from many lip products, but do not with this one.

eos-eos

really protects your lips, not only from the sun in the summer - but also in the cold winter - prevents wind-burn & chapping as well. I also use it to coat/cover my tattoo in the summer, so it doesn't fade. If you put it on thick enough on your lips, they will appear white.... but it still protects with a thinner 'coat'. highly recommend!

eos-eos

I have sensitive skin and needed an SPF lip balm for the summer. This was recommended through an app I use due to my large amount of skin allergies. I haven't had any irritation or issue with this product. Goes on smooth and when used while boating didn't have any issue with burning. Only complaint is if you put too much on your lips are very white just like with sunscreen.

eos-eos

I was sad when Vanicream discontinued their last 50+ sunscreen but it was most definitely worth the wait for this new formula. It applies to the skin a lot nicer and more even. Thanks again Vanicream for a wonderful high quality product!

I am subject to getting fever blisters when in the sun whether it is hot or cold outside. This has prevented me from getting blisters and works well. It goes on white so I can see wear it is, unlike clear Chapstick. This is my 2nd time purchasing this and I will continue to buy it.

eos-eos

Pros: Great sun protection, water resistant, Hawaii friendly, nice packaging, great for sensitive skin, and not greasy.  Cons: Unsightly white cast, not hydrating, and hard to spread.  I heard about this product from Dr Dray on YouTube. All in all a great lip SPF, and when combined with another mineral SPF, it makes the cast on the face less noticeable. This is definitely not fashionable though, especially if you have darker skin. All in all a great SPF but not very hydrating.

eos-eos

This is my favorite lip sunscreen. It is very moisturizing and good for sensitive skin. It also has no metallic taste like many lip sun screams tend to have. It leaves your lips a bit light pink, so just be mindful of how much you’re putting on

I really like this sunscreen. I play tennis 3 times a week under the hot and bright sun. It keeps my skin hydrated and protected. I couldn't find any in the stores (Backlogged), so I was excited to see Amazon had it.

eos-eos

I have very dry lips and constantly apply every kind of treatment on the market. Even though Vanicream is a sunblock, and I use it in the daytime as part of my skincare routine, I also use it in the evening or on days when I'm not in the sun. It softens and hydrates my lips beautifully. I love it so much, I ordered it on a subscription-basis. Great product and I never want to run out.  Caveat: If you have a deep complexion, this product leaves a distinctive white cast. It does fade (on me, though I'm pale/medium), but it may not work for everyone.

Does not leave your skin looking ashy. Is not greasy. It's perfect.

Have been waiting awhile for this to be available again. It's the only sunscreen that does not make my skin bumpy and itchy.
