Protection for grandkids

Ordered again as we’ve had good results in the past.

I like that I control what is protected. I wish it had an application head that did not require me to use my hands to spread the lotion like an underarm deodorant

The sunscreen has an offensive scent. I don't know why makers insist on making suncreens that smell like a woman's boudoir. I prefer unscented sunscreens and sunblocks.

This Coppertone sport sunscreen is excellent for outdoor activities where you’re sweating more. I feel like even after going in water you can still feel it on your skin, although I’d still reapply after going swimming (says water resistant up to 80mins). Rubs in well and didn’t leave any white residue as long as you rub it in completely. It will make your skin slightly shiny after application. Didn’t irritate my skin and is one of my favorites for outdoor sports use.

My family likes to go to the beach. We need a sunscreen that resists water, sand, and sweat. The Coppertone Sport works excellent for us. This has a high SPF 70 rating. It’s marginally better than SPF 50. You don’t have to use SPF 70 if it costs you more.

My husband prefers this for outdoor work.

For a single person or even a couple the twin pack is a lot of sunscreen, but it has a 2 year shelf life so it's good for a couple seasons of use. Didn't notice any issues applying it and after 14 hours of use in a day for vacation I didn't notice any reactions or issues with my skin. Over all a decent sunscreen that will help prevent UV exposure and sunburns.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion spreads on my skin easily. I am very pale and live in FL. Sometimes when on the beach I feel as if I might combust. Jim, my husband, used to not have a problem, but he's on medication that makes him prone to burning easier.  I really like the coppertone lotion. It provided good coverage, no burning for him or me. We do reapply, probably the number one thing that causes burns is forgetting to put more on. My skin didn't feel gross or dry after using it. Very good
