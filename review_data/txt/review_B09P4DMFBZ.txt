totally functional sunscreen. It's not overly greasy, absolutely protects you and doesn't break the bank like some fancier stuff does. It was the same price as the SPF 50- so why not get the more SPF sunscreen - tho the difference is marginal at best so if this is more expensive than the 50 go with that.

I went to the beach and used this sunscreen. I’m actually taking accutane and warned me about being very sensitive to the sun rays (which I am). However, this sunscreen really helped. I really felt that relief as soon as I put it on and reapplied every 2 hrs.

I really like this sunscreen becuase it has a high SPF rating and is very easy to spread.

My husband prefers this for outdoor work.

The sunscreen has an offensive scent. I don't know why makers insist on making suncreens that smell like a woman's boudoir. I prefer unscented sunscreens and sunblocks.

Ordered again as we’ve had good results in the past.

Siento que no me protege como debería, quizás es muy líquido, no lo sé, la protección no es buena.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen 4-in-1 Performance keeps your skin protected from the sun's harsh rays. There are two 7 fl oz bottles in each order. The bottles have a built in grip on both sides which is very helpful when you are dispensing the sunscreen. The SPF 70 sunscreen is rich and creamy and glided onto my skin effortlessly. There is a faint stickiness initially and once it absorbs that feeling disappears. I could feel the sunscreen on my skin but it was very faint. The sunscreen resists sweat, heat, and water. I found when wearing it during a workout, the water and sweat would bead up on my skin but I didn't feel the sunblock sweating out. No stinging eyes is something I really appreciate. It's the sunscreen brand I grew up using but now is an updated version that works fantastically. The manufacturer notes that this product is able to stop up to 99% UV Rays. As with most sunscreens, the manufacturer notes to apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure, reapply after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating or at least every 2 hours. The product is free of Octinoxate, PABA, Phthalates, and Dyes. It has an expiration date of more than 2 years from the date I received it. I am really impressed with the sunscreen and knowing my skin will be safe from the sun.

California gets a lot of sunshine. If you don't want your skin to look like leather, you need to wear some sunblock. Coppertone has been a great brand over the years and I needed some for a weekend camping trip at the lake. This comes with two 7.0. fl oz bottles - so you can keep one in the car and one around the house. The sunscreen comes out white and is applied directly to you skin. As it contacts your skin it turns clears. It is a lotion so it does go on a little greasy, but after awhile it's fine. I was in direct and indirect sun (and wind too) for about 4.5 hours each day on the weekend and no sunburn. The nice thing is that even though I was hiking and doing moderate activities, I didn't notice the sunscreen. In the past the pores on my skin would get blocked and cause extra sweat. That didn't happen with this Coppertone Sport. So overall I've been pretty happy with this sunscreen.

I started using this sunscreen as the summer is coming. So compared to other sunscreens I have used in the past, this one is light and easy to apply. Spray types are always convenient, but those are not as effective as lotion and does not last long. Speaking of effectiveness, this one is the king, which held well with all the sweat from my hour long running, and my skin did not turn red. I saw no white streak of mess after my run, and I could tell the sunscreen held well on my skin. These sunscreen also has the traditional Coppertone scent, which I like. I do not rate on the price, but the $8 per lotion is typical although local stores sometimes have a dollar off coupon attached to many of these type of seasonal products. Overall, this sunscreen is a must have item this summer, and the sunscreen works great as expected.

My husband is in the sun year round ice fishing, hiking, and in the summer doing outdoor activities. He burns pretty easily and always needs to have sunscreen with him. He has been using Coppertone for years and it has worked for him beautifully. This one in SPF 70 is not very greasy or thick and dries quickly. It stops sunburns' even with the sun reflecting off the ice right onto his face. There is no harsh scent and he has had no breakouts or irritation from the product even on his face. The sun protection is high which is what he needs. The price for two bottle is very fair. What my husband likes most is that it doesn't sweat off when he is active. It stays put, no dripping, no unprotected patches. For him, it works very well and he will continue using the brand and this level of SPF.

Review for: Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion, Broad Spectrum SPF 70 Sunscreen Multi Pack, 7 Fl Oz, Pack of 2  I've been a fan of this brand/SPF for years. I go out biking several times a day in the hot California sun at temps upwards of 100F. I take a bot of this and put it in smaller bottles and keep the base bottle in my car to refill. I put another bottle in my backpack. My skin is near ginger level of able to burn so I need 50-70 for protection.  I think this is a great set for it's SPF and value vs. picking it up at the local store. As far as ingredients, I won't be so bold as to know anything about them, and I'll just trust they're OK.  I haven't burned EVER when using this nor has it ever worn off for me but I'm not using it for swimming.

My wife had Melanoma and ever since we've been persistent on using a high SPF sunscreen. This is a great option.  We've always used sunscreen but having Melanoma, it puts a newfound importance on using it. This sunscreen works pretty good. We've used this in the past and have had no issues with it. It spreads on nicely and lasts quite a while.  Overall, this 2 pack is well worth the money. I know money can be an issue when buying a product, but this product is worth every penny. Not to mention, it's hard to put a price on your health. I highly recommend this sunscreen. It's a trusted brand that's been protecting my family for years.

If you want a rock solid sunscreen, this is a great choice at SPF 70. It seems like a pretty standard Coppertone product that I've used for year and years and years.  It squeezes out of the tube very easily. It rubs in easily. It has the regular faint Coppertone sunscreen scent I'm used to. It kept me from tanning or burning after a few hours out on the bike trails working out at a moderate pace working up a moderate scent.  There's not much more to say about this. It's a very good product at a reasonable price. It works well and at SPF 70 it provides about as much protection as you might want or need.

I tried using the sprays, but personally I find them almost worthless. Being fair skinned, I usually buy the SPF 50 and still get a little red.  This is the first time I've purchased the SPF 70. The consistency is the same, but provides much better protection. It goes on smooth and blends in well. It doesn't have an overbearing scent like the sprays that tend to fill the room.  Coppertone is a trusted brand that I have used for many years, and now that I've tried this version, I'm sticking with it.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion spreads on my skin easily. I am very pale and live in FL. Sometimes when on the beach I feel as if I might combust. Jim, my husband, used to not have a problem, but he's on medication that makes him prone to burning easier.  I really like the coppertone lotion. It provided good coverage, no burning for him or me. We do reapply, probably the number one thing that causes burns is forgetting to put more on. My skin didn't feel gross or dry after using it. Very good

This Coppertone sport sunscreen is excellent for outdoor activities where you’re sweating more. I feel like even after going in water you can still feel it on your skin, although I’d still reapply after going swimming (says water resistant up to 80mins). Rubs in well and didn’t leave any white residue as long as you rub it in completely. It will make your skin slightly shiny after application. Didn’t irritate my skin and is one of my favorites for outdoor sports use.

Coppertone is a brand we are confident in. We are always happy with the quality and effectiveness of their products. We really like this sunscreen. It has a nice lite feel to it. It hasclassic Coppertone scent.  Our family is mixed. A couple of us tan well and a few of us are super fair and burn with the slightest interaction with the son  We are working really hard to only use mineral-based sunscreens, but I have to admit that I'm super confused by this product. It says it is "4-in-1" performance but number three of the "4-in-1" is "free of Oxybenzone..." but when I look at the ingredients one of them is clearly "Oxybenzone 6%".  Overall very happy with the "Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion, Broad Spectrum SPF 70 Sunscreen Multi Pack, 7 Fl Oz, Pack of 2" as a product but I have to give it 1-stars when there is clearly a discrepancy in the advertising and the ingredients. The product is great when used in environments where there is no risk of it harming sea life (Volleyball tournaments in the desert anyone?) but ambiguity around where it might be used to harm sea life isn't cool.

I really like this Coppertone Sport sunscreen. The SPF 70 rating is good for someone with fair skin like me and provides long-lasting protection. The best thing about it for me, however, is how easy it is to apply. It is not a heavy dense paste that takes a long time to get on and it doesn't leave visible residue. Instead it has a pretty thin consistency and rubs in very easy, leaving no white film. It has a light pleasant scent too. Great protection that's super easy to use.

We have a pool and our daughter and her friends are in it constantly. We always need sun protection. Coppertone is a brand our family has trusted for decades. It goes on smoothly, absorbs well, smells good, and works well in sunburn protection. You don't need to much - it goes a long way so we're planning this to last us a while.  We give it five stars and recommend it without hesitation to anyone considering it.

Love that this came in a 3 pack!! This has been my families go to sunscreen lotion since I was a kid. Applies thick but works into skin well for even the harshes sun exposure. We live in Hawaii and this has worked great every time. Just as every other sunscreen, you should reapply if using for water activity but for the most part, it lasts a really long time. I’d recommend 100 times over

Living in Florida I’m always looking for good sunblock that offers protection for a long time. This Coppertone 70 SPF is amazing. Smells good, goes on smoothly and isn’t really hard to rub in and it is water/sweat resistant. This high spf is needed to protect your skin especially you have someone that burns quickly. We found our new favorite sunblock. Definitely recommend!

For a single person or even a couple the twin pack is a lot of sunscreen, but it has a 2 year shelf life so it's good for a couple seasons of use. Didn't notice any issues applying it and after 14 hours of use in a day for vacation I didn't notice any reactions or issues with my skin. Over all a decent sunscreen that will help prevent UV exposure and sunburns.

eos-eos

Its so important to take care of your skin and i have always trusted this brand to keep my damage free. As a florida girl there is simply no escaping the sun but having protection like this doesnt make it too scary. On beach days i lather up real good and reapply every hour for excellent coverage and to avoid the dreaded sunburn. Great for daily use too! Dries clear!

This sunscreen protects well for a relatively long time. SPF 70 is a really high rating and that plays out in the results you get from wearing it. The application experience is pretty typical for a sunscreen; the stuff isn't exactly pleasant but it beats getting a sunburn!

My family likes to go to the beach. We need a sunscreen that resists water, sand, and sweat. The Coppertone Sport works excellent for us. This has a high SPF 70 rating. It’s marginally better than SPF 50. You don’t have to use SPF 70 if it costs you more.

My husband loves this sunscreen for running, since it stays put over 6+ miles in hot weather. Here's what he likes/dislikes:  1. Stays on. Doesn't run or rub off easily over his longer runs. 2. Protects as expected 3. Has a slight fragrance/smell. I can smell the sunscreen on him from several feet away, before he goes on his runs. Anyone who's sensitive to fragrances may hate this. 4. Is really hard to remove. All that protection comes at a cost - in this case, he has to rub with a wash cloth for a while to get all the sunscreen off. Even then, I've seen smears of it on towels hours later (it turns a yellow color on white towels, but it washes out okay).  All that said, he'll keep using it because it's better than any others he's tried.

The 2 pack comes with 2 plastic squeeze bottles each containing 7 ounces of sunscreen. This one is formulated for active use with SPF 70 (blocks out 99% of UV rays) and is active for up to 80 minutes when used in the water. The lotion is also free of oxybenzone, octinoxate, PABA & dyes. All told its a workhorse product and will hold up all day at the beach with a couple of reapplications here and there.

I like this brand and coverage for the kids. Twin pack will keep them good for several months

I like that I control what is protected. I wish it had an application head that did not require me to use my hands to spread the lotion like an underarm deodorant

Used to use Coppertone many years ago, thought I'd try it again since we've been having a very hot and sunny Summer so far. It has a nice light scent but it's greasy. Seemed to work though, I'm not badly burned from being outside in high heat and sunshine. Next time would prefer a drier sunscreen.
