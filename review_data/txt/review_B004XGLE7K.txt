I purchased this product and several other sun bum product specifically for our vacation to Hawaii -knowing the rules requiring reef safe sunscreen there. We hadn’t been on the beach two minutes when a representative from a reef protection society pounced us to tell us that this product was actually not reef safe as advertised. They practically slapped the bottle out of our hands. I did some research on the ingredients and found that this product has not just one but several banned chemicals in it. I’m disappointed that sun bum would advertise this as reef friendly when it is not.

I LOVE this sunscreen! My family uses the SPF 30 aerosol so this is what my opinion is based on. We've also tried the cream, but I prefer the aerosol because it's simpler to use on children and easier to dispense just what you need and be able to rub it in well.  Pros: - Good for sensitive skin (especially those with eczema) - Won't break out acne prone skin - Has been great to use on my baby and my face - No burns! Seems to be decently waterproof - Smells like coconut - Eco-friendly ingredients  Cons: - Have purchased with broken sprays multiple times before and have had to exchange, I would buy the lotion bottle if you need it ASAP for a vacation or something, just to be safe.

I started buying this last summer along with the sun bum face stick. I hate sunscreen but I hate getting burned probably about as much. I really hate smelling like sunscreen and feeling like a grease ball dreading the fact that my face is probably going to break out. While this is on the upper end of what I really want to spend on sunscreen I can't help but buy it because I honestly want to wear it. It actually smells amazing. While it's still got a hint of "that's probably sunscreen" it doesn't choke everyone out with "yep, that's sunscreen". It smells a bit like something you ought mix with a bit of rum and enjoy by the beach. With this and the face stick I'm willing to put it on before I hit the sun and I've found I don't get burned! It's a great product for those of you like me who really don't like the process of sunscreen (or the smell) but know you want to have skin (and be cancer free) when you're older!

The entire Sun Bum line has been terrific, with this spray being the standout! Great coverage and beyond easy to apply. Once it was applied, I was exposed to intense sun in Cancun. After an entire week of application, I'm happy to report that I did not burn once. Wish I brought two cans to Mexico. Excellent product!

I would say this is a good sun screen. It comes out clear so you can’t see it on your skin. If you are putting some on your face be careful. I accidentally got some in my mouth and it tasted like battery acid lol. I would put some in on your hands first and then on your face. I used this also on small children and it worked great.

I have a rare skin disorder that makes it almost impossible to order skin products online because not all of these products are honest about the ingredients in said product. I can say with certainty that this product is amazing for sensitive skin, it moisturized my skin and lasted all day. I got plenty of compliments from people saying that I smelt good today. All I had on today was this sunscreen. I work as a lifeguard and I am an aerial arts performer so I am constantly outside. This worked amazing with it's water resistance and longevity.

I have been using Sun Bum products for nearly 8 years. I really love that it's reef-friendly and has an amazing scent. The continuous spray bottle is convenient and we purchase a few whenever we go to tropical destinations. The company has so many different vegan-friendly options for skin protection, skincare, and hair care.

This is by far my favorite sunscreen. It’s the only thing that protected my VERY Irish skin in the Aruba sunshine on our last cruise, and I refuse to cruise without at least two cans. My fiancé and I SWEAR by Sunbum! I would literally recommend this sunscreen to anyone who wants to enjoy the sun, but not turn into a lobster! 10/10 is AWESOME!!

I love this sunscreen. I have two small kids - 5 and 7 - and I am always looking for sunscreen with no added chemical like phylalates, etc. I usually would be supergoop but it’s a bit pricey. I was recommended this brand by a friend and I love the ease of a spray sunscreen and the ingredients here. Plus, the price is great!

eos-eos

I brought this to the cabin for a weekend. Everyone used it there- for themselves, their kids, my kids... My son said he loved the smell (similar to other banana-y scented sunscreens). The price is steep on comparison to regular sunscreen, but with all the stuff in the news about cancer-causing sunscreen, when the can was empty at the end of the weekend, I felt good that the whole family was protected from the sun and other harmful chemicals. Makes this purchase worth it for sure!

eos-eos

I am fair skinned with sensitive skin. What a combo when heading out to enjoy the sun!! I've been using this sunscreen for years now and I absolutely love it. Keeps me from burning at the beach and also convenient to keep one in my golf bag when it's time to re-apply!

eos-eos

Lasts quite a while even when going in and out of of ocean! I still reapply after getting out even though it may not be necessary. Smells like a typical spray sunblock at first and maybe has a coconut ish scent once dry? Love it!

eos-eos

Bought this for our daughter to use at band camp. I guess it worked well as she didn't get sunburned. She used it daily (with frequent reapplications) for 2 weeks. We went through about 5 cans during that time as her friends liked her sunscreen better than theirs since it smelled kinda like coconut.

This product kept my pale and freckled skin pale and freckled after spending a week in Aruba, which is18 miles from the equator. I used the SPF 50 cream, SPF 50 spray, and the SPF 50 sun stick. I applied liberally and it worked. The scent is very nice and doesn’t have that overwhelming coconut smell like most sunscreen’s do.

eos-eos

Great for sensitive skin and pleasant scent. I like that this is reef safe for places like Hawaii that require it. This was great for my kids and no one had a reaction. Next time I will probably get SPF 50 though as I felt the sun protection on the 30 didn't last as long.

eos-eos

It doesn't matter if the sun hasn't risen yet or if it's raining, this is my favorite scent, I love it! It puts me in a better mood and I would also definitely recommend it for sun protection and convenience of use.

eos-eos

It sprays evenly, without any bursts of product landing where you didn't expect. It doesn't leave you greasy, the scent is very light and dissipates almost immediately so you're not left smelling like a coconut. I tried it out on a visit to Tucson in their hot sun it did an excellent job keeping me from burning.

I love this stuff but I was shocked when it ran out after the third time I was using. Either someone in my house was over using it or it was less than 1/4 full when I received it. Either way...I love this stuff but wanted to mention this in case someone else ran into this issue and I’ve never gone through one of these spray bottle so quickly.

eos-eos

Checked expiration and its good for a year and mist is very nice and applies smoothly, smells like coconut i love it! I don't usually get burns anyways but this stays on nicely without making skin too oily. Tanned one time for 30 min when this was still getting shipped to me and i can tell my skin is way less red after when i use this.

eos-eos

This stuff works - can is super convenient and sprays in any orientation, unlike some other sprays. The product itself works - spent three days at the beach in the sun and a couple of applications per day kept me from being burnt. Holds up pretty well in the water too. 10/10 would recommend.

ive been using this sunscreen on my face for a “revival” outside spray for awhile. my skin is dry, so it gives a dewy look on my soon after i spray. my skin is also sensitive and there has been no breakouts or irritation. not to mention- i love the smell.. reminds me of summer always

First time trying brand. I have sensitive skin, especially with new products. No issues at all. Great brand and highly recommend.

I love this sun bum sunscreen. I wasn't able to find it in stores at the time so I ordered it. It is so great and smells so good!

My favorite sunscreen. My son gets mad if I buy another brand because he loves the smell so much. The smell is delightful.

eos-eos

This is the best sunscreen out there in my personal opinion. The smell of vacation and tropical places is pristine. The application is easy and isn't oily or splotchy. I LOVE Sun bum and would recommend this to anyone looking for sun protection/delicious smelling sunscreen!

Non- greasy. Protective. No complaints. If this works for me, no need to look elsewhere.

This is going to be the ONLY sunscreen I buy for myself from here on out. It was amazing. Stayed in the sun at the Frio River for a week. Hardly one sunburn and it only took one application! Compared to other sunscreens everyone else was burnt putting on more than one coat of sunscreen.

eos-eos

This goes on so well. Not greasy or stinky. We all love the smell. It sprays on like a charm and dries pretty fast. Haven't been burned using it either. We usually reapply after about 90 mins to 2hrs of being in water. We love it!

eos-eos

This is my favorite sunscreen ever since discovering them back in 2016. I burn very easily and have not burned once since using Sun Bum. We buy SPF 30 in the can but have also used the lotion as well as the cool down lotion. All great high quality products from a company that understands the beach lifestyle!

Sun Bum is The Best!! All around. I have every spf for everyone in the family. From baby to butt white all the way to my tan son in laws!! Even use a bunch of their other products too!! It’s the best!

Barely let any sun thru! We were in Mexico for slightly less than a week, and came home about the same color as when we left, despite being in the sun every day! Non-greasy, and held up well in the salt and chlorine water even if we forgot to reapply.

eos-eos

LOVE this product. Sun Bum is my new favorite sunscreen. Yes it is a little more expensive but worth it. I am extremely fair skinned and burn super quickly. Not with Sun Bum. The continuous spray makes it super easy to apply. It hasn't clogged on me or gotten runny. Perfect consistency. Sunscreen also feels natural and not sticky. I will buy more.

I have been using this product for several years now for the main reason of how its not harmful to the interior or our boat. Has a nice smell and overall works pretty good.

We visit the Caribbean every year for several weeks. This is the ONLY sunscreen we buy and use. ALL the products they are offer are great!

This sunscreen smells like the perfect summer day at the beach and works well! Goes on easily and the spray valve works well. I've noticed other spray sunscreens are hard to press down one-handed sometimes. This one is not hard. It works wonderfully!

It does what it says it will and works just great. I sprays on sheer and provides great coverage for sun protection.

This is the only sunscreen I use. Took it to my dermatologist who raves about it. Protects me from getting burned yet let’s me tan slowly. Just moved to FL and I wear it all day long and haven’t burned yet. Smells like bananas and goes on evenly.

I LOVE this sunscreen! It protects me from the sun while I get tan. Apply and wait 10min before going in the water. It smells really nice too. I strongly recommend this product!

Love that it is easy to spray on and smells like sunscreen (coconut.)

I have no complaints about this product. It smells amazing, has no negative effects on my sensitive skin, and doesn't leave behind as much residue as other spray-on sunscreens I've used.

I have used this for 2 pool vacations with zero sunburns and I am very fair. I have eczema and it bothered it a little bit but everything does so I don't take points off for that. It has a nice summery smell! I've repurchased twice!

My son has super sensitive skin. This is the only product he can wear that will protect him and he will not dry out and have dry, red, cracked skin. Not one sunburn for this family this year! WIN!
