I'm a very fair, natural redhead with a mature (over 40), sensitive (product sensitive, sun-sensitive), extremely acne-prone, combination complexion. Combination-wise, I have the oily unwrinkled forehead of a 16-year-old with desert-parched cheeks. It can be challenging to find a sunscreen that isn't greasy, something that doesn't leave a white or orange cast (when tinted), that is fragrance-free, and something that will keep my forehead matte while also hydrating my cheeks. I prefer mineral sunscreens to chemical ones. But again, one that doesn't leave a visible residue is challenging.  I'd been wanting to try out the EltaMD mineral sunscreens after a very popular and knowledgeable YT Texas dermatologist recommended it. For a 2oz bottle, it is a hint pricy, but absolutely worth it, given the benefits.  1. Broad-spectrum UVA, UVB 40-SPF coverage. 2. Mineral-based 3. Tinted but does not leave an orange cast on my pale skin. 4. Well formulated so it also does not leave a white cast on skin. If you are curious as to the tinted vs non-tinted version, I included an image of the two side by side (no filter). The tint may look dark, but it blends in subtly the way a BB cream would, sheer, and is not caky or obvious. Instead, it gives me a healthy-looking glow. 5. Keep my complexion balanced. I can't say how this wears under makeup as I only tend to wear tinted bb creams or tinted SPF like this. 6. It is fragrance-free! Seriously, what is up with skincare makers' penchant for adding fragrance to products? Some of us are really sensitive to it. 7. Light-weight. 8. Not sticky or greasy. 9. Convenient pump. You won't spill or have sunscreen seeping into your bag when you take this with you. 10. A little goes a long way. About 3 pumps of this will cover my entire face, neck, and ear area.

I'm obsessed with skincare. I habitually use sunscreen, prescription retinoids, and Botox every 2.5 months. This is perfect for my morning moisturizer. I use the tinted. It occasionally leaves a shiny area, but always balances moisture levels and evens my complexion just enough that I use no concealer undereye and only on obvious breakouts. This is my complete daytime skincare in one step. At night I use Revision DEJ Eye Cream and a prescription retinoid followed by a bland moisturizer. People tell me I appear 29 - let's see if I can keep that until I'm 40. Here's to trying...

This, along with the non tinted version are absolutely amazing. For starters, I have rosacea and have dry, very sensitive/reactive skin. This blends in like a dream, with just the right amount of color to even me out a bit. Does it hide my red cheeks? No, but it does tone it down fairly well. The non tinted version has the slightest cast to it, and I am on the fair side. Still nothing compared to other mineral sunscreens. Both paired with a moisturizer before application gives you a beautiful glow to the skin. If you have normal/oily skin I think you could skip the moisturizer and just apply the sunscreen. Neither product has flared my rosacea, and my skin is actually calming down and looking much better. I would highly recommend both!

I have super-dehydrated, flakey tretinoin irritated winter skin. I was using Korean chemical sunscreen but after a rash, I decided to return to Zinc Oxide. The search has been endless. Nothing felt good on my skin or looked even close to acceptable. While this is quite tinted, it matches my skin tone well (fair/medium, neutral undertone). It's a little thicker than I'd like, but once it's on I don't feel it at all. The best part is that it's hydrating and it doesn't sting my eyes or sit on my dry patches. I wear it on top of my regular moisturizer.

I have normal to dry skin and I bought it especially for my face. No scent. It is light, blends well, and does not leave a white sheen. Does not feel greasy or sticky. Does not cause dryness or dry patches as long as the skin has been exfoliated and moisturized. The tint works well on fair to medium skin tone. Evens out discolorations nicely. I found that it doubles well as a makeup primer and even a light makeup base. I have loved everything about this sunscreen. Especially since it plays nice under makeup. (May settle into a bit into lines and wrinkles under makeup, but a little extra moisture cream fixes that.) Be sure to let it completely dry before makeup. The one minus is that while it was kind to my complexion and neck, it gave my chest a rash. Otherwise, it is the best sunscreen that I've found so far.

Guys, I'm orange. My face color is light, and this SPF makes me look orange. I am so upset. I was really excited for this product, it feels nice on my skin. I got up and looked in the mirror and nearly jumped. It has been about 45 minutes since I applied it to, I was hoping it would correct itself over time - NOPE, still orange. Im so disappointed! I will have to mix this with a non-tinted SPF to get rid of the orange tint.

The media could not be loaded. I dont usuallly write a review cause i am lazy but this one just worth the review really. It is so good!!!!! 100%

My derm recommended elta (mineral sunscreen). I‚Äôve tried a few of the elta products. I love the tinted options. My favorite is the elta elements which is water resistant and maybe a little better for gym days when I sweat. This one I‚Äôm trying because it‚Äôs geared toward anti-aging‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 49. Feels very similar to the elta elements, but this one has a slightly warmer tone. It works very well for me since I have olive skin, but if you have pink undertones, try elements instead. As for coverage, it‚Äôs sheer. It is not concealer or foundation. You can wear foundation over this. But for days when I wear minimal makeup, this feels so nice and natural. Then I add a little blush and mascara, a lip gloss and voila. I reapply throughout the day. Keep in mind this is tinted so be near a sink or have wipes handy for your hands. Reminder, this is not water proof or resistant (like elements). Lastly, I just want to add that chemical sunscreen stings my eyes. Even if not near my eyes, if I sweat and the sweat gets in my eyes, OUCH! I‚Äôve had no issues with any of the elta sunscreens. No scent. No sunscreen smell. Nice! I‚Äôve worn Elta for years and it‚Äôs my go to.

Tint: I'm in fair to medium skin tone range and the tint matches my skin very well. It has a natural finish but it is on the shiny side for me. I have normal skin and my face perspires a fair amount so it may not be shiny on drier skin. I use a solid cream foundation in a compact (which includes a physical sunscreen) to touch up through the day if it's not practical to just add on more of the Restore product or if I need to tone down the shine. I do see some improvement in my brown and red spots since I started using Restore a couple of months ago. I use a prescription hydroquinone product so that helps with the brown spots but it seems to cause/aggravate red spots. The Restore does seem to even out my complexion somewhat and does not dry my skin. I also use the ELTA 41 tinted. It is a lighter tint than Restore and provides more coverage for me, at least. The 41 lasts longer without touching up. No shine, but it's not really matte, either. I switch them out depending on what I'm doing that day. I only use physical sunblock on my face, which can be drying and irritating. Cycling in the Restore some days is keeping my skin "happier". I don't perceive any scent from Restore. I have somewhat sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes but I have no problems using Restore. I love ELTA products.

I am so disappointment. This product neither hydrates your skin nor leaves a matte effect. It just sits on top of your skin making you look oily and greasy all day long. Considering the price point I was expecting a better product/finish. Also, each time I apply this sunscreen I feel a tingling sensation. I am returning it.

eos-eos

I‚Äôm 47 with sensitive skin. I stopped wearing foundation and just wear this. It‚Äôs last longer than foundation, protects you from the sun and has no scent.

I can't say enough good things about this. It's tinted but blends right in to whatever your skin color is, 100% mineral, and and has the consistency of a thicker foundation but again, it shows up like you are wearing nothing. Compared to the UV Clear (which I also love), the Restore is slightly thicker and almost a TINY bit greasy when you're putting it on, but once it dries it's completely invisible. I also noticed the UV Clear would pill if I put too much on, but so far, the Restore has never pilled on me. I recommend this to everyone!

LOVE this spf! Elta md tinted spf 46 has been a favorite but the Restore has just the slightest yellow tint instead of pinkish which matches my Hawaiian/Korean/Caucasian skin tone perfectly. Slightly silkier than the Elta md tinted spf 46 tooüëçüèº

This product does go on a little greasy, but absorbs nicely and doesn‚Äôt look too shiny nor too matte. Doesn‚Äôt provide much coverage, but does even out the skin a bit and is almost invisible. I can see how someone with extremely fair skin or cool tone skin can look a little orange or yellow, but I think it will be almost invisible on most. No smell or residue.

I found this through a YouTube video aimed at older women. I am down here in South Florida and the heat and humidity are setting records relatively early in the summer. This sunscreen is light and works well under foundation and blocks sun exposure on when worn alone. It's a repeat buy product for me.

eos-eos

I am Not allowed to be out in the sun, new thing‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm out in the sun all the time, so I use this on my face and neck, and although no one is around when I‚Äôm gardening, I look pretty darn good if someone pulled upüòÇü§£üòÅ

For a day to day product I love the way it looks and feels. It gives great coverage, but if I‚Äôm going out for a hot day in the sun this sweats off pretty quickly- I would suggest something else.

eos-eos

I love how it goes on so smoothly. I can hardly see the tint and it doesn‚Äôt feel like I have any on my face. I will definitely buy this again.

Love the product but the pump doesn‚Äôt work. I needed it and don‚Äôt have time to return it so I‚Äôm just squeezing a little out of the tube when I need it. It‚Äôs difficult to get the amount you need. Hope this was just a fluke.

I use a heavier foundation and mix it with this tinted sunscreen -- it provides for a little more coverage during the day, but keeps the foundation from being applied too thick. I've used this for several years and love it.

I love thugs sunscreen. It makes me want to keep wearing it even inside. I‚Äôve been wearing it everyday and my face has a lot less freckles than I expected. I‚Äôm in the sun pretty much everyday for the last three months.

My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me and I'm glad she did. It is nicely tinted and goes on smooth with no flaking or white areas. No irritation to my face has occurred.

Love Elta MD products and this is my favorite one. I find it a little dark for my very fair coloring so I mix it with the Restore non-tinted but I like the smell of the tinted much better.

I like it a lot. It‚Äôs not drying and smells good. The tint is a little dark for winter but perfect with a summer tan.

Initally tried this as samples from the dermatologist. Its a lightweight non greasy moisturizer with sunscreen and the tint us perfect for no makeup days. Fast and essy to apply snd reduces mild blemishes. Easy to use dispenser. I love it and highly recommend it!

This may work for some people, but for me it is too orange. I have been using another tinted Elta MD product for years and the color of that one was much better, the overall tint was more subtle. This photo shows shows my older product, Elta UV physical Broad spectrum SPF 41, on the left, and this product on the right. They are very different. I can't say how it works yet because I'm not sure I want to put this color on my face.

Light weight and loved the added sun protection on my face. Will buy again.

The dispensing is the most annoying. If it falls over in my bag it doesn‚Äôt like to come out again without pumping and pumping and then it will squirt right past whatever surface (my fingertips or makeup sponge) that I‚Äôm trying to aim at. Coverage is ok It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòmust have‚Äô love of use for me

I am a PA (Physician Assistant) in Dermatology and while I have liked EltaMD in the past, I have experienced separation with 3 different products of theirs. The first one I received as gift from the EltaMD rep that visited our office. She couldn‚Äôt explain why it happened. My last bottle of the Restore was fine so I ordered 2 more and I‚Äôm sorely disappointed at the separation of the product, it comes out watery. It happened on my first few pumps and then again a few weeks later to BOTH bottles I ordered. See photos. They must need to work on the formulation, but I can‚Äôt recommend this to my patients anymore, especially at near $40/bottle.

Although this brand is widely recommended by dermatologist, it definitely irritated my skin. It was not obvious at first, but after I wore it for a couple of days a row, I started noticing a lot of redness and flaking, and my skin started feeling really dry. It also accentuated fine lines, probably due to the dryness and irritation.  I stopped using it for a while and the problem went away, then I tried it again and it came back so it was definitely this product. I thought maybe I could use it on the back of my hands instead of my face so it would not go to waste but that does not work either because it definitely looks like make up when you put it on your hands!  I did like the way the product looked on my face. I was hoping to use it as a foundation substitute; it was working well for that with the exception of the irritation.

eos-eos

It's a tinted screen, can be used for blue light protection if you are using a computer for a long time. It feels like a foundation, so you don't have to put on the foundation if you use this screen. Just a little disadvantage, it will smear your white-collar if you put it on your neck.

eos-eos

The restore is the perfect combination of anti-aging, moisturizing, and sun coverage. I use it daily and will be repurchasing it again. It goes on light, makes my skin feel soft and the tint blends very well. My skin is extremely sensitive and not only do I tolerate it, my skin loves it. This is a yes. If this does not work for you, EltaMD has different styles of coverage that could work for you.

I‚Äôve tried probably 6 different tinted mineral sunscreens (3 from EltaMD). This was, by far, the best one. It‚Äôs tinted but doesn‚Äôt leave you looking orange. No white cast at all, unscented, And it goes great under make up. It‚Äôs not drying but it also doesn‚Äôt make your face greasy. Little pricey but worth it!
