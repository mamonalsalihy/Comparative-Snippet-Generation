Excellent sunscreen. Rubs on without leaving my skin feeling greasy. Luxurious smell. Strong and even sun protection. Wonderful!

My sister in Hawaii turned me on to sun bum because it’s safe for the reefs in Hawaii. Once I used it, I loved the smell AND it works great. I even use it in my face and I don’t break out. I’ll never purchase another sunscreen. I’m a sun bum lover for life!!

Given all of the controversy as of late over the quality, effectiveness and healthiness of sunscreen products I wanted something highly effective and safe, environmentally friendly and reasonably priced. I tried numerous products and none did as well for me as Sun Bum.

Works great! The scent is nice, doesn’t sting eyes, and it’s an ingredient list you can feel good about. My only feedback is the texture feels a little thick and it is a noticeable feeling on face (not body). Either way, I’m very happy with this purchase for value, ingredient list, and efficacy. Would highly recommend if you need a good family use sunscreen.

Purchased for husband who has issues with cancer spots on his face and head. He has used sunscreen for years but obviously it didn’t help. Just purchased and hope it works.

Most sunscreens i have worn in the past are super greasy but Sun Bum is the complete opposite. I have super sensitive skin and i put this on my face and had no issues. No oil residue, no white cast, and it doesn’t turn white when you get in water. Even wearing sunscreen i was able to get a tan without burning. I’ve ordered 3 bottles since my first purchase and will probably never use another type of sunscreen

Great sunscreen. We swear by this stuff in the summer by the pool. It lasts a while too. I feel like other brands you can go through 1 in a month. This lasts us a long time with everyone using it.

Soooo I have super sensitive skin and most sunscreen still allows a burn. I initially bought the 50 spf, but it wasn't enough! The 75 spf goes on smooth and easy + it protects me from a burn! It also smells delicious

Smells nice enough to lick. Came on time.  I hope they don't mess this up it's one of my favorite summer things.

This is one of the family’s favorite sunscreens. It goes on well, smells great, and works well.

I found my new favorite sunscreen! Smells great, doesn’t feel thick and greasy... stays put and drumroll please.... it works! We rode motorcycle from AZ to SD and no sunburn! Also rode from AZ to CA enjoyed the beach and still no sunburn!

I have very fair skin, so I burn easily. I was recently at a resort in the sun and came home the fair skinned person that I was before my trip. To me this is the first sunblock that has accomplished that and it keeps your skin moist and does not irritate.

eos-eos

Was told about this and after trying it, I will never use another brand. This stuff rocks! A little pricey but well worth it

eos-eos

Love this sunblock and the coconut smell. It doesn’t feel super thick. You do need to reapply after a couple Hours but it’s gotta be way healthier for your kids!!

eos-eos

literally the only sunscreen ever that actually protects my skin and lets me have a tan instead of a burn i love it, and a bonus is it smells like bananas !! :D

eos-eos

never leave home without it on, does not leave me greasy when applied.

This sunscreen WORKS! I've used many a sunscreen in my day, with having fair skin, and have found that I either: A. need to constantly reapply, (we're talking 30 minutes or less) or B. suffer an instant burn. Neither apply to this product, I find that it rubs in well, smells great, and protects me from the sun. What more could you want?

eos-eos

This is the best sunscreen. I did not burn at all and I was in the sun for 6 hours.

Like the smell and trust the product. Worked great.

Sun Bum 70 protected my granddaughter from burning at the beach while undergoing chemo. It’s the ONLY sunscreen we feel comfortable using for our long days at the beach

I just love the smell. Feeling and protection.

Sun protection. Stage 2 melanoma survivor. Important to have good sun protection all the time.

Great smell and even better protection. We will in FL and the kiddos are always outside so it’s a relief to find a reliable product like this that completely prevents sunburn.

Love the smell and leaves my skin feeling good like Lotion (dose not leave my skin feeling sticky)

I love this stuff. I surf all summer long and haven't been burned once using it. It's thick and smells like the classic kind of sunscreen. I love it.

Strong sun screen, plus it works as a moisturizer. One of the only sunscreens that doesn't make my wife break out.
