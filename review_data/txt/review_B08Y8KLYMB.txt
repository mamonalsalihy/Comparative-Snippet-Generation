I typically love Blue Lizard products, however this was a miss for me. I did not realize this is a spray lotion. I buy spray so that someone doesn’t have to physically rub lotion on my back.

The product works, just not with my skin, I noticed it caused my face to break out in little white cysts, idk what that was about but it was rapid, and went away within a couple weeks. Make sure you wash it off thoroughly

This was so thick and heavy all I did was sweat it off. Great sun protection if you can keep it on.

I bought this spray thinking it would have the same consistency as some of the other spray sunscreens out there. This is one of the most difficult to apply and rub in. It goes on like white spray paint, and it is frustratingly difficult to rub in and spread over skin. It takes me twice as long to apply this on my daughter than the regular lotion version. I wouldn’t purchase this version again.

Did not work at all, we all got horrible burns even after applying every 30 minutes

To recap from a review I agree with:  1) does not absorb well or quickly into the skin even with small amount at a time 2) does not have a pleasant smell and a bit challenging to rub and massage into skin 3) feels a bit greasy 4) after being in the water, the white film is still showing and the only way it will come off will be when you shower and scrub well 5) It may protect you from UV rays and sunburn but there are better and likable products that will do the same for a lot less. 6) will not buy again 7) I suggest Australian Gold Spray sunscreen SPF 50. It works and the spray is clear.

We are blue lizard fans, but we will never buy this spray again! My son claims that it stings when it goes on his skin, it did not appear to stay at all on my daughter’s slighlty damp skin, and when I applied it, the bees and wasps in Florida wanted to attack me. I am going back to the lotion!

We really wanted to like this sunscreen but every time we tried to use it no matter how little we sprayed on we could never get it to absorb and rub in. Left you looking white as a ghost anywhere you had put it. I don’t know if the bottle we received was defective or not but it wasn’t returnable so it went in the trashcan.

Product required a lot of rubbing in, still left white streaks on my skin. I felt itchy all day and got a rash on my upper chest/neck area.

I bought this because I always heard wonderful things about the brand … idk if it was because we used the spray can one but I put some on my children at the beach and that afternoon my youngest had BUBBLED Blisters all over her face . We all were so burnt after continuously applying every hour. I will stick with think baby sunscreen and deal with how thick it is because never in my life have I got so burned and my child have bubbles on her face . Maybe the lotion is completely different but I learned my lesson .
