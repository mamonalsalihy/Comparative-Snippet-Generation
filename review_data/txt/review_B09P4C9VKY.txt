Good coverage for hours and not sticky

My husband is a distance runner who had skin cancer a few years back. He is now VERY serious about his sunscreen. But even among "sport" varieties, he struggles to find a brand that provides long-lasting, sweat resistant protection. He was hesitant to try this because super high SPF usually means thick and sticky. But after his first run with this product, he came back and couldn't stop talking about how great it was.  It is a bit thicker than most sprays, maybe, but he always rubs it in anyway, to ensure even coverage. He liked how quickly it soaked in. Mostly, though, I think he was impressed by the longevity of this product, given how much he sweats.  Because he likes this so much, I was glad to see we can order it again through Subscribe & Save. Current price through that program is $20.37. For 3 cans, that is the best price around!  Coppertone has been a go-to for us for many years, but this may be a new fav. Highly recommend!

The most important thing about sunscreen is that you don't get burned. This stuff does the job and does it well. I have light skin that burns pretty easily. When I spray it on a few minutes before getting in the pool on hot sunny days, I have never been burned. The spray works well and provides a good spread- it's easy to self-apply. I hate the greasy feeling that lotions typically leave behind. While this does have a bit of that, I would say it's better than most. This is a staple for me for summer fun.

I usually get Coppertone big pack from Samâ€™s club in the summer time for my whole family. They usually do a very good job for sun protection. Plus, it is spray form, it makes it goes on body in a much easier way. I think the one I usually gets from samâ€™s is little different from this product. This has much functions as what it says. 4 in 1, protects from sun, heat, sweat and water. I always trust coopertone, I tried several other brandâ€™s sunscreen product, it usually irritated my skin and making me feel very uncomfortable and wanted to wash it off right away. Coopertone didnâ€™t do that to me, I have Coopertone baby, Cooppertone kid and now Coopertone adult sunscreen sprays all ready for this upcoming nasty Texas summer.

The media could not be loaded. Recently went on vacation and brought this with us to test out. I really like it! It comes out as a nice, light mist in a continuous spray, with just a slight fragrance that is almost floral. I applied it generously on each one of my family members, noticing how evenly it applied each time. It's not sticky or greasy and seems to last even while swimming in the pool. I didn't feel any of us got burned by the sun while wearing it, either (my husband did get a little color but nothing close to a burn). Would definitely order again!

The Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Spray is great for the upcoming summer months. It's easy to use and spray on evenly. To provide maximum protection, you'll need to gently rub it on to your skin. At 70 SPF, it's a little higher than most other sunscreens. The Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Spray also has a bit of water resistance that results in up to 80 minutes of protection even if you're playing in the water. I tend to reapply every 2 hours or so (I know that's over the 80 minutes) if I'm spending a long day at the beach or attending a picnic.

My least favorite thing about applying sunscreen is getting my hands oily after applying it. The spray style works wonders to not only putting on sunscreen quickly but also making it easy or handy to travel with. I've got one almost everywhere - in my golf bag, hiking backpack, trunk and in front of my door for when I'm about to head out. Also helps that Coppertone's sunscreen just works better than everyone elses.

This sprays well and goes on clear, so no white residue to worry about. Itâ€™s not a wide spray, unless you hold it a little bit away, in which case you better not have any wind as it flies away ðŸ˜…. Good coverage and no irritation from any family members. The only thing is after several uses, some clear oily sunblock did stay on the nozzle and I picked it out in case it becomes blocked eventually.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen 4-in-1 Performance Spray keeps your skin protected from the sun's harsh rays while keeping your hands clean with an effortless spray. There are three 5.5 oz bottles included in each order. The spray dispenser has a useful twist lid that prevents the spray from accidentally being sprayed while in a bag. The spray bottle dispenses the SPF 70 sunscreen with an even and wide coverage. There is a faint stickiness and shine initially but it absorbs quickly. I could feel the sunscreen on my skin but it was very faint. The sunscreen resists sweat, heat, and water. I found when wearing it during a workout, the water and sweat would bead up on my skin or sit on top of my skin but I didn't feel the sunscreen sweating out. It's the sunscreen brand I grew up using but now is an updated version that works fantastically. The manufacturer notes that this product is able to stop up to 99% UV Rays. As with most sunscreens, the manufacturer notes to reapply after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating or at least every 2 hours. The product is free of Octinoxate, PABA, Phthalates, and Dyes. It has an expiration date of more than 2 years from the date I received it. I am really impressed with the sunscreen and will be using it daily to keep my skin protected.

I have used this brand for years and this is good quality. It's easy to spray on and spread around on the skin as needed. I like that it absorbs into the skin quickly. 70 SPF protection seems to be the sweet spot for me since I have fair skin. While I use lotion sunscreen for the face, the spray sunscreen is much faster to apply to the whole body.

This sunscreen dries quickly and the skins absorbs it fast leaving no white marks. The 3 bottles provide a very good portion to use throughout summer and it provides very good protection against the sun.

I have to be careful of spray on sunscreen products. This brand I have used in the past without any issues. Have both the SPF 50 and 70 in this one. I tend to spray it on my hands and rub it in more than directly spraying it on. Does not cause any irritation to my skin which is a huge plus for me. Will on occasion spray on my legs if I can get the spray to be fast and light enough. I like that this one does not dry out my skin or leave it feeling greasy. Gives me good protection for when I am out in my garden for hours on end.

This sunscreen is very easy to apply.  In my experience, it has lasted several hours at the pool without my grandbabies getting sunburned. It does not seem to wash off easily at the pool. It has also worked well when hiking.  At 70 spf, the protection is pretty good for most people.  Recommended!

When companies make products they need to be aware that I have a very soft and sensitive body especially when it comes to skin care products. Iâ€™m especially careful about buying sunscreen that you spray on to your skin because sometimes they can stick on my skin and itâ€™s just unpleasant. I definitely feel like it protects my skin from UV rays, but it is a sticky and tacky feeling that lasts for hours.

Package comes in 3 bottles, these are good supplies for the upcoming summer season and also ideal for the South California all year round dry weather, the heat becomes really unbearable. My son uses it whenever heâ€™s spending most of his time playing basketball and skateboarding in the park, great skin protection.

This is a perfect sunscreen spray for outdoor sports. High SFP protection and water resistant. My only concern is that not sure if it is reef friendly. Overall, great product, great value for money as well.
