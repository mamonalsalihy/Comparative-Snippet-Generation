I have 49 year old dry skin and Disciod Skin Lupus (an autoimune disorder that causes disfiguring red and flakey rashes on my face and ears/hairline). After 5 years of being on daily pills I decided to back that down. As DSL is photoreactive that means no UV to my body. Chemical sunscreens in the US degrade rather quickly so I've focused on mineral sunscreens for use under makeup. Wow. What a wreck. Even though I'm pretty fair most are a hot mess. Tinted. Untinted. Ugh. SO over them. I have 8 mineral only sunscreens in my 'using them up' bin. But then along came Elta MD 47. Nicely moisturizing and with some blending doesn't leave white cast on my pale face after a few minutes. I do find it dries down to leave a white cast on my arms and settles into my elbow creases because (I think) I just dont work it enough. I actually like the Coola SPF 30 tinted sunscreen as much but at twice the price for 1/3 the product I find that it's the Elta MD that I automatically grab and find myself wondering if it comes in a bulk size. And the sunscreen that you'll wear is the best. Elta MD 47 is it for me.

Of all the many sunblock products I've tried post-Moh's cancer skin surgery and plastic surgery for repairing the area, this is the easiest and most emollient to apply. Less paste-like and absorbable, and not as chalky in appearance. My dermatologist recommended and carries this, but was out so I happily bought it here on Amazon. It scores highly on the EWG sunscreen/block ratings.

I have VERY sensitive, fair, rosacea prone skin. I have used the Sport Elta SPF 50, which is about twice the price, but prefer this product much more.  It does take a couple of minutes for the white color of the zinc in this sunscreen to calm down (maybe more if you're darker skinned... I'm not sure) but once the white fades, I just sprinkle some mineral powder on top (La Bella Donna) and am good to go for the day.  I feel protected and because of the slightly thicker texture, you don't need to reapply for on-the-go use. (A day at the beach or in the water, yes of course reapply!)

This is the only brand of sunscreen I use. I had 2 melanomas removed and this brand was recommended by my doctor at MD Anderson, she uses it herself. I like the mineral sunscreens which is also preferred by my doctor, I have issues with chemical sunscreens, I break out all over so I have to use a mineral sunscreen. This particular one goes on smooth and does not make you look like Casper afterwards, it leaves no white cast on my face, neck and ears. Highly recommend this sunscreen.

I have tried ALOT of mineral sunscreens and this one is great for adult and kids. I prefer this on the body bc it gives a little bit of a white cast on my face but seems to blend in nicely on my body. It has that nice silicone feeling and spreads easily. Also no scent which is great! Highly recommend this!

My husband is allergic to the chemical blocks in most clear zincs, so we have a hard time finding a product that he can use and is not hard to apply and leave a white film. This product goes on easy, was easy enough to rub in, and was NOT greasy. I recommend this one and will buy again.

eos-eos

I confirmed with my doctor (and actually his nurse-wife) that this was the recommended mineral sunscreen. While it does leave a barely seeable white film on the skin, it is not greasy, and seems to do a good job of protection. Maybe not a whole-body solution due to cost, but great for face and arms always exposed.

eos-eos

It does take a LOT of rubbing to work this in til no white shows, but I managed to not get my paper-white skin burned while spending roughly 8 hours on a Bahamian beach, even after being in the water. It doesn't smell that strong, and I experienced no breakouts from this product.

Super super buen protector solar, lo super recomiendo xq es como una crema que suaviza la piel de los pequeños , el olor super suave.. en mi opinión es el mejor de todos los que les he comprado a mis hijos

I read up many positive and negative reviews before buying this product. I was looking for a light moisturizer, contains a high level of SPF, and that it would not compromise my makeup foundation. I risked and ordered it anyway. To be fair for the product maker and with a sense of integrity, I don't understand how someone could lie by writing bad reviews for this product. I used 3 (apple seed size) drops on my face, 3 drops on my neck and chest, 2 drops in each arm at a time. I gently rub it into my skin and for the record, it does NOT leave white filming or streaks. The initial whiteness does disappear once it's absorbed into your skin. I believe most people with negative reviews are using too large of the amount. I love how it just soaked into my skin, does not sting my eyes like other product with high SPF content. But most importantly, I love it because it is a non-greasy and sticky product. I love the smoothness on both of my arms. Great product for face, neck, and body. I highly recommend it.

I have been using this product for awhile. My doctor had recommended this item. I am very happy with it and use it everyday.

I bought this as a less expensive alternative to Rodan and Fields Soothe Mineral Sunscreen, and I love it. The active ingredients were a good match to those listed in the R&F version, and I have had equally good results. It really protects my face when outdoors for extended periods (beach, pool, Colorado River), and it does not cause break outs. Highly recommend!

eos-eos

The product absorbs well and protects well as I am allergic to ingredients of other sun screens, I am happy to have this to use. To use on parts of the body other than face it is necessary to allow it to be absorbed well or you will get white residue on clothing.

I use this sunscreen everyday. It’s perfect under makeup too since it doesn’t make your skin feel greasy. I love it.

Purchased for my mom. It’s her favorite sunscreen.

My new favorite sport sunscreen. I am a fan of EltaMD skin products--and this is no exception. If you take a minute or two to rub it in, it's not whitening. I don't use it on my face, though--I use the facial one. I love that it goes on easily and is good for a long time in the water. Great for boating and swimming.

eos-eos

I bought it because it is part zinc oxide and part titanium oxide. I read that using the combo is better than just using zinc oxide. I like that it goes on so smoothly and thus quickly. Dab it on my face every morning. Easy and smooth application is the key to encourage daily use.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is very easy to apply. It is neither greasy nor filmsy like many other sunscreens with zinc oxide.

I have been a EltaMD user for many years but was only recently introduced to the Pure Broad Spectrum line. This product is the only sunscreen I've found that can last for the duration of my long outdoor pursuits. At the end of an Ironman 140.6 I even have to scrub to remove the remaining sun screen (noting that I will take additional sun screen along the way when it is offered....). I'm very fair skinned so this has saved me many many days/weeks of painful burns as well as skin cancer in the future. Highly recommend.

I had a freckle on my lower eyelid that my ophthalmologist wanted to biopsy. Luckily, it wasn't skin cancer, but he reminded me how important it is to put sunscreen on eyelids as well as the face.  Of course, I know this, but finding a sunscreen that did not burn my eyes seemed impossible. I even watched YouTube videos put out by dermatologists and tried their recommendations, but after a few days of burning eyes and headaches, I gave up.  The downside of this sunscreen, however, is that is has a super white cast. It makes me look like Casper, the friendly ghost. So, I use this around my eyes. (Careful, a little goes a long way, and it comes out fast.) Then I use another moisturizing sunscreen that has less of a white cast on the rest of my face.  It sounds like a hassle, but not having a headache from stinging eyes makes it worth it.  I LOVE this sunscreen!  (PS My sister says Arbonne kid's sunscreen also does not burn the eyes, but I don't like to buy from MLMs. But I'll put it out there.)

My derm recommended this for a Florida Trip. It protected very well. I have had IPL treatment on my face and didn’t want the brown spots to return. Hours on the beach and swimming in the ocean- full sun block

So far so good with this mineral sunscreen!  I have have a photo-allergy with most chemical sunscreen ingredients, meaning once I step out into the sun, I develop a rash. The only sunscreen ingredients I can use without a reaction are Zinc and Titanium Dioxide. I have spend hundreds of dollars trying out different mineral sunscreen formulations, and have mostly been disappointed. I've never been burnt by one, but they ALL either are too hard to rub in, and/or leave a white/purple cast.  Until this sunscreen, I had been using Juice Beauty Sport, which I appreciate the high % of Zinc in, but was always too greasy and left just a bit too much white cast. So far I am very happy with this formula, its scent-free, not too greasy, mineral-only, and does not leave a white cast when you rub it in! The price is also great, considering most mineral sunscreens tend to be even more expensive than this one. Im glad it has a good EWG rating, and is on the recommended list, but I do wish it was zinc only rather than a combo with Titanium Dioxide. That is my only complaint, otherwise I'm happy!  **For reference, I have light olive-toned skin, so I am not sure how this would do on darker skin tones, but it doesn't seem to leave any sort of even subtle tint on my skin.

The only sunscreen that works! I am a triathlete always in the sun. this sunscreen holds up. I can apply in a.m. for my run and it still protects for my bike ride at lunch without reapplying.

My favorite sunscreen is Skinceuticals Physical Fusion but the smell, which is oddly reminiscent of gasoline, sometimes bothers me. So I decided to try this one since it's only about $20 for 4 ounces versus Skinceuticals Physical Fusion (tinted) or Sheer Physical (untinted) that are $34 for 1.7 fl. oz. It's very similar to the Sheer Physical, maybe a tad more whitening which is probably because it has a higher amount of zinc oxide (Skinceuticals has 5% and it's Z-Cote). The Elta is water resistant for 80 minutes, the Skinceuticals is only 40 minutes. Skinceuticals has Phenoxyethanol whereas Elta doesn't though both are free of parabens. Skinceuticals also has a plankton extract called artemia salina which, "increases skin defenses and resistance to UV and heat stress."  I use Clinique Take the Day Off Balm to remove this, it's pretty tenacious. My advice is to use something like the TTDO Balm or an oil cleanser to remove any sunscreen and/or makeup you wear to be sure you're really getting it all off.  Bottom line: This is a great sunscreen but nothing will take the place of my HG Skinceuticals but for the price difference it's almost as good. If you have rosacea and/or sensitive skin, give this one a shot.

Good

I lost count how many times I've ordered this sunblock. Put this one one is the last step of my morning skincare, I have to use this no matter my makeup has sunblock in it or not. It comes out white but becomes clear after I rub it on. It doesn't oxidize under makeup or bb/cc cream but does give a little shine after putting it on but a little set powder will fix that. I use double cleansing at the end of the day to make sure to remove all of this and all the makeup. I definitely continue to get this one unless elta md comes out another physical sunblock for oily skin :)

Reasonably priced and effective skin protection.

I have skin lupus and I have to avoid the sun. This stuff helps me lead a normal life. Because it provides a PHYSICAL barrier, it has protected me on the times when I have to go out in the sun and I've been fine. I still wear a hat and avoid the sun whenever possible, but it's impossible to avoid the sun altogether and this keeps me safe. I have been really happy with this product. I use this one for my body and another Elta MD for my face. I just got the lotion which moisturizes and provides SPF. Overall, I am super happy with this because it has the zinc-based physical protection unlike other sunscreens.

eos-eos

Works perfectly has a primer. Good protection. No nasty chemicals. Only need to use a small amount to cover your whole face. Makes your face look whiter but it doesn’t bother me. Doesn’t really have a scent which is a plus cause I hate the smell of sunscreen.

THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST BECAUSE I GET HORRIBLE SUN POISONING AND OTHER BLOCKS WERE NOT WORKING. I LOVE IT. ITS UNSCENTED WHICH IS GREAT. IT CAN BE A LITTLE WHITENING, BUT I DON'T CARE AS LONG AS IT DOES THE JOB...AND IT DOES.

My Dermatologist recommended this product and I am very happy with it. It did not burn my eyes or skin like other sunscreen products.

Recommended by friend who has had skin cancer and needs the best protection from the sun. I use it on my face and love it. Other products get into my eyes when I sweat - not Elta MD!

I use, and love, EltaMD Sport, but that is a mostly chemical sunscreen, so I was looking for an alternative. This is great for outdoor, sweaty, long day wear. It leaves a little more of a white cast than the other EltaMD sunscreens (the rest of the line leaves zero white cast), but it's not too bad. The great thing about this sunscreen is that it dries very fast, and stays put during activities. It's 10% zinc, so that's great protection. I wear it running and gardening, and my fair skin has never gotten a burn.

This is fantastic stuff. It works, doesn't make me break out, blends in, and isn't too greasy at all. I wear a light powder foundation over top and have no complaints.

Purchased this sunscreen because it was recommended by the dermatologist AND rated a #1 by the EWG. The ingredients are not harmful and it provides a physical barrier to harmful sun rays. I saved over $5 by purchasing on Amazon and received it promptly. Expiration date is 2017 - this is from a new supply. Elta Pure is NOT meant to be a daily moisturizer - it is an excellent sunscreen and will leave a slight white cast. I have an olive complexion and did NOT think it was ghost like. It was easy to rub in.. I used it to be out in the sun ALL afternoon and it provided excellent protection. Very pleased with this purchase!

This is the only thing my dermatologist wants me to wear. I have lupus with sun sensitivity. Regular sun screens--even with high SPF--just don't work for me. My dermatologist says this is a "physical block" as opposed to other sun screens. Yes, it makes my white skin look even whiter, so I can't imagine what dark-skinned people do with this. Sometimes I take some of my foundation and mix it in. Not sure if that's a no-no, but I only do it occasionally when I really don't want to look like a ghost.
