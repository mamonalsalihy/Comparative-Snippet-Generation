Beautiful glow. It even works with my fair skin.

This is perfect for my oily, aging skin. It doesn’t cause me to break out and I don’t feel it after I apply it. I didn’t cause a white cast on my skin tone (light medium to tan complexion depending on the season) . It is a pretty close dupe for the Tula Protect and Glow but doesn’t have all the extra skin care ingredients. This gives the same glow to the skin and they feel about the same. Neither pill on me and play well with other skin care, concealer and powders. I don’t wear foundation so I’m not sure how it would layer underneath that. This is my holy grail, and while I’m glad that other people aren’t snapping it up, this sunscreen deserves way more love. I will keep repurchasing this as my daily sunscreen as long as they keep making it.

I bought this because I got a free sample of Glowscreen and fell in love with it but didn’t want to cough up $40 for a full sized bottle. What I love about Glowscreen is its beautiful, non-oily or sticky shimmery dry down and that it leaves no white cast.  Some had suggested that this was an affordable dupe so I thought I’d try it. It’s not. This has a heavy sunscreen scent (which I enjoy) but is significantly more pale in color than the Amazon picture portrays; it left a white cast on my skin as well. The “glow” disappeared as soon as I rubbed it it. If you’re fair you might enjoy it but I can’t use it on my face which is what it’s intended for.

I am a dedicated Sun Bum user. I usually use the Sun Bum face stick when we go swimming, but I wanted something for everyday outdoor time. I would say an hour after application, my eyes started burning, SEVERELY. I had to wash Glow off my face.  I was also disappointed that the color was so mild. With a name like "Glow" I was expecting a healthy color or some shimmer. Nope. But it didn't give a white cast on my skin, so it's not a total fail.  That said, I didn't get sunburned. It didn't make my combination skin look greasy. It is easy to apply. There's no noticable scent. All good things.  Ultimately, there's no way I will be using the rest of this on my face. I like my eyes comfy.

Does great protecting my skin. Is a bit runny and not to sure about the glow part. But at least I wasn’t burnt. It did it’s true job

I have sensitive skin and this works great on not drying me out, doesn’t cause break outs, and is light weight. Will use all summer!
