Great protection

I have very sensitive skin. My complexion is very fair, i.e. sunburn and do not tan. This product worked great! Went on easily and evenly. Protected my skin for a day and a half at the lake with no sunburn. The down side was that it only lasted for 5 applications! The spray bottle arrived without a cap. I am wondering if the cap was missing and it wasn’t a full bottle.

Seems to work in terms of sun protection but I found that where I have sensitive skin it got bumpy and didn't feel great being sprayed on. Also, it's very greasy/oily. And it stays that way, it doesn't dry. There are other types of spray sunscreen that are far less expensive and a better product. I wouldn't purchase again.

This should get zero stars. Provided no protection whatsoever. I feel like my husband would have burned less without using this sunscreen. He applied before golfing and was outside in the morning through mid- afternoon.

A little oily for my liking. It does it's job though and didn't bother my skin.

Contains Octocrylene, should be removed from market

I applied this sunscreen 4 times in the span of 4 hours at the beach, never got wet and I’m so burnt. It’s like I didn’t even put any on at all. SO disappointed it literally provided no protection. Excuse me while I bath in Aloe.

This did nit cause a rash which is great, and was easy to apply not transferring to everything I touched. It just doesn’t work. I tried it three times. I got sunburned three times.

Goes on lightly and invisibly with no filmy, greasy feeling or odor. Sprays easily and you don’t have to rub it in. It was effective all day in direct sun on my very white, sensitive, easy to burn in 10 minutes skin. The fact that it worked so well and that I even forgot I had it on is worth the price in my book!

It’s fantastic
