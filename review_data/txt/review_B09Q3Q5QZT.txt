Great sunscreen crean, easy to spread, doesn't smudge clothes/ swiming suite, does't come of easily, after sweating, or in water.

Does not work. This was our go to brand but this does not work.

I use this stuff on my entire body, which is heavily tattooed. Spreads easily and works like a charm. Doesn't leave a white cast and protects all my ink. Highly recommend.

This set of Sport Sunscreen Lotion from Coppertone brand comes in two single packs and I think for the price, It's a very good deal and it's worth it as they are more pricey if you buy them individual from stores. The brand is popular and these sunscreen works great as it blends well on skin and have SPF 50 which is great for everyday use especially in summer or at beach.

We've always liked Coppertone sunscreen and the sport sunscreen is very durable. It blends easily and quickly, works very well, doesn't come off in the water, and is sweat-proof. I am very fair and this did the trick for about an hour and a half at the beach in the direct sun (before we left). The only thing is you really have to wash it well in the shower or it is very resistant to coming off.

We haven't hit full summer here yet, but I've been out gardening and hiking this spring after applying the sunscreen and haven't had any burn from the sun. The sunscreen lotion is easy to apply and doesn't run off when I sweat. Glad to have this for when the sun really heats up.

I like this Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion. The high SPF 50 is great for working outside, boating, beach days, and so much more. The lotion is thick yet easy to apply. I am a huge fan of the Coppertone brand and this product is no exception. Would order again.

We live on a lake, so we go through SPF quickly (especially in the summer). Coppertone is a trusted sun protection brand, this duo is a great deal! The bottles are easy to hold and dispense product. It's a higher SPF which is great. The scent isn't overbearing. My husband likes this over many others since the smell isn't "girly" in his words. It has a neutral scent.
