This was my first time purchasing from this company. I am currently in the Caribbean and use this product. It was great when going in the water. It did not wash off. It does not leave a white residue and it is a Reef safe. I would highly recommend!

We were looking for a daily SPF30 that would be easy to dispense, so we bought this large bottle of Rocky Mountain sunblock. It's a pleasure to use. Absorbs quickly. Not sticky at all. Seems 100% effective through 60 minutes in the pool and bright summer sun! Nice product, highly recommended. By the way, this large volume dispenser was near the least expensive SPF30 we considered buying. That's a plus, for sure!

My husband and I are avid outdoor adventurers. I discovered their sunscreen and have been using it for years. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't make my face break out. Also it stays on a long time so we have to apply it less frequently. It isn't greasy. It applies evenly. It doesn't feel like you have a coating on your skin. Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great sunscreen.

I am a practicing dermatologist (20+ years), and this is what I use myself. Light, non-greasy, and effective. A gallon lasts just about a year in our house.

We put it on all the children at daycamp.

This product used to be dimethicone/silicone-free so it let the skin breathe & didnâ€™t trap sweat...a major cause of rash from sunscreens. It was reformulated within the past few years & no longer lets the skin breathe. The newly added dimethicone/silicone slicking agents that help waterproof it, now cause rash issues for my family. So bummed...Rocky Mountain used to be our go-to formula to protect our skin while letting it breathe & avoiding neck rash.

We misplaced our sunscreen at home and used this product provided by our pool. The next day my 3 year old has a red rash where I applied it, especially on the shoulders, upper chest, and cheeks where it would not have washed off as much in the pool. We'll be sticking with zinc oxide from now on.
