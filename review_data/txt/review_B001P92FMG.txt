This product arrived damaged, even though there was no visible damage to the packaging box it came in. The sunblock is open at the top corner; sunblock is leaking out in big globs. I would like a refund or a replacement please.

Not greasy, very moisturizing and excellent sun protection for sports and everyday

It works very well and feels light on the skin. However, it looks and feels a bit too oily for my liking.

Was looking for a sunscreen that wasn't greasy and has a high SPF and this met both.

I wanted to love this, but after 10 minutes it started to flack off my skin. I wanted to return it but it’s a no return with amazon. I’ll try it without a moisturizer & see if that works.
