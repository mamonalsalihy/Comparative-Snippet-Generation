I’m a busy fair skinned lifeguard, so my job has exposed me to a fair amount of different types of SPFs. Asian sunscreens, expensive sunscreen, all kinds of chemical and mineral sunscreens you name it, but nothing has ever beat this stuff. After an 8hr shift, I still look the same as I did before it.  The finish is matte, not sticky, so my hair doesn’t stick to my face when the wind blows. It also doesn’t smell too strong or transfer onto anything. It holds up really well against sweat and doesn’t break down in the light so it lasts so much longer. In the winter, it’s thick enough to protect me from wind burn without being uncomfortable. My skin is dry, and my eyes sensitive, but this sunscreen doesn't give me any trouble. When it’s hot and I’m sweating a lot, I’ll re-apply about every hour, but regular conditions, I can get away with touching up every two to three. The two sun screens I always wear at work are “this” for my face, neck, and upper body, and the beach defense SPF 70 for my legs. I find that these two have the same strength but each have a different finish on the skin. Here’s a picture of me a few years ago on July 18th to show you how well this works for me! Keep in mind that my genetics play apart in this as well:)

Great sunblock. Feels good on my face and doesn’t cause me to break out. My husband and I own a CrossFit gym in Texas and have spent plenty of sunny 100+ degree days outside with clients and I’ve had no issues with sunburn. It also doesn’t run into my eyes when I sweat. I was concerned that this was a waste and my other sunbloc, would do just fine. However, You can really tell it’s designed for active use. Not to knock my other sunblock, but for active use... this takes the cake.  The downside, and honestly the trade off for its awesomeness, is that your face will be shiny. My husband told me to towel off, because he thought shine was from sweat. So it’s perfect for sports and poolside/ beach fun as promised, but wouldn’t use it for basic everyday use.

I'm a dermatologist who likes to run sprints as an exercise. I've tested a bunch of sunscreens because so many burn my eyes when I run. My eyes are quite forgiving with this sunscreen. That being said, I noticed a few other reviewers whose eyes have burned. In my opinion, they are probably just unlucky to be sensitive to this sunscreen. In short, some people will have eyes that burn and some won't. This applies for all sunscreens. You've got to find one that you tolerate. The same rationale applies for rashes or acne.  I recommend different sunscreens for different purposes. This one happens to be a little heavy for daily use but it does the job during exercise as well as any that I've tried. In case you're interested, I apply it ridiculously thick about 45 minutes before I go out. I look like a freak around the house but it gets absorbed by the time I step out the door. I recommend reapplying every two hours. For swimmers, reapply every 30 minutes if possible because "waterproof" laboratory testing is done in a bathtub. It's a lot different in the pool or the ocean.  On the technical side, "Helioplex" refers to photo-stabilization, which means that it resists breaking down when the sun hits it. Yes, you heard right--many sunscreens break down in sunlight!  One more word of advice not related to this sunscreen, so I can feel I'm honoring Hippocrates and his oath: Even the best sunscreens are not perfect in filtering or blocking ultraviolet light. So try to go out after 4 PM in the summer. Or, if you prefer, get out there at 6 AM and be back home by 9 AM. If you're a hiker, get a hat with wide rims from Sun Precautions or another company called Sunday Afternoons. They also sell shirts that block ultraviolet light and cool you off. I would post their websites but Amazon doesn't allow links on these reviews.  Last thing--- Like all dermatologists, I get a bunch of sunscreens for free from manufacturers. But I buy Neutrogena Sport Face with my own money for my workouts on the track.

eos-eos

Don't tell Neutrogena, okay? But, this product hosts the near exact same ingredients as their most more costly "anti-wrinkle \ anti-aging" cream. Plus, it does 70+ SPF which the other cream does not! Word of wisdom: DON'T get this stuff in your eye. It burns and irritates for hours. Yes, I know. We all want a cream when applied sucks all the fat packs from under our eyes. Yes, yes. Well, they don't have one. So, there is no point going too close to your eyes with this. Highly recommended and for me, prevents sunburn even walking 4 miles on the beach in full sun in Florida. Advice? Pack it on heavily eye-level and below, not above. Sweat can run it into your eyes. Better than all competitors.

Great product. Although I received a damaged one that had tuned yellow from Amazon, I've bought this product many times and when it's fresh (not expired) it's a great product, doesn't run, doesn't make you sweat, doesn't leave a cast, not too shiny. Just keep in mind when buying that the color and texture has to be like cold cream, not yellow cheesy. If you get a fresh item it's a great product at a great price. Better than Shiseido, Replenix or other "high end" products.

My partner has to be in the sun as a coach. He was so dark that the sunglasses left a permanent mask of white around his his eyes. (Reverse racoon eyes! Haha). He was afraid to use sunscreen due to his sensitive skin and sweat running lotion into his eyes. I forced him to try this telling him he's surely is susceptible to skin cancer and worth more to me alive. Now he uses this product and looks fair with no white mask. Maybe we were able to reduce the risk of skin cancer, just too late to prevent wrinkles. Hee hee. One recommendation is remove the sunscreen promptly. But regular soap is not so great at removing the lotion. He removes the sunscreen as soon as he gets home using Neutrogena makeup remover. The only negative is i have to buy twice the amount of my favorite makeup remover. Ugh.

eos-eos

I applied a good amount to my face and didn't wear any makeup. It left my skin smooth as if I had used a primer and not any more oily or shiny than it usually gets. It probably helped in that department. Kept my daughter from getting pink or brown on her face during tennis with an hour of direct sunlight. No irritation or blemishes on myself (30's), mother (60's), or daughter (8) from using. It came in an individually sealed plastic bag, as did Coppertone Ultra Guard Sunscreen, inside a brown bubble wrap mailer. Neither were open or leaking, but they didn't stay in mail carrier's truck or mailbox all day either. No separation of lotion and didn't require any shaking. I'm really impressed with the face product and am tempted to get some for the body. It is smaller, but $5.99 for it to be used just on face is reasonable.  June 21, 2019 Have two bottles from last year and they are still perfect in consistency and effectiveness. This is a keeper when it comes to sunblock for the face. Must have caught it at a deal last year because now it's $8.99.

Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face Oil-Free Lotion Sunscreen, Spf 70+, 2.5 Fl. Oz.  Our go to sunblock for face and neck and back of hands. Use for outdoor activities in Florida and travelling. Goes on easy, no smell or any irritation, lasts and seems to work very well and once it dries it is not that noticeable. Have not actually tested it after being in the water, works fine with normal sweat. Always have this in cars or sports bags. For arms and legs use a larger and cheaper product from Neutrogena that is also very good.

I was so glad to find this on Amazon. My local stores can't keep it in stock, and it's very hard to find. I am fair-skinned and have allergic reactions to the sun if I spend too much time in it, not to mention the sunburns and skin cancer risk. I need an effective sunscreen without added fragrance to irritate my respiratory conditions. This does what I need it to do. It doesn't feel greasy, doesn't clog my pores, doesn't give me respiratory distress, and does protect me from burns and allergic rashes.

eos-eos

I LOVE this sunblock! It does not irritate my sensitive skin, really blocks the sun's rays from my fair complexion, and keeps it plump and hydrated. It is not greasy or sticky, and doesn't clog my pores. My skin actually looks better since I've started using it. I apply it twice a day, as I work outside, and the 2 coats don't create a gross buildup. A much better sunblock than Neutrogena's "Clear Face," which burns my skin and is runny... dripping off my fingers as I try to apply it.

eos-eos

Great smooth lotion that stays on in the Florida Gulf waters and doesn't burn your eyes. I have used this on a fishing/sand bar week and a few days later on a scalloping week and I did not burn once. I did have to reapply after scalloping, but it lasted on me for about three hours of snorkeling. This lotion isn't super thick, but thick enough to stay put and not make you look like a ghost or translucent. This is my new go to lotion..love it!!!

eos-eos

I hike several days a week and live in the desert with little shade. This sunscreen works beautifully. It doesn’t clog my pores and it doesn’t feel greasy. The pictures from other reviewers stating they burned in the sun are just not accurate. It looks like they laid in the sun for HOURS and no sunscreen would prevent burns for that kind of activity. Laying in the sun like that is not healthy or safe, and sunscreen should be reapplied every hour. I am very happy with this product.

This is a tad personal but after years of cycling, motorcycle riding, and water sports I developed a brown patch on the end of my nose. Don't worry it's not a serious medical issue ... but I'm hoping that this cream will allow my biking without making it worse. Just got fingers crossed it does the trick. It does stay in place through nose blows, and the tube has a small hole so it's easy to treat a small area. We'll see how the brown spot behaves.

eos-eos

Saves face, literally. I have used this while working outdoors sweating like crazy and have not burned. I like the Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin as I have no problems with them. This lotion is absorbed quickly and is non-greasy. Can't even tell you have sunblock on. I mostly use it on my head and neck, and sometimes arms. It has not discolored my clothing. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs sun protection and has sensitive skin.

The sun, after all, is a deadly laser. Day in and day out, it fires high energy photons at our cells that can cause irritation and DNA damage. As this accumulates over time, we run into issues of skin spots, sun burns, and potentially skin cancer. Wouldn't it be super cool if there were a literal shield we could put on our skin that deflected them and absorbed all the UV light so our literal DNA doesn't have to? Put it like that and sun screen is a no brainer. But everyone has heard of sun screen, so why THIS sun screen in particular. Firstly, it doesn't make my skin oily, and it has actually helped it become smoother. I originally ordered this for the very high SPF, so that's just a bonus. Bottle has also lasted me a while, so it turned out to be very cheap so far. If you are looking for sunscreen that is powerful, doesn't make your skin shiny or white, and has the ability to absorb well and quickly, just buy it. Best sunscreen I've used on my face by far.

eos-eos

I got this because I started working on a farm recently and needed good sun protection. I also have acne, and didn't want to risk making it worse with a cheap sunscreen. This is exactly what I needed, it works really well and it doesn't make me break out like cheaper stuff does. I'll definitely be buying this for the rest of the summer.  Note: Please test this on a small patch of skin before putting it on your face! It works well for me, but people are sensitive to different things, and you Do Not want to risk having a reaction on your whole face the first time you use it.

eos-eos

I have a very fair complexion and i do need a very high sunscreen. Some products are super thick and as soon as you sweat the cream is a mess. This is just wonderful, it is absorbed in a few seconds and not too thick! I do have sensitive skin and never had any issues with it. I always recommend it especially to my fair skin friends.

eos-eos

Best sunscreen I have ever used with a price to match. Aptly named, it is best used on your face and head due to cost, and during sport or around water as it does stay on in wet environments better than most sunscreens. It is very thick and has to be rubbed on well to spread it around evenly. You can easily vary the thickness with which you put it on and that allows you let some sun in for a tan if desired. The reason I use it is because it does not clog pores so I don't get break outs from it like I do with Neutrogena's regular stuff. This product is often found at pharmacies at double the price listed here.

eos-eos

I tend to break out when I put sunscreen on my face. Even face formulas. Since I already use the Neutrogena moisturizer with SPF 15 with good results, I gave this one a chance.  I use it on top of the SPF moisturizer when I stay out for hours; it does not make me break out and has a decent staying power when I sweat. I reapply every couple hours and my nose does not get tanned (the horror! tinted nose abruptly ending at the sunglasses bridge!).  There's that faint white tint that physical sunscreens have, but I've had worse. I avoid the eye area so can't tell if it would sting.  P.S. I never ever review products on demand or get discounts from companies; this is my honest consumer opinion.

eos-eos

What I like most about this sunscreen is that it does blend in on the skin well and does not leave white marks on face or clothes. Some other brands can be challenging to work with and often make you look so pale after applying. This one does not. It stays on skin long enough for a game of tennis. It does help protect me from sunburn. I would say to reapply every 90 mins or so for best protection.

eos-eos

I bought this one because I have had basal cell cancer previously. This doesn't smell much and rubs in nicely (no white residual as with zinc formulations). I have fairly sensitive skin in general and have had no issues for the past two summers. Like any sunscreen, it still needs to be reapplied time to time but I have exercised outdoors in open California sunshine and I have had good protection. I purchased because it has ingredients that protect from both UV-A and UV-B without needing zinc oxide and have been to date impressed by the product.

This has been our go-to face sun screen for 3 years. It doesn’t bother eyes like many do. Great protection- no burns when we use it, and we spend much time outdoors at pool and beach.

eos-eos

Many sunscreens leave a heavy, greasy residue that becomes even more apparent when you sweat a little. They can leave your face feeling like you’ve got a heavy layer of grime on it.  This is stuff is the antidote to those problems, and is the lightest feeling sunscreen that I have ever used. I walk outside for work a lot, and I use this primarily for my face/head/neck/upper chest area. Even after 2-3 applications, it’s still pretty light, and is perfect for athletes, as it doesn’t seem to combine with sweat to create the gross layer of muck I spoke about above.  Great product. Been using it for 1.5 years, and will continue to do so.

I used this Neutrogena Sport Face Sunscreen on our recent Disneyland vacation in Southern California. It protected the whole family. I even used it on my infant's bald head and it protected her well. I didn't have any breakouts from this product either, a HUGE plus. I've use other "oil-free" products that had my chin breaking out like crazy. I absolutely recommend this product.

eos-eos

My favorite sunscreen by far. It smells good, rubs in easily without leaving white streaks, moisturizes my skin but doesn't make it greasy, oily, or sticky, and keeps my face from getting sunburned during long days on the water.  I use it year-round as a moisturizer because it works better than anything else I've tried, including various expensive skincare brands.

eos-eos

I am fair skinned and I sweat a lot when I exercise. This sunscreen has worked well for me during my biking and hiking activities. It has not made my skin greasy, absorbs well, and it seems to stay on even when I am sweating. Most importantly, no sunburn.

me gusta porque protege muy bien y de verdad es duradero. Por otro lado, a diferencia de otras referencias de la marca, éste no deja la cara absolutamente blanca todo el día. Eso no es estético, y me pasó mucho con 2 referencias adicionales de la misma marca que también compré. En este encontré el punto ideal, sí deja algo blanca la cara pero con el paso del tiempo se desvanece, y normalmente solo deja algo blancas mis cejas

I love this sunscreen for my runs! No matter how much I sweat it doesn’t get in my eyes! The coverage is great and it’s not greasy feeling either. I don’t buy anything else for running AND when I head to the beach for my face.

Consistent quality and protection. The thing I value about Neutrogena is that their formulation stays constant from year to year. Store brands vary depending on which vendor they choose for any given year so you are never sure the effectiveness of what you are buying. Sport Face delivers good relatively durable protection, without irritating my skin.

eos-eos

Works much better than the spray by Neutrogena. I work this on my face from 11:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. in direct sunlight and did not get burned. It is NOT greasy, nor did it leave a residue. It goes on white but isn’t too thick and the white rubs in. I would recommend!

I usually have allergies to certain sunscreens, but this one doesn't affect them. I also have acne and this hasn't made me break out. Being pale and burn easy I highly recommend this because my face doesn't have a single burn

I bought this for my husband who swims. He’s gets too much sun on his forehead from the reflection off the water. I said this or a cap. This Pandemic let me see his forehead with a natural color for the first time as pools and the beach we’re closed. So after laser treatment he’s got to wear a good sunblock and this is it. He liked it too. So that means he’ll use it.

eos-eos

I was skeptical because as a pale but naturally warm person who suffers through the east coast summer humidity each year I was used to being disappointed by products with similar claims. This one however totally won me over. No matter how much I sweat it doesn't run into my eyes and I don't have to worry about completely sweating my sunscreen off and hurting my skin. It doesn't hurt that this product won't break the bank either.

After looking so long for a sunscreen that is moistuzing, but doesn't leave me looking like a ghost; I can finally say I found the perfect product! Especially due to the fact that I have a darker complextion, this sunscreen works wonders. With a thin application process, I cannot leave my house without having this on my face. 100/10!

The Neutrogena Sport Face Oil-Free Lotion Sunscreen with Broad Spectrum SPF 70+ is fantastic! It works great on adults and kids in my house with sensitive skin issues! I was super impressed with its "stayability" out on the golf course and hanging out by the pool in the scorching heat.

Wore this the entire time we were in Italy to protect my face and neck from the sun since I was not wearing a sun hat. It work wonderfully. No sunburned face or neck! I really like the Neutrogena line of products.

I sweat like a burst dam when I run, but I hate being out in direct sunlight with no sun protection. I've tried a lot of sweat-proof sunscreens in the past, but everything ends up directly in my eyes after 20 minutes, and I spend the rest of my time running while squinting through one eye.  This stuff really works though. I've been on runs up to 1.5 hrs long and the sunscreen didn't budge.  Highly recommend!

This sunblock offers very good protection from the sun's harmful rays. It was easy to apply (not too difficult to rub in), and seemed to stay active throughout my round of golf. I also order Thinksport so that I could compare the 2, and the Neutrogena was much easier to use. My skin isn't necessarily sensitive, and it caused no issues with irritation or rash.

I did a lot of research Doctor agreeing is real good stuff. I live in Las Vegas and like driving my Jeep in the desert with the roof and doors off. It is very effective

It worked great for 5 days of theme park adventures in Florida with a perfect no-sunburn record. Unfortunately I got it on my eyelids one day and it was an extremely painful experience trying to remove it and getting a little in my eyes. Avoid my mistake and it should be 5 star. :)

Several reviews state that it’s white and chalky, I’m scratching my head how. Clearly these people are putting way to much on. A small amount goes a long way.

As someone who has sensitive skin that gets burned from sitting in the shade covered up, I was SO impressed with this product. In the summer, I work outside for 4+ hours and I NEVER have gotten burnt once while using this. Additionally, it doesn't break me out like most sunscreens do. It also doesn't feel like I have this thick and sticky sunscreen on my face. A little does go a long way and I often find myself sharing this with friends who have mediocre sunscreen on and are getting burnt. I also use this on my arms and it works wonderful.

eos-eos

Love the sun protection, and the way this easily is worn under make up if you wish. I gave it 4 stars for sensitive skin because it has a slight tingling sensation at first that I think people with sensitive skin may not like. I personally love this product! Never greasy, never clogs pores. It stays on through workouts and time in the sun. It's exactly what I was searching for!

eos-eos

I've only been using this product for 3 days but I absolutely love it. My skin is so sensitive I can't even use CeraVe; but this hasn't given me any breakouts and has helped reduce the hyperpigmentation in my skin from red acne scars. I do have to re-apply midday, but that could just be me being cautious. It's silky smooth!

eos-eos

Very happy with the purchase. For whatever reason, I always get burned at my brows. I wanted something that's protective and not greasy. This Sport Face cream goes on clear and easy. No greasy sensation at all. I wanted fragrance free, but this does have a mild fragrance. A light suntan lotion smell that fades quickly. It also washes off easily. No skin irritation. And no more sunburns on my brows.

I like this sunscreen for my face, because it doesn't feel greasy, or cause my mascara to slip down my face, lol. I ordered a second tube, because someone in my family made off with the first one! I will stick to this brand from now on. Gives good sun protection, non powdery, no white residue.

Once I found this product, it's the only sunscreen I will use on my oily-prone skin. I do not break out, it absorbs quite well (it's kinda thick, so u do have to rub it in). It doesn't disappear with a dip in the pool or sweating. And it's a higher spf than most face sunscreens. Definitely recommend!

eos-eos

seems to work well for my skin, I like that it’s not oily on the face and easily gets absorbed. I bought several of them and each person gets a tube to bring an reapply at school and in the car, etc. it’s worth it especially the spf it has. I even use it on my arms as well even though it is more expensive than others, it’s worth it.
