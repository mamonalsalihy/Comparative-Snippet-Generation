Before you buy, just know this: All the raves for Anthelios (which started in the mid-to-late 90's) originally were for the *European* version, which contains Mexoryl, a patented UVA blocker with proven track record in EU and Canada. Mexoryl is highly stable; it does not degrade after hours of sun exposure, rendering the "reapplication" part of sunscreen nearly moot. L'Oreal was the one to patent and develop Mexoryl, which is why it's only found in L'oreal brands outside of the US. In the late 90s and early 2000's everyone was buying Anthelios from European or Canadian sites. Coasting on this word-of-mouth success, the US version was soon launched--- but without the star ingredient which is so effective. Why?  The FDA did not approve Mexoryl as a sunscreen; Talk to anyone in cosmetic industry regulation and it's well-known that the USA is 10 years behind Europe and Asia on approving sunscreens. The list of US-approved sunscreen ingredients is very short and hasn't changed in decades; whereas in Europe and Asia the list is longer--- they get to use newer ingredients that are lighter, thinner, and more absorbent -- Another reason why EU/Asia sunscreens feel like invisible silk---and US ones tend to feel greasy/heavy.  This US version does NOT contain Mexoryl, instead it contains Avobenzone --also highly stable for many hours under the sun -- but this formula also contains Oxybenzone, a controversial ingredient (look it up). I'm not against chemical sunscreens, but I personally avoid Oxybenzone as much as I can. However, one great benefit is the milky-light texture, absorbent finish that feels weightless on skin. This is one reason why it's so popular.  If you don't care about chemical UV filters and just want an absorbent formula that works great on the face, this is a good option. But know that the Euro version is far superior, and if travelling outside the US, stock up --it's very affordable.

Warning - this is definitely not the real thing. I purchased my first bottle from a store, loved it, and ordered this one when I ran out of my first bottle. I put it on my face and went for a hike, and when I came back my face was covered in a weird yellow film. I tried it again the next day and got the same result. As my final test, I went back to the store I originally purchased from, put it on my face again and went on another hike, and it was great. Clearly, this seller isn't shipping what they claim is in the bottle (at least not in my case). Very unfortunate.

I’ve been obsessed with this facial sunscreen since my dermatologist recommended it to me years ago. It’s matte and most importantly doesn’t sting my face the way most mainstream brands do. Excellent staying power through sweat and ocean water although I of course reapply after a few hours. I am very acne prone (despite hitting forty this year!) but use this on my face and neck with no issues. Love the texture and the small bottle makes it easy to carry with me anywhere

I first received a sample of this in my Allure Beauty Box. I used up the sample as my running sunblock then mistakenly went out and purchased the white glue that is Neutrogena "Sheer." My god the difference. I had immediate remorse and hurried to purchase a full size of this Light Fluid. This is everything a sunblock should be. Light as air, dries to a reasonable sheerness and never feels gluey or heavy. No suffocating white mask of grease and zinc oxide. I even put on two layers of this for super hot runs and it never ever feels like there is anything on my skin. I am able to put on sunblock powder for my face over top of it and it does not ruin the powder or brush as the others do. This is quite simply the best sunblock ever formulated with so many good qualities that make it worth the price. I will never make the mistake of switching brands again. I am Anthelios Light Fluid for life!

Best facial sunscreen I have ever used! I have been buying this product for over 10 years and love how it doesn’t sting your eyes, doesn’t feel sticky and provides excellent sun covered. I tell all my friends and family about this product and they are all equally pleased and buy it as well. Definitely worth the extra money you spend when buying this quality product.

So, I found it a little oily still. My skin still gets that little oily therefore it doesn't hold the makeup 100% after 2 hours or so. I was about to spend more money on sunscreen thinking it would be better and I read this review that opened my horizons about this site that professionals review product. The site is: beautypedia.com/ and this is what they say about this product: "This sunscreen skips the ecamsule and provides UVA protection with avobenzone. That’s fine, but what’s interesting is that not too long ago, L’Oreal, the company that owns La Roche-Posay, was denigrating avobenzone in favor of Mexoryl SX! Why they’re now using avobenzone is a mystery, but as far as this sunscreen product is concerned, it’s an overall dud. The base formula contains too much alcohol (alcohol causes free-radical damage, dryness, and irritation) and far too little of the beneficial extras (like antioxidants) you should be looking for in sunscreens. You’ll get broad-spectrum sun protection, but that’s about it. There are far too many sunscreens available that do not contain alcohol and that do contain antioxidants for you to waste your money on this poorly formulated product." My next purchase based on their reviews will be RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 by Paula's Choice.

TL;DR: good for daily wear w oily skin, apply moisturizer beforehand First things first - I’m a skincare girly. And I’m ADHD, so sensory is an issue for me. I’m also combination skin, so this had to meet many expectations.  1 - I know the price seems a bit much, but trust me, this lasts a lot longer than it appears. I started using it in may 2022, and now it’s July 2022, and I’m only just now halfway. I apply once in the morning, and sometimes redo my skincare midday, depending on my day. I’m STILL only just now halfway through  2- sensory issues. I previously used the LRP melt in milk face and body spf 100, and HATED IT. I had to wear a mask every day for 3 weeks for AUA clinicals, and anytime I took off my mask, it looked like my skin was peeling off, and I gave this spf about 1 hour to dry every day. Now THIS sunscreen, this amazing spf. It MELTS into my skin with just a few swipes, or a what I do, gently pat it in. Feels like a light oil, doesn’t have an oily texture though  3 - my t zone gets oily as hell, so all spfs make me looking shiny asf. This mattifies down. I do recommend applying moisturizer before hand, and not fully soak in the moisture, kinda needs a primer in a way  Absolutely amazing sunscreen

La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid SPF 60, 1.7 Fl. Oz., this product is a good sunscreen, but it was shipped together with my daughter MCAT books , the package was torn up on one side it really shows that it was returned product and the lid was not closed safely to not allow it to come out, not much came out but it did. I don't like that it looks like this product was a returned product with the box already open and broken and looks used . There should have been more care in selling and sending out these products.

My husband has skin cancer - basil cell and squamas - treated every 6 months. Plus he has sensitive skin. This product he loves! It spreads easily and does not affect his skin. It does the job to protect from the sun. He is not allowed to have any sun so with this product, a hat, umbrella and proper clothing he goes to the beach with me every day. I will continue to buy for him.

I bought this product specifically because I have very sensitive skin and have a tendency to break out on my chest/neck/face when I use sun block for a repeated number of days. I was going on vacation and thought I would try this lotion because it was for "sensitive skin" and "dermatologist recommended". BOLOGNA!! I used it ONCE and broke out TERRIBLY on my chest and neck where I applied the sun screen. I was on vacation and was very upset because of this. I am not sure if I had a reaction to one of the ingredients in this lotion but DO NOT BUY if you have sensitive skin and break out easily. Save the money and go the Neutrogena Face route...

This sunscreen has been a Godsend for my dry face this winter. I apply it before any makeup in the AM, it glides on effortlessly and you can't even feel it on your face, completely weightless. It has no oily residue, no thick opacity sunscreen often has. The ingredients are minimal and what it does have is really good for your skin. My skin has thanked me profusely for this purchase. Initially I was bummed the container was so small I thought, "Woah, this bottle is tinier than I thought it would be for the hi price" however as I used it, it takes very little to cover your face, maybe 5 drops (yes drops, its a thin liquid), so it will last me a very long time and is super high quality stuff. I intend on buying again.

I live in Colorado, love running outdoors, and needed a sunscreen. I have sensitive, dry skin, and always skeptical, but this sunscreen is wonderful. It absorbs nicely. No white residue or finish. No breakouts either. I love it. I'm glad I gave it a try.

I have worn a daily moisturizer with sunscreen since I was 21. However, as I’ve grown older, I felt I needed to add an intentional layer of daily sunscreen on top of that. I tried this product after reading that it is what TV personality Kelly Ripa, who is 50 but looks 30, uses. It goes on very thin and spreads quickly and easily. It doesn’t leave any heaviness or stickiness. I truly don’t know I’ve added an extra layer to my morning routine. I’m so glad I tried it.

Es el mejor bloqueador solar para el rostro que he utilizado, no deja blanco y se aplica súper bien, no queda grasoso y se siente ligero

I have the most sensitive and dry facial skin + rosacea - most sunblocks burn and irritate and are just miserable. This is a game changer! It is not oily - it doesn't leave any residue. Will be using this long term!

I have crazy sensitive skin to the point that I will get sunburned if I stay out in the sun for more then 20 mins. This sunblock applies nicely and gives my skin a nice blur effect, great for putting on before foundation. It never drys your skin out leaving disgusting cracks or sunblock residue as other products do, and it also does not leave a white cast over the face.

Me gusto mucho este protector solar ya que no me dejó la piel grasosa ni brillosa, sentí mi piel humectada pero sin brillo que es excelente para mi. Lo recomiendo y claro lo volveré a comprar 👌🏽

Finally a sun screen that is light not heavy or thick. A little goes a long way. It dies not cause irritation or clog pores. I love how it can be layered with my other facial products too. It works wonderfully.

I wanted so badly to like this product.  I ordered it and put it on as soon as it arrived. I went for a quick run (about 20 min) in non-peak sun hours (about 5pm) in OH and met up with my husband. He took one look at me and asked if I was ok. Confused, I asked if I didn't look ok to which he responded that I had "bright yellow splotches" all over my face. Although I couldn't feel it, I hurried home and washed my face (with a white wipe so I could see it). Sure enough...neon yellow all over my face.  I am so disappointed I can't wear this in public and have contacted La Roche-Posay with my experience. Perhaps if you live in a climate with limited sun where you never sweat or are looking for something to brighten up your entire face/neck/chest, this product would work for you.

This product contains two ingredients we know to be killing the coral reefs. They're found in many sunscreens: Octinoxate, and Oxybenzone. This sunscreen contains the latter. Even if you don't care about the environment (and why not? you do live here!) you probably aren't a fan of hurricanes, tropical storms, and the resulting floods. Coral reefs protect our shoes from erosion, mitigating the damage these storms, storms increasing in frequency and intensity. All rivers eventually meet the sea. Please skip this sunscreen, and skip all others containing the ingredients Octinoxate or Oxybenzone.

My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen. It smells better than other sunscreen products, goes on smooth, you can’t see it, and no itch. I mainly use for my face and ears due to a few basal cell carcinoma Moh’s surgeries. Some other products with high SPF made me look like I had white paste on my face. This is a bit pricey but worth it to prevent more surgeries on my face.

If you have extremely pale and/or sensitive skin, this is a miracle product. Goes on matte, stays on for hours, strong sunblock, non-irritant, no strong smell.

Glides on. Protects and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Will definitely continue ordering. First tried samples given to me by my dermatologist.

I am a longtime user of Kiehls' Super Fluid Daily UV Defense Sunscreen. The La Roche-posay Anthelios Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid Extreme feels extremely similar to the Kiehls', but La Roche is half the cost. On my skin, the La Roche also feels less greasy than Kiehls.  P.S. I've tried La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Sunscreen Milk SPF 60, but that one is too heavy and greasy for me.

I have really sensitive skin and sunscreens usually make me break out or make my face SUPER dry. This was super lightweight, didn't smell, and I could barely notice it on my face. I did my normal skin routine (toner, moisturizer), put the sunscreen on and then my make up! Definitely recommend this!

eos-eos

Great waterproof sunscreen that I use for my face and neck all year round (to protect from UVB and also to prevent premature aging caused by UVA). It personally does not make me break out (of course each skin is different, YMMV), which is a relief because my skin is prone to break out. It is easy to spread and doesn't leave a white cast as some of the sunscreens do (note that my skin is pretty fair however). I put the sunscreen around my eyes and on my eyelids as well, if you do that try to not rub your eyes afterwards or you may regret it (I personally tear up when that happens). I am at my second bottle and very happy!

eos-eos

I've been using this for years. It does NOT irritate my skin and I find that I can apply makeup without a problem. TIP: Once you put in on give yourself a few minutes to let soak in before applying your foundation coverage.

I absolutely love this sunscreen. As a very fair skinned redhead, I have tried a lot of them and this is by far the best. It has a very light consistency that absorbs quickly without a greasy feel. It makes my skin velvety soft and works great as a makeup primer. As someone who wears sunscreen every single day, I cannot recommend this enough. A little goes a long way and justifies the higher price.

Probably the best face sunscreen I have ever used! Great under make up, truly soaks into your skin! Works great! I have extremely sensitive skin, it didn’t irritate me at all! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

What can i say about La Roche Posay? I’m fair-skinned and can’t go without it! Non-greasy, always effective, I’ve been using their sunscreen for many years. If I don’t buy it when I’m in France, I order it through Amazon. Much more reasonable than a drug store.

I normally never use sunscreen because of how irritating it is to my eyes. I am extremely pale and have light blonde hair to match so sunscreen is something I must have to protect my skin. I never imagined how wonderful this would be. It has the consistency of water and just melts into your skin without an intense sunscreen odor. It also does not leave a greasy look after absorbed into the skin. I will continue to buy this product refill after refill. Must have

I think Anthelios is worth the higher price because it lasts on my skin much, much longer, according to my dermatologist about 5 times as long. It's a thin liquid, and a little bit goes a long way, helping bring down the cost. I'm not sure yet, but I think it's not as sweatproof and river water proof as Neutrogena sport, but for everyday wear, it's great! I've had a couple of skin cancers, and blocking the sun is very important to me. Another good product in my arsenal of skin saving items.

Goes on smooth with no grease or stickiness or white residue and offers great protection.

this product is Awesome . I used it on my mexico trip. It saved me from getting sun tan. Its so smooth to apply just like a moisturizer. I recommend everyone to use it ...and say bye-bye to those messy,smelly ,thick regular sunscreen which makes you look like ghost. Thanks to La Roche-Posay sunscreen.

Easy to apply with no white shadow (that I could see). I'm 65 and found this to give the best complete sun protection when outside. I do use a large hat that is not sun proof but even if I'm hatless and in summer sun for an hour this provides complete protection. It works better than any other product I've used. Using it daily on my face it lasted2-3 months.  Their tinted sunscreen is also nice.

This is the best as it will absorb almost immediately and is of course very effective in preventing burns. My dermatologist upon last check stated your forehead looks very very good. I have had some precancerous spots before. I have tried the cream but will be using this liquid from now on.

A coworker recommended this product to me and I'm so happy I listened to her. I have combination to oily skin, especially oily in my T-zones. I also have sensitive skin and am diligent about using sunscreen since I live in Hawaii and the sun here can get blazing hot. I have been using this sunscreen for almost 4 weeks now and love it. There is not much of scent and it glides on smoothly and quickly since it is liquidly and not thick. A little bit of it goes a long way.

Used this product years ago when I was working hospitality industry - it was our company's best selling product. Stopped using it cause it was expensive for a small bottle of sunscreen. But rediscovered the sunscreen again at a RiteAid Store in 2012 and loving it. Still expensive but as i get older and my skin changes with age/environment, I've come to realize how critical good sunscreen is essential in my life - so yes, it's worth the cost. Apply it every day under moisturizer on face, neck and chest; so light and non-greasy (very important as I have oily skin) - always forget I have it on. I don't wear foundation but apply a light dusting of loose powder to keep the shine away - oil still sometimes appears but not because I have on this particular sunscreen. How much do i love this 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face? LOL - enought that I always order several bottles at one time - 1 for home, 1 always in my purse, 1 for sports bag. Never go anywhere without my Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face :-)

I couldn't justify spending this much on facial sunscreen, but after reading the resounding reviews, I decided to try it out. It lasts beautifully and I wear it daily, under makeup or all by itself. I have problem skin (acne and oil issues), and hated the white film the other sunscreens left on my face. It is now my go -to and I simply replenish every few months. Outstanding product @ highly competitive price.

I live in Hawaii and work outside as a mail carrier. I started using this product about 3 years ago when Costco carried it. It is very light, with no greasy look or feel. I put it on before I leave for work and it keeps me protected all day long. Costco only carried it for a short time, so I've been buying it on Amazon for the best prices and fast shipping. I've tried every sunscreen and there is none better for your face!

I am a fair-skinned, blue-eyed blonde male and every sunscreen I have ever used caused cystic acne on my face. A dermatologist recommended I give this one a try and, so far, no acne after 10 applications! For me, this is the best facial sunscreen ever. Expensive though, so I suggest you only use it on your face.

I bought this sunscreen because it is non-irritating. I use this sunscreen mixed with a small amount of mineral makeup to make a non irritating bb cream. Most other high spf sunscreens cause my skin to revolt, and so this one is a welcome addition to my purse. It is small, but you don't use very much per application (a little goes a long way) and it fits easily in your bag. I have been on the same little bottle for everyday use for about 5 weeks now (and still going strong). I live in a high UV index place so I use it a few times a day.  It applies clean and without an oily residue. Not as clean as their 'water feel' sunscreens, but it is awesome.
