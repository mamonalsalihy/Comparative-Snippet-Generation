This sunscreen is pretty wet. It does the job but don’t love applying this. It feels like putting water on the kids and not the substance that you’d expect. We love Coppertone Sunscreen but not this variant.

Unless you want your clothes to be stained, don’t buy this product.

I saw the advertisement on the broadcast and read the Amazon review and bought it. I bought this and used it on the child right away. The next day, the child had skin rash. It is no longer available.

Please read the ingredients the formula changed, and now has a chemical wax that causes skin irritations
