My kids have sensitive ezcema skin. Aveeno is the only brand that helps their skin heal. I was looking for a large pump daily sunscreen that is not too thick. This is exactly what I was looking for.

I like how this doesn’t feel all sticky and greasy like other sunscreens for body. This smells nice too. And it is very moisturizing

Oh my gosh!!! There is no way this is a sunscreen!!! No white, it smells fantastic, and it really does go on just like lotion. I couldn’t believe how easy this was to apply to my toddler who hates lotions of any kind. I keep checking the bottle to make sure it is in deed sunscreen. I’m anxious to see how this does with actually protecting from the sun. If it keep sunburn away I definitely will never by any other kind of sunscreen!!

Like the light feel and moisturizing of this product. I put it on in the morning and don't have to think about sun protection all day.

I love everything Aveeno, so when I saw this, I had to try it. It goes on so easily, like lotion. It doesn’t leave white behind on your skin like most sunscreens. It’s literally like applying lotion. I use a little bit less on my face, just because if you’re a sweater, it WILL drip into your eyes if you over applied. I wore this to the beach though and didn’t burn! I use this on the kids I nanny too and their mom loves it too! It doesn’t have a nasty sunscreen smell either.

I have an anti immune disease that makes me sun sensitive. Have tried at least 10 different sun screens and they all made my skin feel horrible. This product made my skin soft and protected it while I was visiting Las Vegas with the sun blaring and 107 degrees I highly recommend that you try it.

The product does not have a plastic stop on the dispenser, so had leaked on the shipping box and was dirty. It appeared to have been used and then repackaged before arriving later than tracking said. I sent it back, still waiting on refund.
