I manage a hotel and this is the perfect product to give children when they are at the pool and dont have proper sun screen. It is sanitary because it is single packets and it is easy to use. I would almost like the packets to be a bit bigger though cause you need multiple packets for an adult.

This is a handy way to make sunblock available to a group. It works well as part of a gift basket or goodie bag for all types of events from beach party to golf tournament.

We give away these packets of sunscreen. One packet easily covers the face, arms and legs of a person with some left over.
