Fifteen-year-old me needed this! As someone with darker skin, fifteen-year-old me was using my camp counselor's or friends' sunscreens and walking around the campsite looking ashy. Thankfully present-day me is tired of playing around. I'm really impressed by this sunscreen. It's easy to apply and doesn't take much to blend into my skin. It also leaves behind a nice glow! I literally held my arm to the sunlight and it was shimmering. I don't know if there are literal glitter bits in the lotion but it would explain the shine. Also, the price was fantastic.

This is a great sunscreen and smells so good!

Great product to use daily on sensitive skins. It applies easily and gets absorbed quickly to the skin, leaving no white spots

Easy to spread, delightful scent, and long lasting coverage. Perfect for Hawaii as it does not harm reef. Loved everything about it.

It works well and smells good. But my hubby was sparkling like Edward Cullen on a sunny day when we were at the beach. I didnâ€™t realize it had shimmer in it. I may have missed that in the description! I loved it for myself, though!

Good spf and excellent ,no sticky feel for peeling off. The scent is very strong as most tanning stuff are not unpleasant,though would like a lighter or unscented.
