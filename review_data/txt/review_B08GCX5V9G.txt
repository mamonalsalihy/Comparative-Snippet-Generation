Y‚Äôall. I almost didn‚Äôt want to like this product. I‚Äôve done a LOT of research on sunscreen. A LOT. I‚Äôm a akin junkie and use retinol and acids in my skin care, so SPF is a MUST for me. I tried many, many brands of mineral sunscreens, only to always end up looking like a ghost. NOTHING helped (not blending, not powder, not even a good match on the tinted versions). They all felt greasy and heavy, stung my sensitive skin and caused burning/redness/peeling or they gave me a ghost face.  I did so much research and the super goop kept being a top rated pic. But for the price I put it off and thought ‚Äúno way it‚Äôs worth that!‚Äù. I almost secretly looked forward to NOT liking it so I could be like ‚ÄúI KNEW it!‚Äù.  Well‚Ä¶..I love it and it is 100% worth the price. No stinging (at ALL‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt even feel it!), no flaming, no greasy feeling (it almost feels like satin or a really good primer) and no cast to skin tone.  My verdict: the hype was well earned ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I was hesitant to purchase this because of how expensive it is for the amount you‚Äôre given but it was totally worth it! I usually have issues with sunscreens and moisturizers making my other skin care products peel (I use hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and alpha arbutin) but this sunscreen is perfect! I experienced no peeling and no white caste like you would with mineral sunscreens. The texture feels like a foundation primer and doesn‚Äôt look or feel greasy. Highly recommend and definitely worth it.

eos-eos

My dermatologist recommended this. I love it. Easy to apply. Feels like silk. Very light on skin and that encourages me to use it every day. I hated the heavy feel of my past sunscreens. I can put this on under or over my moisturizer and/or make up. It may be pricey, but a little goes a long way and its lasted me a couple months, face only, daily use.

eos-eos

My friends got me hooked on this product and I can't go back. It's a great sunscreen that is sheer and doesn't leave your skin oily or shiny. It hasn't caused any new breakouts. I end my skin care routine with it every day. It even holds up quite well in the water. If you are in the sun constantly, this is a must have in your skin care routine. The price may seem high for the small container but it will last you a long time. It looks like Vaseline in terms of consistency, but goes into the skin very nicely.

eos-eos

No white cast super soft and not greasy. I can‚Äôt even tell I have it on. It doesn‚Äôt burn my skin or eyes like others do. Definitely love this product as much as the ‚Äúbeat the sun by Krave‚Äù which is sold out everywhere abs takes longer to arrive. I‚Äôm definitely switching to this product. I only wish it was spf 50

My skin has burned TWICE while using this supposed SPF 40 sunscreen.  The first time I figured I was out in the sun too long but after the second time I figured out the sunscreen is NOT SPF 40.  Most recently I applied a thick layer of Unseen Sunscreen to my face, neck and shoulders before going out shopping. I walked in and out of stores and under shaded walkways for 1.5 hours and both my face and shoulders burned (see photo). There is a distinct line where my sleeveless top ended, which I only wore while shopping.  My normal SPF 15 lotion has better sun protection than this. I am beyond disappointed because the texture of this lotion is phenomenal. If it had worked I would have shelled out money to use it on my face, neck and shoulders all summer long.  I also wrote directly to the company about this SPF problem and they responded within the hour, requesting additional information (such as the lot#) which implies that they do care about the quality of their products. Hopefully my SPF was a fluke for them.

Tiny, tiny tube for $17.00?

It never stings around the eyes even on my sensitive face. I also love the transparent color and moisturizing character.

eos-eos

I would like to say this is the best sunscreen I ever came across. Being a woman of color this is the best hands down the size and the price is not really worth it but oh well I'll buy it again.

eos-eos

This is ludicrously small. It is the size of a silver dollar and the contents would only last a day or two. However, the cost is $18.00 for next to nothing. My wife wanted to know why I bought an american girl doll sunscreen prop. I told it was a real product and she laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a little fat girl.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúSay it!‚Äù She yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little fat girl‚Äù I admitted and went to my room to cry.

This primer+sunscreen is a chemical sunscreen, which is great for the lightweight feel and completely sheer finish, but not so great for my skin, which is super sensitive and acne prone. Anyone else with this skin type, maybe avoid it and go for a mineral sunscreen instead. I literally haven't been wearing any sunscreen because this stuff broke me out SO BAD I have been waiting for my skin to "reset" for like... 20 days. And I only used the product for 3 days. :| It might work great for some people, but it did NOT work for me... just wanted to offer an alternate opinion for any sensitive skin/acne prone homies out there.

eos-eos

The media could not be loaded. If you are a black girl looking for a screen with no white cast on your skin this is it. It goes on the skin very light and smooth. It is not heavy or oily on the skin, I have oily skin and this is perfect.

eos-eos

Fave sunscreen for every day use. The texture is perfect for over and under makeup.

eos-eos

The bottle is way too small for 24 bucks, and theres barely any product in it. Dont waste your $

eos-eos

Holy Cow, this is the absolute best sunscreen in existence that I have come across. I have tried every major sunscreen brand, skincare brand of sunscreen and nothing has come close to the checklist this brand checks off. First off, Cruelty Free and Vegan are must haves for me, and not only are they both but they are also a reef safe brand; incredibly hard to find in good sunscreens. As for the product itself it glides on the skin like literal velvet, extremely lightweight. Covers smoothly, leaves zero sheen or whitecast, wears under makeup extremely well for a sunscreen; went all day and had no beading or pilling of makeup. I Had no redness or sun reaction so it worked all day; I have worn it for up to 9 hours at a time with no need to reapply. A little goes a long way, you only need a dime size for the face to get complete coverage or about a quarter size for neck and d√©colletage. Is safe for malezia and acne prone skin, particularly fungal acne prone skin, which was a huge must for me, as most sunscreens cause breakouts due to the harsh chemicals added. Fragrance was barely there, didn‚Äôt really smell anything. Overall the best sunscreen I have ever tried.

eos-eos

This is NOT reef safe, even though it's printed right there on the bottle. It has octocrylene and avobenzone in it, both are banned in Palau, Hawaii, and the US Virgin Islands for being harmful to marine life. Avobenzone is believed to have adverse health effects on humans, too. This is a pile of ridiculously priced chemical junk, don't make the mistake I did and trust the 'reef safe' designation on the packaging, I should have looked at the ingredients, that's on me.

eos-eos

I have extremely dry, sensitive skin due to Hashimoto's. And at almost 40 I also have sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles that I‚Äôm wishing away with Tretinoin and Hydroquinone. So to that I was in desperate need of an awesome sunscreen that really provides solid sun protection, doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin, and still looks perfect under makeup or without. I‚Äôve tried a lot, I mean a butt load of sunscreens. And this is my new #1! This is it. My new sorcery in a bottle. My skin literally gobbles it up. Dries in seconds and provides this beautiful matte finish. Is it pricey yes! But for what is the most critical step in my skin routine I feel it‚Äôs worth the $!

eos-eos

I‚Äôve been searching everywhere for a daily SPF that won‚Äôt pill or leave a white cast when layered on other products. Here is my typical routine and my skin hasn‚Äôt been this happy in a decade. I have olive tone combination skin that gets very dry around my nose, but oily in the rest of the T zone.  ‚Ä¢ Cleanse with micellar water ‚Ä¢ Gentle AHA+PHA exfoliating serum (AprilSkin) ‚Ä¢ Artemisia Rice Toner (AprilSkin) ‚Ä¢ Snail Mucin Essence 96 (Cosrx) ‚Ä¢ Snail Mucin Moisturizing Cream (Cosrx) ‚Ä¢ Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen  You can look up the ingredients in all of those to compare with any layering/pill issues you may be experiencing too. The chemical exfoliate, essence, and cream together made other SPFs pill like CRAZY no matter how long I waited between layers. My skin felt phenomenal until I had to throw on the SPF, then I felt like a slimy, peely mess. Not so with Supergoop!  The consistency out of bottle IS a bit like neosporin but settles nicely into the skin fairly quick. It‚Äôs clear so no white cast. It does well as a primer as advertised, and if you‚Äôre worried about any residual shine you can use a bit of setting powder and be perfectly alright. I‚Äôve been going completely makeup-free though for the past few weeks (except a bit of eyeliner).  No breakouts, rashes, or midday greasiness to report so far but will update if that changes.

eos-eos

While this product seems to work great for sun protection, it gets a meh review for two reasons: 1) it's THICK. Problematic-level thick. It has the consistency of Neosporin, which makes it very difficult to apply evenly without putting on too much. I've been using this regularly for over a month now and have yet to apply what feels like the right amount. 2) it pills under foundation. I specifically researched sun protection for daily wear under foundation, and this was recommended. Now, the pilling could very well be due to not the inability to get the right amount of product applied, but the issue remains the same. Pros: effective sun protection, it leaves no white cast, and it the smell isn't awful (doesn't smell good, but the scent is mild and doesn't make me want to chuck the bottle out the window). Over all I would definitely not recommend as a daily wear sunscreen.

eos-eos

This product is indeed lightweight and invisible. It feels slightly greasy to touch but once spread, feels like it's been absorbed, and thankfully it does not seem to break me out. This was recommended to me by my sister after trying so many different mineral or chemical, oil or water-base sunscreens. I used to use Goddess Garden Organics sunscreen for kids, which did not break me out but was mineral-based and left major white tint on my face. It also did not blend well with my moisturizer. So I'm glad this supergoop sunscreen is indeed invisible, spreads easily and has not noticeably irritated my sensitive and acne-prone skin. I've been able to apply it to my forehead without getting bumps all over. Sticking to this product from now on!

eos-eos

This is great SPF. Goes on smoothly and goes great with makeup (no pilling or white cast). Absolutely the best.

eos-eos

This goes on so smoothly! And for a change, it didn't break my face out. So for the money (which I find pretty pricy), it's a good buy for me. I took it to the beach and everyone I was with tried it out and loved it (about 6 adults). I still have quite a bit left in the tube so it seems to last a long time, too. It didn't seem to bother anyone's skin except for one person, who gets irritated at any sunscreen. She ended up with a mineral based sunscreen that worked better for her. Everyone else liked this one. No strong smell and didn't feel greasy.

eos-eos

So as a person of color its always difficult to find sunscreens that don't leave a whitecast on your skin. Since this is a mineral sun screen the white cast is less likely but still possible, but this sunscreen doesn't leave that at all. Its great but the only issue i experienced was pilling after putting it onto of my moisturizer (vanicream). I waited 10 minutes then applied and still had pilling on my cheeks. If anyone has any suggestions on how to prevent this, let me know. Still a great sunscreen for sunprotetion without leaving a white cast

eos-eos

I was always hesitant to purchase this because of it's price, but the second I did it, I was hooked. This sunscreen, unlike a lot of other facial sunscreens, goes on clear and easy to absorb-no looking like a ghost with this one! The formula is really smooth, easy to apply and absorbs onto your skin quickly. It also acts as a primer-so you can apply makeup right on top of it. I wear this everyday and feel like my face is always protected. Even in situations where I apply sunscreen to the rest of my body (other brands) and have gotten burns, my face is never impacted, so I'm pretty sure that means Supergoop is doing it's job right!

eos-eos

So pleased with this product! A little goes a long way. It applies like a makeup primer and feels like one!! I haven‚Äôt worn for longer than 2 hours of sun exposure, but would probably need a reapplication around that time or much sooner if sweating or in water. It‚Äôs pricey, but better than other options I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve been using it a few times a week (I work nights and don‚Äôt need sunscreen application daily) and my skin has not had any ill effects.

eos-eos

This product is so worth it. Really. I was skeptical with the price and all, but i‚Äôm wearing sunscreen on my face DAILY and that never used to happen. Before trying Supergoop, sunscreen was a pain. I mean literally. It would irritate my sensitive skin, get in my eyes, always leave a white cast, and never layer well with makeup. Supergoop is a life changer, and I would honestly use it anyway even if it wasn‚Äôt a sunscreen, which is saying a lot. This sunscreen is completely clear, and leaves a really nice finish on the face, so I use it was a primer under my makeup. One con is that I noticed some pilling later in the day after wearing a full coverage foundation, but I haven‚Äôt seen that since. (It also might not have been the sunscreens fault lol) So yeah!! 10/10 for me, and I will definitely be purchasing again and again.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is a bit on the expensive side .5 oz. for $17 but it really does work with not letting your face get sunburned. I bought it because it said it was NOT GREASY as most sunscreens are, well, it really isn't greasy at all, it is like a serum consistency. When you have the product on your face it is not like most sunscreens, that are heavy and greasy, it is very light and hardly noticeable on your skin. I highly recommend this product if you can deal with the price.

eos-eos

I was introduced to this sunscreen by a dermatologist when I asked her if she knew of a sunscreen I could put on my face and my forehead in particular that wouldn't run when I sweat profusely. I road ride bicycles, and in the summertime, I really sweat profusely. I've been out riding with this on my face and forehead in almost 90¬∞F temperature, and it still didn't run into my eyes. Of course, it's a bonus when it's fully transparent and doesn't leave a white ghost face. It stays on throughout an over two-hour ride and works quite well for sun protection. As far as I'm concerned, I've found the answer for what I was looking for.

eos-eos

A friend recommended this product so I purchased a small size as a trial. I now love this so much that I've purchased a larger size. It's a little pricey but worth it. It feels so silky and lightweight on my face and makes my foundation go on so much smoother. Some days, I don't even use foundation as I don't feel the need, it makes my skin look smooth and flawless. I've thrown out other primers I had as I'll no longer use anything else. As far as the sunscreen, it seems to do a good job also. I spent several days in the sun at an amusement park last week with no problems. I was concerned as I didn't reapply during the day, but it was fine.

eos-eos

Love this. I‚Äôm a brown skin girl who had difficulties finding a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt leave white cast or super oily. Supergoop Unseen is a blessing. It blends well, plays well with all kinds of moisturizer. Doesn‚Äôt feel greasy at all. My go to! Highly recommend.

eos-eos

This may depend on my skin type but once i used this my skin broke out into little clear bumps on my forehead and cheeks.

eos-eos

I am a sunscreen enthusiast and being a brown girl I have had enough disappointments. Chemical sunscreens burned my eyes and mineral sunscreens left severe white caste on my face (yes, even the tinted ones). However, I am very excited to have found this sunscreen. No white cast at all, no greasy finish, didn't dry out my face, and the most important- no teary eyes. This is the second chemical sunscreen after Murad Invisiblur that didnt burn my eyes. With this being cheaper than Murad and higher SPF, for me Supergoop is the winner.

eos-eos

I have tried so many different sunscreens trying to find the perfect one for my darker skin tone. Something that doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast, doesn‚Äôt leave the skin oily and heavy.  Bottom line- Any mineral based sunscreen is going to leave a white cast. Some will leave more some will leave less but they all do.  This chemical one is the only one that works for me. I have it on when I go to work, the gym etc.. Matte finish (You have to rub it in good first), there will be a shine at first but within 10-15 mins it‚Äôs gone. Doesn‚Äôt feel heavy and doesn‚Äôt irritate the skin (for me at least).  Great product !

eos-eos

I struggle to find sunscreens that both my dermatologist recommend and that I can wear under my make up but this sunscreen is one that I can definitely say works amazing as a make up primer and does not cause me to be extra oily which I struggle with and the sunscreen protection works really well. I work for a company where I spend a lot of time outside and selling products in an environment where I am in the sun between 6 to 8 hours of my day so I really love this sunscreen and would recommend it to anyone that wants sunscreen to wear under their make up

eos-eos

I have extremely oily skin. There is only one foundation I have found that will stay half-way decently and primers don't seem to help much. Usually sunscreens make it worse but I use it anyway b/c I want to take care of my skin. I was blown away by this product. It goes on and looks just like primer. You can tell instantly when you put your foundation on that something is different about this product by the way your make up goes on. It works better than Smashbox primer. I will never buy a primer again thanks to this. Can't speak to the sun protection b/c its February but I am optimistic!

eos-eos

Love this product! It is silky smooth and doesn‚Äôt leave my face feeling caked. Would recommend. (Not sponsored)

eos-eos

I absolutely love this product- On my second tube. It protects from harmful UV rays and leaves a matte, easy glide finish for makeup. I use it everyday because I am also using a BHA skin toner product that can lead to sunburn. Zero stingy eyes with this sunscreen and it stays on. I apply it all over my face, ears, front and back of my neck and exposed areas of my chest before starting my makeup application in the morning. Highly recommended!

eos-eos

I love that this completely disappears almost immediately after putting it on. It really doesn't feel like you're wearing sunscreen. I also love that it works as a makeup primer. I don't love how expensive it is but I just use it when I am going to be wearing makeup so I'm not going through it super quickly. The smell is quite strange but goes away pretty quickly and it isn't moisturizing at all. I have dry skin so true "matte" products don't work for me and this is definitely not that. It is kind of satiny so it's not bad but it definitely doesn't make my skin feel hydrated like some other sunscreens can

eos-eos

My sensitive skin reacts to mineral sunscreens, so I‚Äôve been looking for a high SPF, reef-friendly alternative. Very happy with the Supergoop products I‚Äôve tried! Unseen spreads in smoothly and feels dry right away. It leaves a soft, velvety touch on your skin. Kind of hard to describe, but it doesn‚Äôt feel greasy or oily at all. And you can‚Äôt tell that you‚Äôre wearing it. I‚Äôve found that their other products work on my face also, but this goes on clear so it‚Äôs super ‚Äúunseen.‚Äù It would work under makeup also.

eos-eos

I did alot of research finding a facial sunscreen, and I'm happy I chose this one. First of all its light in texture and applies smoothly, leaves no residue at all. No ashy white color on the face, and I am brown skinned. Doesnt show up when sweating either. There is no smell, and even in the hot sun, it never melted into my eyes. I am using prescription anti acne medication and products, and even though my skin is very sensitive right now, there has been no negative reaction with my skin. Added bonus its reef safe, which makes me happy. Excellent buy! My new go to and I am recommending it to family and friends.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is absolutely amazing! It's clear, leaves no streaks or residue at all, and blends right into your skin or under makeup. Solid sun protection, I haven't been burned while wearing it. My favorite part is that it doesn't feel like other sunscreens which can feel greasy or heavy. It goes on so smoothly and feels like you're not wearing anything other than moisturizer. I use it along with my regular serum and moisturizer and it still doesn't feel heavy. Highly recommend this product!

eos-eos

I REALLY love this product, especially because I've been looking for a good face sunscreen for a while. This sunscreen doesn't smell at all, feels light and thin going on the face without feeling oily, and it soaks into the skin in a short amount of time so there is no residue or shine. The product itself is a clear gel-like substance and you only need a small bit of it to go a long way! I 100% recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin OR as a makeup primer for those who include spf into their skincare.

eos-eos

I don‚Äôt like how small the bottle is. I want to buy a six month supply. This bottle lasts me about one month if I‚Äôm not sharing.  That is the only negative, everything else about this sunscreen is a holy grail. It‚Äôs not greasy, doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast, and keeps me from getting sunburned. It doesn‚Äôt melt on my face and bleed into my eyes causing stinging.  It is what sunscreen should be.  I just need to be able to buy a big tub of it.

eos-eos

Wow! I can't say how happy I am to have found this sunscreen! It comes out of the tube as a clear light gel. But it glides on flawlessly and isn't perfumed. It doesn't have any sheen to it whatsoever! I mean who wants a shiny face?! Go ahead, apply face makeup..without waiting for product absorption.  Also, you won't feel it on your skin. I generously spread it down my neck and on my decolletage. It doesn't stain clothes and because it goes on "dry", you won't feel "sealed up."  I'm a forever fan!

eos-eos

Here it is May and I am looking forward to a summer in the garden. My skin is older and burns easily. But I hate goopy, sticky, smelly lotion on my face that dirt sticks to. Enter Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen. The answer to my prayers. I put it on OVER my makeup as the last thing just before I go out. It glides on, disappears and feels smooth and dry. Of course I wear a hat with a good brim, too. Take care of your skin and it will last a lifetime.

eos-eos

Love this product! Goes on really nice (perfect canvas for make up, as it does feel like a primer), colorless, and works! I severely burned my back and shoulders when I failed to put sunscreen on my body. My face showed no signs of sun and I was out all day! It‚Äôs a bit pricey but I will continue to buy it. Not having a colorless sunscreen (white cast) and not liking the texture, I have not been faithful wearing it daily. Between that and bad burns growing up, I already have precancerous lesions. I wish I found this sooner.

eos-eos

I purchased this sunscreen for myself but started to use it on my whole family while we were on vacation. It is so smooth and soft. Unlike mineral-based sunscreen that leaves a white, icky mess, this goes on so well. Both of my kiddos has sensory issues, and this is the only face sunscreen that works for them. If you are going to be in a high-sun area, you might want to reapply more frequently than every 40 min.

eos-eos

By far the best facial sunscreen ever. No white cast at all. Not greasy. Not creamy. It just disappears and leaves a matte finish. It doesn‚Äôt get weird in my beard. It doesn‚Äôt make my eyes burn. It‚Äôs perfect if a sunscreen could be. My skin type is acne prone, oily to combination. Finally something I can use.

eos-eos

I probably can't afford it all the time, but this is definitely the best sunscreen I've ever used. It is the only one that doesn't leave a greasy oily residue or a white cast it is awesome! But too pricey for me to use daily

eos-eos

I have naturally oily skin, and when I say this is good I mean it‚Äôs good. It doesn‚Äôt sit on top of your skin, doesn‚Äôt leave a cast, and makes my skin matte but not too matte - none of that dead dull skin look. The only complaint is the smell is unique, it‚Äôs not scented, it‚Äôs just the smell of the ingredients. The smell fades quickly though and my skin stays matte for literally hours after application. A+ every day sunscreen
