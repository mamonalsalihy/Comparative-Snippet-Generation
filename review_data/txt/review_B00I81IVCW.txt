This sunscreen is amazing. This is coming from someone who has a large family and is going on a vacation where the sun is always shining. This sunscreen went on extremely smooth, and not oily at all. The pump is very handy for easy application. We went on a five day vacation with our family and came back with no burns, and no dry, cracked skin. Especially for the price, honestly this is your best bet. Chemical free? Yes. Cruelty free? Yes. Great protection? Yes. Even swimming this sunscreen stayed on very well, but just in case make sure to reapply every time you towel dry off, and get out of the water. We will definitely be using this every year, thanks to this amazing sunscreen!

Not a no tear type of sunscreen but goes on just fine. Not a metal oxide sunscreen so it doesn't discolor your skin. Good value and great dispensing for a stationary location to put the sunscreen.

I have not tried the product, so I can not review if the sunscreen lives up to its great claims, I sure hope it does. My first bottle came with its seal removed, part of it was still around the rim of the bottle. Amazon sent me a replacement bottle and I need to mail the first bottle back. The second bottle arrived today. This one had no seal at all on the bottle. It came shrink-wrapped in plastic, yet no seal over the actual bottle like what one would expect so that one knows if the content has been tampered with. I do not like writing a negative review, yet thought this might be good information for others to know about the sunscreen.

I bought this specifically because it was advertised as non greasy, but it’s just as greasy as any other sunscreen. Not pleased AT ALL, will be returning.

I purchased two of these on separate occassions. I just opened both up to use and one is completely watery and awful. The entire thing is unusable. The other one was great and is perfect for exactly what we needed. I am frustrated that the exact same product could be so inconsistent. I am hoping for a refund for one. Or atleast to send me another one please.

A gallon of lotion, not bad. I think the price is good considering how much you're getting, and quality wise, and it's not greasy. If you think of how much you pay for other lotions you'll see you're saving money. It brings a cap for storage, and a pump for usage. Happy sun bath!

We live in beautiful, sunny FL and keep this on every bathroom counter. This is our third purchase. It is effective, doesn’t clog pores with no scent. Great for everyday use.

No safety seal, dirty bottle, and watery lotion. Either reused/refilled bottle and appear with some water added, or a fake. Either way it’s Very worrisome.

This is such a perfect buy we all go through sunscreen like crazy and this stuff is awesome and it dissolves quickly you don’t feel greasy it’s perfect on the skin

last Bottle is terrible goes on in clumps I have been ordering this product for over 4 years without a problem of course the return window is April 2 2019 and I just opened because it’s the start of our summer season where I live won’t order Again very disappointed .

Good lotion, good value. Pump sucks, as others have pointed out.

eos-eos

Protective seal broken and bottle was clearly opened. I am returning this as unsafe.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is terrible. It’s pasty and hard to apply. I threw it out.

eos-eos

It blocks the sun! And for the price it's not bad. It doesn't rub in very easily, so you've gotta rub it on, then let it sit for a minute or two, and then rub it the rest of the way in. Would update to 5 stars if it were a little less greasy or rubbed in more easily.

best chemical free & moisterizing

Product goes on smooth and easy. I used it when I am mowing and driving tractors. It always protects my arms.

I have struggled to find a sunscreen that stayed on and continued to survive my profuse sweating during soccer games. I applied this product to my face, including my forehead, with my fingers crossed. I fully expected to have another eye-burning, towel-wiping experience. It did not happen AND i received little to no sun.

Wonderful easy to apply sunscreen. Living in Florida... sunscreen is a MUST. My husband and I love this sunscreen...

Product came with safety seal broken and missing.

I purchased this to use at the summer camp I work at. It is easy to use and the kids enjoyed being able to get the sunscreen out themselves. A large amount does come out with each pump so if you're using with children consider placing rubber bands on the neck so the pump doesn't bring so much up from the bottle. It also works well! We had zero sunburns!

This is the best sunscreen on the market in my opinion.

Doesnt leave oil or a perfume smell on my skin. Feels like Im just putting on a light lotion. My favorite sunscreen.

eos-eos

I'm sure the sunscreen is fine. However, the box was oozing sunscreen from the corners all over my front porch by the time I got home. Guess I'll use it

Doesn’t rub in. Doesn’t spread out

This is a great product. Moisturized well and is not greasy. Easy for the kids to apply themselves.

There was no seal on the bottle and black gunk along the rim of the bottle.

It comes off right away in the pool.

Applied this 3 time in a 4 hour event. Still burnt.

It is non greasy which is a plus.

Greasy when you first apply but soaks right in. Works great for long periods in the pool!

A little shiny on the face but spf powder sets it. Great product. Love the pump and quantity.

As a sunblock, it's fine, but not as much of a daily moisturizer as I'd like!

Broken seal.

Love this stuff. It really protects my skin and doesn't feel greasy.

Great product

I wish I could provide a good review because it doesn't have a lot of harmful chemicals. It glides on the skin smoothly. It has a neutral scent and does not leave a white chalky tracenon your skin. I bought this for my girls who take swim lessons and loves playing in the water. But, after a half an hour of swim lesson, my daughter's skin turned toasty tan. Both girls had sunburn on their faces, shoulders, and legs. I did apply the sunscreen after swimming and every two hours.

Excellent sun screen spf 30

My husband and I were taking a cross country car trip so I ordered this to protect us from burning while riding in the car. After reading all the reviews this seemed to.be a very good product. I don't know if we just got a bad batch or if we are both extremely sensitive to something in this product or if it is simply intrinsically inferior, but both of us broke out with tiny, fluid filled, painful blisters on any parts of our bodies where we had applied the product. After discontinuing using it, the blisters turned into a hard, whitish rash. More than a week later, the rash is still present. I cannot recommend this product to anyone!

Terrible product, greassy, goes into the eyes, hate it.

My daughter is enjoys outdoor activity. She goes through sun screen a lot faster than regular lotion. But, she always have hard time finding high SPF that doesn’t make her skin to breakout.  • No skin irritation from high SPF - Even though, she didn’t really need to use this from sun protection at the moment since weather is still not right for the beach, but soon she will be going to the beach and involved outdoor sports. So she did try this on her skin to make sure if her skin will breakout from it or not she applied on her face and neck, which is the most sensitive part of her body. She said this is very mild and she didn’t have any irritation from using this lotion.  • Water resistant - This sun screen is SPF 30 and water resistant, so it should last longer than the one that just wash off, especially going in and out of water sports.  • Does not leave residue – This lotion goes on smoothly and light. Also, It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy after application.  I purchased this item at discounted price for the review purpose. Whether I paid full price or not, what I wrote about the product in this review is entirely my own and it did not influence by anyone. I also gave rating of the product based on my own observation and experience from trying out the product.

I can't wait to really be outside this summer with this sunscreen. I love wearing it, feels more like a lotion we use daily, it is fast absorbing and not oily at all. You put it on and forget you're even wearing sunscreen because you can't feel or smell it like other sunscreens. It has a fresh, clean smell too, not a commercial smell at all. A little bit goes along ways with this stuff, so it doesn't take a lot, which is nice, making it last longer. It is nice that we can swim for 80 minutes and not have to worry about if it's working or not. It is so light and natural on your skin that you can put your make up right over it like you would with a moisturizer and it doesn't affect the makeup at all. I have sensitive skin and I have had no reactions to this product at all. I will continue to use this product. This review is my opinion in my own words. As an avid online shopper that relies on reviews herself I will always be honest in all reviews. I hope my review has helped you with any questions you might have had about this product, if not feel free to post a question and I will answer honesty and to the best of my ability.

Love the texture of the sunscreen. Not to thick when applied. I usually wear the sunscreen before applying my make up in the morning. I did notice that it has a little tint of shine when applied. Does protect when out in the sun. I have not any kind of sunburns nor any redness. I use sunscreen on a daily basis and feel the need to apply more if needed. I been wearing the sunscreen for more than a week and love it! I also received this product at discount price when purchased.
