I can’t wear typical, drug-store, chemical-laced sunscreen on my face & chest. I break out in hives. For 4 years, I relied on a natural, barrier-style sunscreen called Raw Elements, which worked great for me. Unfortunately, that sunscreen made a list of sunscreens that had benzene in it (Google this, it’s factual).  I found this one after a lot of searching & have to say that it’s equivalent to Raw Elements, minus the cancer-causing benzene. I recently used it, applying to face, neck, chest and my forearms, leaving my upper arms free of any protection because I was wearing a shirt.  I changed into my swimsuit about 6 hrs later, forgetting to apply sunscreen to my upper arms and upper back. My mistake, although painful, showed that this sunscreen worked great, as the areas I applied it hours before did not burn, but the rest of me was quite red. And I was swimming and floating in the pool for a couple hours.  Of note, I did not reapply this sunscreen, relying on the initial application to cover me. One “con” that some folks may not like is that it does give a white “sheen” to your skin (from the zinc), that does fade after a while. But it’s worth it to me because of my sensitive skin.  Finally: no hives!! No breakouts!!  This is now my new go-to sun protection.

Hands down the best natural sunscreen we’ve ever used! We are from northern Indiana so not much skin exposed to the sun during winter time. We were all very white, my husband, our 4 year old and myself. We went to Florida for vacation and were on the beach a lot and in the full sun. This stuff performed AMAZINGLY! We only had to apply once and it literally lasted ALL day, even though we were in the water, sand, etc. Very waterproof and AMAZING sun protection. We didn’t get burnt at ALL. It isn’t too thick like some zinc sunscreens either. Spreads very easily on the skin. You can rub it in completely too so there’s no white cast showing and it works perfectly. You don’t have to look white for it to work. It made my skin look so glowing and moisturized. It is a tiny bottle though and mine arrived with a big slice in the bottle and sunscreen everywhere. I didn’t have time to order another one before we left on our trip so I just taped it shut over the cut and it worked fine. But maybe a little better packaging would help! 100% ordering again and so glad to finally have found a good, safe and affective sunscreen for the whole family!!

Non greasy does not leave white residue. I bought it for face. If it's really non nano and will protect from uv rays then this is the sun screen i have been looking for.

I use sunscreen whenever I go outside and have tried many different products. The mineral ones tend to be annoyingly thick but Babo is not, so I have finally found the perfect solution that provides high SPF protection and minerals. It is reasonably priced and I will be buying this again.

Loved this sunscreen. Used it on my husband, myself, and my 2 year old and it worked perfectly. It was a particularly sunny weekend and I needed something that would cover the entire family- this did the trick. My son has very sensitive skin and this sunscreen did not irritate him.

I love the way this lotion glides on the face and has a matte finish. I have super sensitive skin and find it difficult to find something that works for me. This is the best product that I have ever used! I love it!

Goes on smoothly, and doesn't have unhealthy chemicals like the cheaper brands.

This is a staple in our house for our little one. Is it a bit more expensive than a lot of the common brands? Yes, but worth it to have a clean, chemical free product on your kids skin.

Just a small amount goes a long way - I use this under makeup even. Does not feel sticky. Works great- haven’t burned yet in the south

Great stuff. Easy to apply. NOT greasy !

I like this sunscreen a lot, it is extremely gentle, creamy, not runny. S little white cast left, but I say to rub in.

Lightweaght and easy to apply

Love this sunblock!! Protects my little guy and easy to apply and rub in!

Its not sheer, its thick, but it does its job and protected my 10mo while in the water all day for 9 days!

I have sensitive skin and sunburn easily. Babo works great

I really this new light version! My kids skin doesn’t get all dry after using it every day all day long on the lake!

Gave me the best protection from the sun!

My first mineral sunscreen use from using chemical based ones. This sunscreen leaves a frightening white cast no matter how much I rub the product into my skin. Babo botanical should acknowledge brown skinned folks who wants sun protection with healthy ingredients. It is disappointing that I cannot return the product either. So be mindful of that when purchasing! I even contacted the company directly TWICE on their official site and they still have not answered me back! Buyers be aware

Bought this for our Hawaii trip since we were going to be playing in the ocean and wanted something safe for the waters. I liked that it felt light on the skin but it had a horrible smell. I didn’t think to test it before flying out and I didn’t want to go out and buy a new one so we were stuck with it. My family did not get sunburned and we were out half the days, so that’s a good thing. But I just could not get over the smell. It was also hard to scrub off in the shower at the end of the day. The smell just kind of lingered.

eos-eos

So my kids have eczema and I was looking for a gentle sunscreen that doesn’t hurt their skin. I’ve used Babo before and been happy, and I’m pleased with this product as well. It’s easier to rub in than other sunscreens and doesn’t burn their skin. Only down side is the smell. It does not smell great. I don’t know how to explain it…. Not quite earthy smelling, but similar. It’s kinda stinky. That being said, if you don’t super care about that them I recommend! I would get it again and suffer the smell in my hands haha

eos-eos

While in the sun I feel protected. The sun does not feel very harsh on my skin. I am black so when I applied the sunscreen it looked white so I had to do some extra work to rub it into my skin so that it didn't look too white but there was a little white cast. I do not like the smell of it though. I think it stinks. I had to use perfume to tone down the smell.

eos-eos

This product takes getting used to. I hated the thick consistency and the smell when I first started using it. However the smell goes away quickly. I found that if I get my hands wet first and rub the sunscreen into my fingers a lot before putting it on my face, it applies more evenly and doesn’t feel as sticky.I haven’t broken out and it doesn’t make me look greasy. I would recommend.

I have been searching for a good, reef safe mineral sunscreen for my rosacea and acne-prone skin. I did not experience any reactions, as I do have sensitive skin. Unfortunately, I did not like this brand as much as other mineral sunscreens. The consistency is very thick, almost like glue, so it is very difficult to rub in. It does leave a noticeable white cast (which is expected for most mineral sunscreens), but I have very fair skin so it probably would be even more noticeable on deeper skin tones. However, the sun protection was effective when applied as directed. Overall, I wanted to like this sunscreen due to the price, but if you are looking for a quality cosmetic sunscreen that looks good on the skin I would suggest something different.

doesn t stay white on skin

I wasn’t a fan of how this smelt or how it felt on my face. It has a very chalky feel…went to return it and it says ineligible for returns. Go to the item description again to see if it states that and it says “Eligible for returns or replacements” until you click on it and it says only if damaged or defective. So before you buy on here I would just go in a store and make sure you like the way it smells and feels.

Didn’t survive the sun in Fiji. Even with an application once an hour we still all got burnt badly. It’s like it didn’t work at all.

eos-eos

I have this product in the spray form and I really like it, so I tried buying it in the lotion form. When I open the package, it had exploded all over and this item is an eligible for return or replacement… So that’s frustrating.

eos-eos

Love that this sunscreen blends in and doesn’t make my skin look white but it makes me incredible hot which I guess is the same with all mineral sunscreens.

Seems to work ok but didn’t really care for the smell of it

Our family recently started using babo products and were pleased with their natural ingredients. However, we won’t be supporting this company with our money any more because of their recent stance on family. Ironic really, since they champion themselves as a family company.

Does not rub in and product came with the bottle sticky and looking dirty. Not a fan.

I could even return it ! Horrible smell , it seen to be expired

Expected to be able to return once I found the tube was busted open. EXTREMELY disappointed that this is not an option. It is unusable as is. Can not be stored with a broken/open/leaking tube.

Super greasy, sticky and leaves a white cast. Takes 2-3 washes to take it off my face! Very sticky and tacky. Cannot return the product. So that’s the biggest drawdown. Useless product and waste of my hard earned money!!

I received a damage product! And there is no one to talk to!!! Waste of money!!!!!

It came opened the package must have gotten to hot or something it exploded all over my other items

The scent is horrible. It smells like it went bad!

It seems like "mineral based" is the new buzzword in sunscreens as we try to avoid putting chemicals on our skin. This is my new favorite sunscreen... it goes on thick but rubs in quickly, has no scent and does a great job blocking the sun. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended!!!

Bought this to use on 10mo. old nephew I nanny x2 a week.. his mama is pure Icelandic - dad is 100% African. A skin type mixing the palest and darkest of opposite ends! Needless to say- I didn’t want to take any chances with this beautiful baby.. not certainly a baby I’ve been entrusted to take care of and keep safe! Not sure why but sunburns on other people’s kiddos while in your care are so much worse.. are they not!!?  Myself being Icelandic.. I also know the struggle with our sensitive skin issues. I wanted an organic and “of the earth” product for his newborn skin.. this performed exceptionally well causing zero rash or, irritation.. which was impressive in 100° temp. Of course, we kept baby in minimal direct sun exposure (we applied sunscreen prior to leaving house and x2 touch ups applications poolside.. during a 4.5hr period.) I included photographs showing skin and then, afterwards- it’s darkended up but, without sunburn!  Full disclosure: I did use a special facial stick for his face- and Boba botanicals on his head neck and extremities.. happy baby, happy nanny!! I recommend for anyone with highly sensitive skin issues… This isn’t a sunscreen I’d share in bulk at a kids birthday party- I know!! Sold at $10-$16 for 3oz. It’s sold at a higher price point than major brands- and one I’d purchase again in the future.. it performed that well! I hope this info can help in your decision- stay safe! Photo show baby legs post use- no rash, no burn!!

There are two coral-safe chemicals for sunscreen: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The later is not as safe on our skin and actually ages us faster. Zinc Oxide is what this is made from. It's the best possible chemical you could use to protect yourself, your kids and the sea life! This brand sells a spray on version but it contains the Titanium Dioxide, so stick with this version!  Aside from the chemistry lesson, this is as not sheer like it claims. It's actually white and it doesn't fully absorb so that your skin ends up clear when done. BUT it's so much safer on you!  As someone with a chronic skin condition from overexposure to a product with a dioxide in it, I plead with you to do your research and pay attention to what chemicals sit on your skin and your kids' skin. THIS ONE is a GOOD ONE!

Our whole family including a toddler has been using this sunscreen for a few days now and no one has gotten a sunburn, so that’s a win right there. We used it in the water too and reapplied after being in the pool for about an hour. This sunscreen has a lightweight texture and is easy to apply. It absorbs well and quickly, which is a must with my squirmy toddler. It is fragrance free. It doesn’t leave the skin greasy or sticky. It may leave minimal white cast, which can be further worked into the skin by massaging it in. Our whole family likes this natural sunscreen and recommends it.

Babo Botanicals is one of the few sunscreens that my family can use. My kids got their father's ultra sensitive Irish skin, so sunscreen is something we have a lot of around here. We have to be super careful with the types we buy, so that no one has a reaction. I love that Babo Botanicals uses plant based ingredients like organic calendula flower extract, natural coconut oil, sunflower seed oil and shea butter. They also use non-nano zinc oxide and never add in the harsh chemicals and additives that other brands do. It moisturizes your skin and makes it feel healthier, while still protecting you from the harmful UVA and UVB rays. It's lightweight, easy to apply and soaks right into your skin. It is more expensive than the other name brands mass manufactured sunscreens, but it's 100% worth it!!

I have fair, sensitive skin, so I have to be careful about the product that I use on my skin. I am also trying to be more mindful about using less chemicals, so a mineral-based sunscreen with a high SPF is kind of the best of both worlds.  This sunscreen seems to work well. It is pretty easy to dispense, apply to my skin, and rub in. It doesn't really have a strong scent, which I appreciate, and it doesn't really leave a strong film or color on my skin. There is definitely still a bit of a whiteness on my skin, but this is typical of more natural, higher SPF sunscreens.  I reapply often, especially when using it in the water, but so far, I have not experienced any sunburns with it. That is great!  It is a bit more expensive than typical sunscreen, but you just have to decide if it's worth it to invest the money if you want something more natural. I recommend this product overall.

The Babo Botanicals sheer mineral sunscreen lotion SPF 50 is physical screen and good for my son senstivie skin. I like it without any scent and a tube has 3oz could use for family every member. The sheer formulate could not brush the white the skin and easy to apply. The skin after use is very moisturized without greasy. The sunscreen contains 20% zinc oxide, and lotion is very light and thin and good for the face or body skin, I like it has 80 minutes water resistant. Package: 5stars Liquid content: 4 stars Moisturizing: 5 stars Comfort/ no allergies: 5 stars Active sunscreen ingredient: zinc oxide 20% Non- greasy: 5 stars Perfume: None

We have been using ThinkBaby sunscreen for years and it's still my go-to for the kids (6 and 3). However, I think I might like this Babo Botanicals sunscreen better! It is not as thick and goes on more smoothly so it's easier to apply. It's a little more expensive, but the smaller-sized tube is also great for keeping in a purse, backpack, or diaper bag. We have to send a tube to preschool with my daughter and it's a good size to keep in her backpack. I really like that it is fragrance free and mineral and it's been great for us so far.

Review for: Babo Botanicals Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 with 100% Mineral Active Ingredients - for Babies, Kids or Extra Sensitive Skin - Lightweight, Water Resistant & Fragrance Free - 3 fl. oz.  I have been using this product when outside gardening. It does it’s job of protecting me from burning. The sunscreen is easy to apply. It squeezes out of the tube easily without forcing you to take more product than I want. While it is white, I do not get a white cast when I apply it. I massage it in a bit and am ready to go. I also don’t find it sticky at all.

- I like the natural ingredients and so far comfortable for my skin - I like the it has certified B Corp , gives me confidence of their focus on environment and quality - scent is light and pleasant - effective for me

Used with multiple applications throughout the day and didn't get burnt. Isn't greasy either or have that usual sun block smell.

We use this for summer vacation because it was a small container. It's very lightweight and thin without being greasy. It also doesn't leave any white residue. While we did not get any sunburn, we still got noticeably tanned. I don't mind being tan and was happy that no one got burned.

As a pale person, I need sunscreen on every inch of my body when the UV index gets any higher than 3. My kid is the same way and I needed a product safe for kids and won't irritate her skin. This product seems to satisfy the requirements that I need. SPF 50, mineral based and hypoallergenic. The product applied smoothly and was not greasy or tacky. There was also no scent.
