I’m what I call a natural French fry in the sun due to my natural red head complexion. Being stuck inside on beautiful days isn’t fun. I love Beach Bum products as I don’t burn! If it is sunscreen I’ve tried them all. Even 70+ Sunscreen that didn’t work and after an hour I’d be a French fry. Half of the other kinds would attract a sun burn and the spots I missed would be fine. Like a chemical burn. I’d given up until a friend told me about this brand! When I do burn the cooling spray is amazing by the way. The only thing that helped previously was shredded raw potatoes on burns, but took 2 people and was messy. Being allergic to so many things; this has been a godsend! I now get to love my time in or on lakes and rivers in the Midwest! Love this product!!

I liked the scent and how well the sunscreen protected. My new favorite. Went on light and not sticky even though I tend to put on a lot of sunscreen at once. Didn’t irritate my skin.

Like how it doesn’t make your skin feel like you have sunscreen on or have oily/slimy skin.

Pricey but loves the smell. Bought this because of neutragena recall

Best we have found for sun protection

I love sun bum products! My daughter has really sensitive skin and this works great and smells amazing!

Feel this product gives good coverage for hours in the sun. No goopy residue when it is time to reapply.

Gluten free! Great for people with Celiac disease. And smells so good, I could eat it.

I love this product and it works while having a lot less chemicals than most brands

We love Sun Bun products! They are pricey, but have protected my kids' skin from being burned and it smells great. We love that it is free of a lot of nasty ingredients like other sunscreens.

Love this product, but was disappointed that one bottle would not spray at all. It was a bummer having to track down a place while on vacation to get this brand.

I used this mostly for reapplications. It does the job.

I bought this for vacation, and felt confident because other Sun Bum products I tried have been so amazing. Unfortunately, even though I applied, let it dry and reapplied every 1.5 hours, I got a terrible burn. To make it worse I am pretty sure it caused irritation/chemical burn on my legs. Afraid to use it again. Guess I will stick to mineral lotions.

it worth the price

This is garbage. I applied this probably 15 times over the course of a day, and this is the result. I wish I could get a refund.

Description is misleading when searching for Reef safe sunscreen.

The spray mechanism stopped working so I looked it up online. Many others have had the same issue and recommended I contact the company. Sun Bum responded-- telling me I could only return it to the reseller. Since it is Amazon and past the 30 day window, I'm stuck with half a can of useless product. Knowing this happens often (enough), I won't buy this again.

Too much coconut smell.

I was unable to get the cans to spray and they are not eligible for return. A waste!

Arrived smashed. So strange since it’s a tough bottle it had to really have been smashed under something. Item says it’s not returnable.

Cannot use this in the USVI. It is not reef-safe.

I love sun bum products. You don't get the chemical smell like other products. It smells very typically and coconut like. Easy to apply. Great sun coverage. Their products are reef safe which is important And also vegan, and cruelty free, and most importantly on the recommend list from the skin cancer foundation.

I’m so fair, freckles are a tan! Sun Bum works great to lessen my chances of a sunburn. I use it at the beach and pool and reapply, but not as strict as every 2 hours. It’s been great sun protection and smells great too! I use the spray for body and Sun Bum lotion for face. It doesn’t break me out either, and I have sensitive skin.

Loved it and definitely will use sun bum again

I live in Phoenix Arizona! Triple digits temps for months! A lot of sun here! Short answer well it works. Follow the directions! Apply and let dry. If youre swimming you'll need to reapply! Common sense! And you aren't getting all the extra toxic cancer causing ingredients that are in most sunblock.

I have three small kids below 7 yes old. This is hands down our preferred brand of spray sunscreen. This spray is a fine but strong mist that works great. We also pray into our hands to apply to kids faces and the consistency works great for that also. Smell is 100%!!

The ingredients in this product are banned in the U.S. Virgin Islands because they are damaging to coral reefs.  Reef safe ingredients are zinc/zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.
