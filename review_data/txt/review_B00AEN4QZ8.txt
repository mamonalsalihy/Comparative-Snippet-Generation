An excellent product we did not burn with it after being in the sun The product protects the skin

Second summer using this sun screen cause it works so well. It absorbs into skin easily and protects great. Just came back from a week long camping fishing trip where I spent 95% of the time outdoors. I'd typically apply in the morning when getting dressed and again around 3pm before going back out on the boat til sun down. No sun burn, no peeling skin. This one bottle was enough for me and my boyfriend for the week. He didn't use as much as I did but we still have some left over.

This sun screen goes on so easily and when I apply it on my face, it doesn’t look white, and it doesn’t leak into my eyes! Makes it easy to apply every morning as part of my getting going ritual.

It's a good Sunscreen but if you don't want to look greasy for a everyday use don't use it. It's perfect for the beach or a hot pool day I would honestly say. I have really sensitive skin and I use it every night for my face, since it's too oily for the day time

I was surprised 70 spread as easy as 50. I need the protection from the sun so I will switch too 70.
