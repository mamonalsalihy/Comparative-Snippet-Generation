I will be switching to this product exclusively after my use of it during the Ally 400 in Nashville on June 20th. It was a very sunny day and there was little shade at all. I am a natural born redhead with very sunburn prone skin and this sunscreen kept me 100% burn free. It was a 110¬∞F day at the track and humidity was high so yes, I was overheating. But I did not burn. As any natural ginger can tell you, that's a pretty hard thing to accomplish. It is important to apply as directed to get maximum protection, of course. I applied more often because of sweat. My only complaint would have to be the odor but considering that only lasts a few moments and the protection lasts literally all day, that's a very minor issue.

I've never used a spray sunscreen before, and I was pleasantly surprised by this one. At first though, I wasn't impressed. If you spray it too far away, it'll go on your skin and anywhere else around you...too close and it goes on too thick. I go with the latter, then smooth it into the area of skin surrounding that spot. If you choose to do it this way, spray everywhere on one half of your body where you'll need protection from the sun, avoiding your palm. Smooth it around using only the hand with which you used to spray. SPF100 tells you the amount of time you're able to stay safely in the sun without burning, past the time it usually takes to burn. For example, if your skin will burn in 15 minutes, this product will give you an additional 100 minutes to spend in the sun...ie: almost 2 hours. So buy this level of SPF if you're looking to have to reapply less frequently. *I did price it out, and the 2-pack of Banana Boat SPF50 costs about the same as this does. So, those 2 cans will equal the same amount of time you're able to spend safely in the sun as this one can will allow. Commonsense will tell you that this one is the best value ;)

I wore this when I went on vacation and never burned whereas the much tanner people still did wearing an spf 60! As a pale redhead from the north, I can honestly say this is now my fave sunblock! It goes on well and is NOT greasy at all and dries so fast! Usually sunblock is greasy and makes me break out but not this one. 10$ is also a super fair price and you can get several full body applications. Redhead approved!üë©‚Äçü¶∞üëå‚úÖ

Best sunscreen ever!!! I only use 100spf sunscreen and this is the best so far and it has aloe vera in it which I love! I am an African american female with a skin tone NC45 and I put this on exposed areas only when I go outside and take it with me to put on more every 2 hours. I'm one of those lucky ladies where I dont get a pretty darkened complexion. Ive seen women who get darker in the sun and it gives them a darkened red tone and a darker tan color . When I darken I only darken in certain areas and stay lighter in other areas which gives me an obvious look of discoloration. I never just get darker all over my body its only in certain areas and it looks like I'm dirty or something so everytime I go outside in the sun I put this sunscreen on and try to stay out the sun as much as possible and my skin has improved a lot!!!

We are from Florida, so we know just how important sunscreen is. That said, we had brought an SPF 50 with us to the Bahamas and still ended up getting very red - even with plenty of reapplication. I bought this one to take with us to Mexico to try to avoid any sunburns. We may have actually come back with less of a tan than we started with - LOL - which was fine by us. We wore this on the cruise ship on the sun deck and at an excursion where we were in full sun ALL DAY LONG. We reapplied once on the excursion. You may need to reapply more if you‚Äôre in the water, but we had no burns at all. Very happy with this sunscreen.

Goes on easy, doesn't leave your skin greasy. I even rub it all over with my hands and don't immediately need to wash my hands because they're not sunscreen-grimy. Protects my skin like nothing else and doesn't sweat off easily. I don't feel it on my skin, it's so airy. Smell isn't the best but it's still pleasant and short-lived, and thank goodness it's on the fresh side rather than that warm, almost tropical smell other sunscreens sometimes have. Blech.  The holy grail of sun protection, imo. I will never waste money on other sunscreens; they all inevitably disappoint me after this one.

If you are bald and burn easily, then this is a great product for you. I drive a semi during the day, and am in and out of the truck all day long. I use it on my bald head and my arm that faces the open side window on the driver's side of the truck. I apply it in the morning and it lasts all day long. I don't burn and I end up tanning very evenly. I've used this product for over a decade. It's light, clear, and non-greasy compared to other products.

I'm very, very pale with very sensitive skin that get irritated by almost any lotion - especially ones listed as 'for sensitive skin.' I am always searching for a sunscreen I can slather on that doesn't irritate my skin. I found this product a few years ago and it works pretty good. I've tried it in a few strengths but the 110 is best for me. Without sunscreen I can start to burn in 10 minutes.  It does work. I've worn it out in the desert at high altitudes all day in full sun and have come back with no color - just the way I like it. :-) I've also worn it swimming a few times lately - I apply just before getting in the water and just after. So far, it's been working. Very pleased.  The button is a little awkward until you get used to it. Initially, I thought you rocked/tilted the button and I always struggled to get any spray to come out. I finally realized you press straight down - now it's not a problem. It can get a little awkward doing it left handed - so it does require a little strength - but not that much. So, maybe not so good if you have arthritis or other hand issues.  Since it is a spray - it's fairly easy to get it on my own back - so that is a plus for sports, etc when you don't necessarily have a friend around to help you apply it to the hard to reach areas. Even after spraying, I always make sure to rub it around for any areas I can reach. Also, you can get it to 'spray' so just air comes out and no sunscreen. So, when using it, make sure there's actually liquid coming out - if it isn't - just reposition and press again. I wonder if that is why someone got burned using this?? Same issue with any aerosol - so just use your common sense here. Something needs to come out for it to work. ;-)  Best thing is that it isn't very irritating to the skin. Yes, I still would rather NOT be wearing it but it doesn't give me a rash like some sunscreens do. And, it doesn't feel quite as pour clogging as lotion sunscreens do. Not sure it is because of the Aloe - or if I'm just taken in by the marketing - but I will take what I can get. I can reapply many times and not get totally grossed out by it on my skin.

This sunscreen truly is not greasy. It is dry once applied. I spray amount in my hand then apply to my face. The rest of my body just spray directly. It doesn't matter how close or far you hold the bottle to spray. It's a personal preference. I have sensitive facial skin. It doesn't sting my face. It has a very light scent that dissipates. It's not like the old tanning lotions that smelled like tropical oil or coconut lotion all day. If people think this smells or has a heavy scent they weren't around in the 1970s and 1980s !!!

After reading in Consumer Reports that this was the top rated sunscreen, I bought several spray bottles to use when was at Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert for 10 days. I spent a lot of time in the sun and, with two applications/day this sunblock worked spectacularly well. I never burned and, after 10 days, only got a very mild tan. My skin had no adverse reaction to the spray (this is not to say that yours won't) and the smell was not pronounced. This was a very challenging environment with regard to the extreme amount of sun and this spray came through with flying colors. Highly recommended.

I will never buy another sunblock for myself. I've always struggled with burning, even with diligent reapplication, but this is a miracle in a can. I used it in full sun at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas where I was in the water with fully exposed arms, shoulders, and back for 5 hours and only got a little pink (and only because I didn't want to leave the water to reapply.) I used it generously so I did go through a whole bottle and some just in that day but for the price it is worth having none of the pain of sunburn. My husband who tans easily used some so he wouldn't burn and commented that he loved that he didn't feel sticky or slimy!

eos-eos

I have always heard that anything over 50 SPF doesn‚Äôt really offer any more protection but my husband still burns with 50 due to a medication he takes. Tried this out of desperation and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked on our recent tropical vacation. Will definitely be ordering more, but wish all sunscreens would move to reef friendly.

Mine shipped as SPF 110, not 100 as shown in the image. Good stuff for here in the Caribbean - no tanning, no burns, no skin irritations, no bad scent (it does have a fragrance though). Skin does feel slightly slick after application, and you do look a tad shiny. As with most of these sprays, they don't seem to be pressurized enough to give decent coverage - I have to constantly shake and hold it upside down while spraying for best results.

eos-eos

I am a super pale redhead so I am always great about applying sunscreen. This worked great. Had a pool day while on vacation in Tennessee. It sprayed on really well and kept me very protected while in the pool. Didn't stay out too long so I didn't need to reapply. And my skin was not sunburn at all.

eos-eos

We used a brand before that got recalled but my husband suffers from over 50% burn from a fire so sun protection is an absolute must for him. I tried several other 100 spfs when our last go to got recalled. This was by far the best we keep 3-5 cans in the house through the summer.

I originally bought this for my trip to the beach next month.. decided to put it too test this past weekend considering all our events were outdoors.. I put it on every part of my body, except for my calf‚Äôs cause I had capris on and didn‚Äôt think much of it.... my calf‚Äôs are the only thing that got sunburned. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I applied every 45-60mins.

I use this on my trip to Panama City Beach and I never received sunburn this is the first time that I actually found a good product that works in last and it‚Äôs very easy to apply

I have sensitive skin so I struggle finding sunscreen that protects my skin from sunburn without making me breaking out in acne. This did not irritate my skin like other sunscreens have. This has a lightweight formula and I like using the spray because it goes on evenly and its faster to apply. Will buy again.

I am very fair skin and burn very quickly. Its been hard to find a sunscreen that stands up to the Florida sun, but this sunscreen has been great! Both times I've used it at the pool and beach it has been great and truly protected me from getting burned unlike some other SPF 100 products I've tried. I highly recommend if you burn easy!

My granddaughter has pure white skin no matter what so good sunblock is a must for her. This product works best so far I have found for her and outlasts all the others including prescription!

The Caribbean is where I want to be.  I often settle for a good pool or beach right here in the east where I live.  I am older and take medications for which I must protect myself from the sun and of course sun burn or sun poisoning or Melanoma.  This does it all at 110 SPF.  It goes on in a spray so easily and neatly. No rubbing in or rubbing on. Simply spray.  This makes it so very easy to re apply. Its just NO FUSS.  Top of the line here on protection.

I like that it is a spray and it's high UV rating. Didn't know they come this high till a friend went to the Bahamas and told me about it!!!  Unlike other sunscreen lotions in a bottle, because this isn't exposed to the air, you don't have to throw out any unused after a year like the lotions recommend you do!! Application is easy and lasts a long time, just remember to re-apply after exercise or swimming!

Worked as described. Visited a sunny and hot area recently. Used the sunscreen daily, applying generously. All the while did not get burned even though was exposed to the sun for hours a day over several days.

I purchased specificly for my face an feet. Worked perfectly. No sunburn on my feet - no tanlines from sandals and no sunburned peeling skin on my face. Love this product. Spray bottle works great easy use and lock. I applied to my face by spraying on my hand and then rubbing on my face That way it was even coverage. Will purchase product again. Recommend especially for fair skin.

I am very fair skinned , so usually I can‚Äôt stay out long . Most sunscreens don‚Äôt do much for me and im all sticky and sweaty .

Get this if you are worried about applying sunscreen and then breaking out. It is not greasy, dries fast, and I had no issue with breakouts after using it all day, multiple times a day, in 100+ degree heat weather in Mexico. And no sunburn

I just used it today and maybe its all in my head but I really felt protected by the suns harmful rays...lol...but maybe I haven't been looking in the wrong stores but I can't find sunscreens that go up to 110. So I was pretty happy when I found it online. Will mos def buy this product again from this seller.
