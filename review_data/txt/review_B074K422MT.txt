I learned about this product from Angie (HotandFlashy Youtuber). I loved the lightweight consistency and started using it daily for about 3 weeks. After a couple of days I started getting sensitive skin (skin itching around the jawline and cheekbones, tender, etc.). Then after about 2 weeks, I noticed that my skin was getting dark patches around the cheek area. I kept thinking it was my Curology cream that I was using. But I had been using it for about 3 weeks prior to starting this sunscreen with no issues so I kept telling myself it must be something else not wanting to believe that it was this highly rated sunscreen. After I researched it more thoroughly, I realized that it has bergamot fruit oil found in this sunscreen. This ingredient can cause skin to be extra sensitive to the sun which can lead to dark spots. I was horrified but it made sense because that's what was happening to me. I immediately stopped using it and within a day my skin stopped itching and being sensitive. Unfortunately my dark spots are still there. I absolutely do not recommend this for sensitive skin. There's no real benefit from having the bergamot oil in this product other than to make it smell nice. But fragrance is not good for the skin. I recommend you watching Dr. Dray's review of this product.

So there is a lot of upset people over the reformulation and size change and I get that if you are sensitive to chemical sunscreens you would be upset. However there is a reason it was reformulated and with the recent Korean sunscreen test scandals this sunscreen was like 1 of 5 to have passed with flying colors. It also does not contain a certain ingredient that actually would cause skin to be more sensitive and could lead to dark spots from the sun. So if you can handle chemical sunscreens get this. Feels like nothing and has 0 smell!

I try to take very good care of my fair/light 32 year-old skin and i was worried about the formula change because I LOVED the old formula. But I have to say, this stuff is great. We are having a major heat wave in the Pacific northwest right now. 116 degrees today and I wore this in the pool for hours and NO SUNBURN! I barely even have tan lines!! I will note that this is not marketed as water resistant and I was worried about using it in the water, but I found that it did protect me and my kids well and we reapplied every 45 min-1hr. My husband even asked me what sunscreen I was using because I wasn't burning. I do apply and reapply often and liberally. Generous amount in bottle for a sunscreen, although I don't like the decreased amount with this new formulation. I didn't experience any stinging in my eyes with this new formula. I use this on my kids as well. There is an extremely faint white cast on the body, but it's only minimally noticable after rubbing it in. I wear makeup so I don't see it on the face and it doesn't disrupt makeup or break me out. I use an oil cleanser to fully remove. I wish this was still purely mineral, but this does an excellent job when used as directed!

Unfortunately, as of June 2021, the Sun Ray Fluid is no more. Instead, another reformulation made this sunscreen a physical-chemical combo. Zinc Oxide was removed replaced by chemical sunscreen. The size also changed from 200 ml to 150 ml. I wished MakeP:rem just introduced a second sunscreen fluid and not replaced a great product. I can no longer recommend this product...sigh.  Original Review: NEW FORMULA: same great SPF protection but without bergamot essential oils! I used this sunscreen about 4 years ago when Make:Prem discontinued my favorite sunscreen cream (orange bottle which I loved!) but I sometimes itch right after application especially when I'm having eczema flare-ups, so I gave it to my sister who loved it. After using a sample from another seller last December, I realized that this new formulation is different! I don't really smell any fragrance but most importantly, I have no reactions (itchiness or bumps) even when I used it while having an eczema flare-upüòç I looked at the ingredients and saw that they removed a lot of the allergens. This is still easy to apply, works well on top of moisturizers and under make-up, and protects me fr the glaring Lalaland sun. The size is also very economical. Very happy!

Love love love this stuff! It's thin enough to spread very easily and at first it looks a little shiny and greasy with a little white cast mostly around edges of application area, but in about 10 minutes it sinks into my skin and turns super matte almost like a primer. It stays that way the whole day. I've had no issues with sun spots or tanning/burning since I began using this. My skin is normal with a very slightly oily T zone, and occasional dry spots. The sun fluid does not emphasize flaky spots like some sunscreens do. It doesn't clump, pill or peel, doesn't flake or transfer. It's nearly perfect. It could be more moisturizing, as it might not feel great on very dry skin, and it does have a light fragrance that disappears almost immediately, but may bother those who are sensitive. It does not contain bergamot oil any more, which used to be an issue for some.

THEY CHANGED THE OLD FORMULA WHICH WAS 5 STARS FOR ME, IT WAS MY MOST FAVORITE SUNSCREEN THAT I HAD EVER FOUND, IT WENT ON LIKE THE LIGHTEST SILK AND WAS COMPLETELY MINERAL-BASED WITH NO CAST WHATSOEVER. AND IT CAME IN A 6.76 BOTTLE THAT LASTED ME LIKE 4 MONTHS FOR BOTH MY BODY AND FACE. NOW THEY HAVE NOT ONLY DOWNGRADED THE SIZE TO A STUPID 5.07 OUNCE, THEY HAVE ALSO ADDED CHEMICAL FILTERS IN THEIR ONCE PERFECT FULLY-PHYSICAL FORMULA. I CAME ON HERE TO ORDER IT AGAIN, EXPECTING THE SAME PERFECT 6.76 OUNCE BOTTLE OF PERFECTLY FINE FORMULA, ONLY TO BE HEARTBROKEN, IN DESPAIR NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO ANYONE FOR TWO WEEKS. GOODBYE

I don‚Äôt do many reviews in general because not many products knock my socks off enough for me to post about it. But this sunscreen is probably the one I‚Äôll use moving forward. My skin is pretty normal, balanced. I am on tretinoin and it isn‚Äôt as reactive as it use to be in my 20s and 30s. On the Fitzpatrick scale I‚Äôm a IV, and I have no issues with this leaving a white cast. Dries down in 5 minutes and leaves not residue on my face mask. When I do have an attack of the dry peeelies from my tret, the sunscreen does settle into the dry skin and can be noticeable. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the products fault at all. It‚Äôs not enough of an issue for me to drop it.  LRP Anthelios line seems to be really popular and this by far blows that away in regards to texture, finish, smell, coverage, price‚Äî- all of it. Asian, specifically Korean, skincare lines just create more cosmetically elegant suncare. Full stop.

I really love this sunscreen for so many reasons: 1. It's PA++++ 2. It's a mineral sunscreen 3. If one applies the recommended 1/4 teaspoon on the face then it will leave a minimal white cast. The cast improves after 30-45 minutes but there will be a light cast. My skin color and tone is a light-medium. 4. It dries down in less than 20 min. 5. Price  The major negative for me is that it looks horrible under the IT illuminating CC cream and the Physician's Formula InstaReady Super BB cream. My skin looks like an orange peel around the mouth and chin area. In fairness, I've never tried applying any sunscreen under a CC/BB cream since I rarely wear them. Also, it can look a LITTLE chalky. When the sunscreen is re-applied it will look VERY chalky. Instead of re-applying the make Prem, I apply the Zealios sunscreen. It has zinc with a couple of chemical filters. I LOVE that it doesn't leave a white cast. It does leave the skin a little shiny but I don't mind it because it doesn't look too greasy. I used to think I had combo skin but since I've switched to a non-foamining cleanser (La Roche Posay Hydrating Cleanser) my skin feels normal. I ordered the make prem CREAM to see if the finish is better with and without a CC cream. I would definitely re-order unless the cream is better. My skin color is light to medium with olive undertones. I use light medium in the IT cosmetics light illuminating BB cream and N3 in the Loreal TruFace foundation.

My 3rd bottle of this stuff. I didn't know until my second bottle it is suitable for children also. I love how gentle it is on my childs skin as well as mine, how quickly it dries and sets, and how well it protects our skin, especially compared to physiscal sunscreens avaliable in america

eos-eos

I really like this product and it‚Äôs the second bottle I‚Äôve used and will again purchase. I like the light consistency in fact I just reapplied some over my make up and it looks fine. I have tried many sunscreens this past year and for me, especially for my face and neck, this works best. I‚Äôm in my late 60s with lots of sun damage showing up so I now never go a day without sun protection and this product is perfect for my needs. It also arrived next day even though I don‚Äôt have Prime. I was impressed by that as well. This is a true review by someone who normally would not take the time to leave an extensive review, but did so because I believe in sun protection.

I love this sunblock! It‚Äôs not thick, glides on nicely, and does not leave a white cast. I notice that it dries down matte and my skin remains like that all day (applied at 11am and It‚Äôs currently 9pm{I‚Äôm aware I needed to reapply after 2hrs but I only walked the dog at 11am and didn‚Äôt leave the house until his second walk which was after sunset}). My point is I haven‚Äôt had the need to blot or powder and my face isn‚Äôt tight from dryness either. I think this would be amazing under makeup as it essentially absorbs instantly and wouldn‚Äôt give a thick cakey look. I already ordered a second bottle (I have used sunblock daily since I was 11 years old) so when I find one I double down on it and mind u I always keep different types of sunblocks for different skin areas and time of year ..this one is now part of the family of staples. It‚Äôs pricey but not as much as department Store sunblocks and it‚Äôs much much larger when compared to those same sunblocks... I believe this to be totally worth it.

eos-eos

it doesn't really smell too strongly of a perfume at all which I like, it doesn't leave a white cast, it dries down matte feeling, and for my combo oily normal some areas are more sensitive, and this never breaks me out, UNLIKE other brands that have chemical sun protection this does not irritate! it's soothing to me like the last step of skin care before I leave the house. I work with kids so I'm always outside, it really helps control my facial freckles in the summer. it doesn't leave that gross greasy film feeling at all. I've bought this 2x already one bottle lasts me about a year and 4 months! summer time definitely a must! and I'm almost going to buy my 3rd again. I love it. I hope to have this for the rest of my life! I also used the samples it came with, I like the viscosity if the toner and how fast the toner sinks in, and I like the makeprem safeME too a normal sensitive skin cream lotion very nice, it's pretty moisturizing and calming. nice stuff! will def buy again. even if the price keeps going up and up and up, I'll buy it again and again!!! 10/10 def recommend.

First things first: the consistency. I hate thick sunscreens, but this is a sun fluid. It has a consistency of watery face creams. I knew it wasn't going to be thick because of the "sun fluid" part, but I didn't expect it to be like this! I didn't have to squeeze the bottle much at all for it to come out. It feels incredibly light on the skin, almost like you're not wearing anything at all. It's cosmetically elegant; it's beautiful under makeup (silicone or water-based). Another great thing is that it doesn't long to rub it in. I've used many types of sunscreens where it takes forever to rub into the skin. I didn't have this problem at all.  It's a bit pricy, but I think it's 100% worth it. 1) It hasn't broken me out. I have, somewhat, sensitive skin and it hasn't caused any problems at all! 2) There's no white cast. 3) Incredible formula & high protection. 4) It's NOT tacky and doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky like other products.  This is probably the BEST sunscreen/fluid I've ever used. The Korean (really Asian in general) suncare industry is way ahead of their western counterpart. Highly recommend this product!

eos-eos

Larger bottle than expected- bonus! Very fluid consistency with zero white cast. Soft, smooth texture on skin after application. Easy to apply makeup over product after it has dried (10-15 min). Happy customer and glad I hear about it online!

eos-eos

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. It does have a scent and I try to avoid fragrance in things I leave on my skin. The scent is a little like banana to me but it goes away really fast. I have very reactive skin and this doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. It is a matte finish which is great for me. But I do have to moisturize before applying or I feel a little dry. I don‚Äôt get any white cast from this but If you have dark skin it may not be quite as good but tolerable.

eos-eos

I bought this on recommendation from Hot and Flashy. It is really nice, applies easily and feels like nothing is there. I don't notice any white cast, but I am quite pale. I also use a tinted mineral sunscreen some days and that one feels like I have a thick layer of stuff on my face. If you are looking for something lighter in a mineral sunscreen that let's your natural skin shine through, pick this one.

eos-eos

I have never used sunscreen because it stung my face. Now, at age 67, I'm not liking the sun damage I see. I started using this product, as recommended by Angie of Hot and Flashy on YouTube, and I am so pleased. It is a light, nongreasy lotion. It does not burn or irritate my sensitive skin at all. It does not look white and can be worn with or without makeup. I intend to use this product daily and wish I had started years ago with sun protection.

eos-eos

Excellent!!!! However, this can slightly dry out the skin if you HAVE SKIN ON THE DRIER SIDE, so i would recommend wearing a moisturizer underneath if you have dry skin. I use this on my face, neck and decolletage. Hands too sometimes. It protects well and feels like really good quality. It does not cause any breakouts or reactions with my extremely sensitive skin and the scent is refreshing and very minimal (which is saying a lot because i usually loathe scented face products). It is easy to rub in, and goes under makeup extremely well. Does not feel sticky at all. Would recommend (already have) and buy again.

eos-eos

This is the best all mineral sunscreen I've tried. It goes on very light and almost watery and blends in easily. It's gentle enough to use on my face, and I have sensitive skin. It works well, typical SPF 50 protection. The selling point of this one and why I'm willing to pay more for it is it leaves almost no white cast and it's not greasy or slimy, and doesn't rub off on things like most other mineral based sunscreens do.

eos-eos

I was afraid to order this sunscreen because I have really dry skin, that‚Äôs made dryer by using tretinoin. I was very pleasantly surprised. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs moisturizing, but I can definitely say that it isn‚Äôt drying and is comfortable to wear all day. No problems wearing it under makeup. It has a slight chemically smell that dissipates quickly and it has a thin consistency, like Exuviance, which keeps it from appearing too white. I do wish it was tinted, but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. Huge bottle, so I‚Äôm loving that! Much better value than the pricey half dozen I use every day in rotation.

This stuff is amazing. I have melasma so I have to make sure I wear sunscreen everyday, even in the house. This stuff is so light weight and is great under makeup. It does not feel heavy or cakey and does not effect the wear of my makeup. This is my go to for sunscreen and love the fact that you get so much product. I wear everyday and the recommended amount (quarter of a teaspoon) or even a bit more and it has lasted me close to six months. I also love the fact that this will protect me from other harmful rays as well. Great for sensitive, or break out prone skin. Won't leave that ugly white cast.

eos-eos

I love the sunscreen - it's lasted me such a long time. Also, it's very moisturizing and doesn't leave a white cast. I have a dry skin type so those with oily skin may find this product a bit too oily. It's very watery consistency so it's super easy to apply and performs well under makeup. Loved the deluxe samples of the toner and the creams. The toner is a bit too fragrant for my taste but its very hydrating - you almost don't need a moisturizer afterwards. The cream is very moisturizing and perfect for any skin type, especially sensitive skin. I carried the toner and the cream for travelling and it was all I needed for skincare.

This is reliable stuff, great consistency and no grease or stickiness at all. Not too drying, just comfortably matte finish. The biggest plus is that it never burns my eyes! I tried many other products and they all burned my eyes to some degree, more or less. But this doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll hold onto this product as long as it‚Äôs available.

I love this moisturizer and sunscreen combo. It is the best I have ever tried at age 53. I purchased because a you tube influencer recommended and she was correct. It goes on underneath your makeup very easily. It acts as a moisturizer, sunblock and primer all in one. My makeup looks terrific by the end of the day. I have never experienced anything like this. I was told it keeps makeup flawless and I am a believer. Please never stop making this face sunscreen!!

THIS SUNSCREEN IS THE BOMB. Nobody is trying to get sunspots, premature wrinkles and nobody is trying to have their foundation look wack after a few hours. I used obaji matte, coola matte sunscreen before and I thought I liked those... this sunscreen is lightweight and a tad greasy right when you put it on but after a few min the finish is perfect. Makeup wears really well over this sunscreen. It's a big bottle so it will last a long time. LOVE LOVE LOVE

Was looking for an everyday mineral screen with low cast for body. Recommended by Angie on Hot and Flashy. Good sunscreen. Does leave a bit of a dull matte finish that‚Äôs not particularly flattering, but I‚Äôm ok with that.  Spent a week in Florida during COVID, wearing masks an average of 8 hours per day in the sun. My son, who has never had a negative reaction to chemical sunscreen, got a rash on the first day where the mask covered the sunscreen. Switched to this sunscreen for him and the rash subsided within a couple of days. Would recommend for sensitive skin.

I really like this sunscreen. I first discovered it on Glow Recipe's online site before they moved exclusively to Glow Recipe products. I like the high SFP rating and blue light protection. The application is lovely, very light and not hazy or grainy like some sunscreen. It also feels quite moisturizing. I use a moisturizer underneath but like how this sunscreen maintains that same dewiness. Some people may find it to dewy, but it works for my combination dehydrated skin quite nicely. I'm able to apply makeup on over it fine. Highly recommend.

My skin is somewhat sensitive and I prefer to use a mineral sunscreen, but I don‚Äôt care for the white cast that mineral sunscreens leave. This product leaves no cast whatsoever! It‚Äôs also very non-irritating.  This sunscreen works well with my makeup as well. If anything, my makeup seems to last longer with this sunscreen underneath.  This is my second purchase of this sunscreen and I will purchase again.

This is the best sunscreen I have used for my face. Most facial sunscreens are too heavy, leave a white sheen and don‚Äôt do well under makeup. This one is great on all counts. It almost has a primer effect to it. My skin is somewhat dry so I use a moisturizer over it, but moisturizer under it would be fine as well. Very nice sunscreen.

This is my favorite mineral sunscreen that I've tried (coppertone pure and simple, think baby, aveeno baby, Australian gold tinted). This is so easy to spread, doesn't leave a white cast, doesnt sting my eyes, and dries down quickly without drying me out (looking at you, Australian gold), and works great under makeup! Great everyday sunscreen  This one does have bergamot oil, though, so those extremely sensitive skinned folks might beware. But I didn't find it overpowering at all. Quite pleasant! Wish it was a little less expensive, and waterproof üòÑ

I have used many different sunscreens, both physical and chemical and expensive brands, and this by far is the best. It absorbs quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast behind. It gives my skin a nice healthy glow and doesn‚Äôt make my sensitive skin red or irritated. It provides the best UV protection and I feel very protected wearing it. Korea makes great beauty products and this one certainly shines. I highly recommend it.

We heard about this from a you tube channel "hot and flashy". My sis and I like that it is not greasy and that it doesn't make our skin feel dry. There is no tint in this one and is not waterproof. For daily use it seems to be working well for us. We'd like this company to make another with some tint so that we can wear without makeup.

I have just began to use a separate sunscreen and wanted a mineral one that would absorb into the skin without being heavy or white. This sunscreen does just that. It does have a white cast but absorbs quickly and the white cast disappears. I absolutely loved the Whamisa Floral toner that came with this toner. I am interested in Korean skincare and this toner /essence is amazing. I would call it an essence because it‚Äôs thicker than a toner. It made my skin feel moisturized and refreshed and smelled wonderful. Definitely will repurchase the sunscreen and this toner in the future.

Very lightweight, has good coverage, and is excellent for applying makeup after. It doesn't leave a white coat on the skin that is too obvious, nothing that makeup does not cover. Great product

This sun block has a light fresh scent. I can‚Äôt feel it on my skin. It‚Äôs not like American sunscreen, thick, uncomfortable and bad smelling. We haven‚Äôt had a new sunblock formula in the states since 1999. Korean sunblock is years ahead.  This is the best sunblock I‚Äôve tired so far.

I watched a Youtube video comparing 20+ different sun creams and this one came out to be the best! I gave it a try and truly, it does not disappoint me! I could wear this alone or under makeup. It looked natural both ways. It does not look like a heavy while film or show large pores on the skin. This will be my go-to sun screen before wearing make up.

Angie from Hot & Flashy recommended this and I love it. It does it's job, doesn't make your skin white, doesn't sting on application, and doesn't contain chemicals that are bad for our skin and bodies. I have very fair, sensitive and older skin and I recommend this product.

I NEVER leave the house without sunscreen. My aging skin tans easily but I am attempting to fight the aging process by protecting my skin against UV Rays. This mineral based sunblock is perfect for my active lifestyle. I run 5 days a week. Sweating frequently causes sunscreen to run down my face getting into my eyes causing irritation. This one does NOT. It wears well under make up (no flaking by the end of the day) and goes on smoothly and easily. I am on my second bottle and I couldn't be happier. My husband (who dislikes sticky, tacky lotions) willing uses this also.

This sunscreen is very blendable doesnt leave any white cast and plus its broad spectrum which protects you from UVA and UVB!!

Love this sun block .... so light I barely feel it on my skin, not like most other mineral sunscreens. It is not really moisturizing but that is ok with me since I have my skincare for that.
