I bought this for my baby for a recent trip to Disneyland. I did a lot of research and felt this one was one of the best (ie. safe and effective) options out there for little ones. Hubby and I ended up using it for ourselves as well because it’s such a great sunscreen. I love that it’s a physical sunscreen without chemical components. There’s a little bit of that whitish cast but it’s actually not too bad compared to a lot of the others I’ve used. It’s also not too thick or greasy, and I love the smell! I’ve already purchased more including the smaller travel sized ones.

We love thinkbaby sunscreen! I’m a mama for 4 — 5 & under we have used this on all our kids. The ingredients are so clean that I feel comfortable using it on them before the 6 mo mark. It goes on creamy and smooth… spreads a lot better than other low/ non toxic sunscreens.

Turning white isn’t terrible… I suppose. But it’s really really white. I had finger prints all over my black purse and my black hat. My friend was wearing a black top and her kid hugged her and she had a huge white mark on her stomach from his face. I will say, the white goes away after some time. Also. I think it does a great job at doing what it’s supposed to do. We were on a roof top pool in 110° weather from 2-5pm and reapplied once in the middle and no one got burnt and we barely tanned. It’s pretty thick so it takes so muscle to spread all over a kid. Idk. I probably won’t buy it again.

Wanted to love this product as I read the reviews, have VERY sensitive skin, and am pregnant. Wore this 2 different days, was in the Michigan sun about an hour each day and got burnt both times. May work for some people, but sadly did not work for me - did the opposite of protect me from the sun.

I feel good about this option and it doesn’t leave my children totally white like other mineral sunscreens.

This is the perfect sunscreen for babies with sensitive skin. It is a little on the thick side.. life hack for easy application, us an oval foundation brush. It goes on smooth and even. 10/10 recommend

My family members who wore this sunscreen got burnt! We tried this product out twice and on both occasions lathered up and reapplied as directed, but still got burnt! Would not recommend.

My son and I have been using this sunscreen for the last few weeks and it has really dried out our skin terribly! We just kissed the return window, but I will not be buying this again.

Used this for the first time this weekend on myself before trying it on the baby. I put it on three times in a matter of 6 hours. Everywhere I put the sunscreen I tried to a burnt crisp. EVERYWHERE I missed I wasn’t burnt. Never using again.
