I read that these were some of the highest rating sun screens you could buy, however I can't rate them as I received 2 out of 3 apparently damaged or unable to spray.

I love(d) this stuff. I’ve been using this product for a couple/few years and didn’t think twice before ordering from Amazon again. This should be a 5 star review, however, I bought 2 cans and after much effort and many, many attempts, BOTH cans won’t spray as they should. I decided to check out the reviews and low and behold, I’m not alone. The packaging definitely has a “new” look since I last purchased but turned out to be a major downgrade. One can’t simply mist it over their own body. It takes me about 5 minutes to get enough sprayed in my palm to then rub on ONE forearm. HORRIBLE! Such a great product but completely useless since you can’t get it out of the dang can. Boooo! -Highly disappointed

I love this sunscreen but unfortunately wasn't able to get any out of the two cans I ordered. The spray tops were broken upon arrival due to poor packaging.

Spray nozzle doesn’t work. Non-refundable, so this was a total waste of money. Would not buy again.

I would get a sun burn before fighting another day with this can. What's inside does a great job for sun protection, It was so difficult to use and made a mess trying to get the sun screen out.

Alba's Hawaiian sunscreen spf 50 ruined two of my shirts by staining them orange. After 40 min with customer service the manager John V. offered me an Amazon gift card for $50, less than half the value of the shirts. So now I have to take them to small claims. I swear this is the truth. Avoid!

Oh my god! Stay away! They are defective and Amazon conveniently has listed them as non returnable!! Of course, I made a mistake of not reading the “find prints” so I have to throw out both bottles now. Disgraceful!

Works well for my 1 year old…… when I can get it to spray. I can’t get it to come out with one hand which frustrates me to no end. I’d love it if the nozzle worked. The one time I got it to come out, it was great protection wise!

We had to press incredibly hard on the spray button to get it to work - seems to have been defective

It gets clogged then won't spray anymore. This is a new design. Last year it didn't get clogged and worked fine. Now it's a waste of money because you can't use it.
