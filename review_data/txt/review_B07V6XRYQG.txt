I have very sensitive, pale skin. This was perfect for poolside use. I could apply and reapply quickly and easily. I didn’t have to worry about have a white face. It actually felt nice on. I know the applicator makes this more expensive than lotion in a bottle, but I feel more confident apply around my eyes (where my sister has had cancer spots removed). It also didn’t run into my eyes, while I swam. And no sunburn on cheeks or nose (even though I kept my sunglasses on).

Exactly what I was hoping for, based on their other products! Smells lovely, faintly of shea butter, and seems wonderfully moisturizing! Does it leave a slightly white cast? Yes. It’s a mineral based sunscreen. What do you expect? Mineral sunscreens work by being a physical barrier. Is it small? Yes. I am an adult who can read and see that the tube/listing says .67oz. I got this because I am healing from a surgery and my doctor recommended getting a mineral sunscreen so that my scars don’t darken in the sun, and mineral sunscreens work better for that, since they are a physical barrier. I already had Supergoop’s Unseen Suncreen and love it, and I’m so glad I got this! The moisturizing factor is also great for my scars.

Along with the Super Glow stick I love this zinc mineral stick. Again, I don't have to touch my face as I reapply through my day. Unlike other zinc sticks this does not leave a white residue and does not feel thick on my face. I have melasma so zinc and mineral sunscreen is a must for me.

I absolutely love sunscreen! I’m out in the sun a lot and this is great for sensitive skin. Only thing I will say you Need to rub it in.

Easy to put on and smells nice.

Very efficient Sun block I wish they make bigger oz

Easy to spread. Has white cast. Takes a while to go away. VERY small and expensive.

I bought this for my roadtrip with two hikes since the stick form is nice when you can't use hands. Due to my skincare regiment, my skin is particularly photosensitive. Although I don't mind the white buildup from the sunscreen, I don't like how messy it was. It literally melts upon application and becomes a mess. I ended up getting a few small dry/flaky patches that I feel were from inconsistent application (probably my fault). This is better than other competitor sunscreen sticks where people ended up looking like a lobster afterwards, I guess. The good part is that it didn't break me out. I always use a cleansing oil at the end of the day to wash it all off though.

This is a nice stick sunscreen but not as moisturizing as I expected and has a bit of a fishy smell.

My absolute FAVORITE sunscreen. However, this one came with good portion of the stick melted to the top and unable to be used, and for the price, thats unacceptable. It was out if stock though, so I couldnt exchange

I was super excited to try this sunscreen out solely based on the claim that it wouldn't leave a white cast which would make reapplication outside of the home super convenient and as germ-free as one could be. To my disappointment, the claims of being white cast free is a myth. As you can see from on of my photos, I'm pretty pale and this stuff still leaves a cast. I also included a photo for folks who want a better idea on the size of the product.

Works well but is pricy!

Way smaller than I thought .

I bought this for my cousin who is a landscaper because of the reviews. Since this is a stick form I thought it would be nice when you can't use hands. Due to my his sensitive skin, it actually burned his skin. It leaves a white film on your face and neck. It hard to wash off, very oily.

Sporty

This product is much smaller then you would expect. Its about 1/3 of the size of a deodorant stick. Considering the price, it should be a lot larger. It also goes on very thick and is hard to rub in. The other supergoop suncreens are amazing and I buy them all the time, but this product is terrible.

This is a very small travel size stick. A common drug store brand has a stick more than twice the size (1.5 oz) for about a third of the price ($8-$9). Didn’t notice the tiny size when I ordered. Not even going to open the package. What a rip off.

I received an used product with body hair on it, it’s really disgusting!

Pros: goes on easily and does not appear white; great, portable packaging. Cons: Sickly, sweet smell like sugar - it's all I could smell all day; So sticky that it's uncomfortable. Will not buy again.

This product continually leaves a white residue on my face

This sunscreen leaves a terrible white film. I was excited to try it but it was a huge let down.
