I wanted to like this, I really did...but, I didn't. I read about Drunk Elephant and thought this would be a great sunblock for me. I was even looking at their other products and considering which I might be interested in, though they are quite a bit pricier than the sunscreen. The packaging was lovely and I was excited to try it. It is unscented - which is something I look for in products I intend to use on my face. But, all products -though no fragrance is added- have a smell. This one was unpleasant. I have used many zinc-based products, at there is a "zinc'y" sense to it, but also a rancid or stale quality. As I applied it to my face and decolletage, I was keenly aware of the odor, so much that I wondered if people hugging me would notice and find it unpleasant. My second issue was how it felt - heavy, very heavy. I only used a pea-sized amount, as directed, yet it felt almost as though I'd slathered on Crisco. Within a very short time, my face began to sweat. Ugh, it was unpleasant. I was just sitting, not being active, as I usually am when I use sunscreen and my face was sweating. So, that was the third strike, that sent this product back to the bench, for me. With all of it's amazing sounding ingredients, I am truly disappointed. I guess there really is no one product that works for everyone. My search for a good sunblock continues. Best of luck, if you try this product. I hope it works for you.

As someone with very pale, oily skin, I am very picky about my sunscreens - I've tried a lot! I did a lot of research on the highest coverage and this was recommended.  I want to give it 4.5 stars because I think this formula is really excellent. It's really hard to find 20% zinc oxide sunscreen, which many people who really care about protecting their skin consider to be the highest, safest protection. (Be sure to read ingredients on sunscreens, I'm shocked how little coverage some expensive brands actually have). And given that it's DE there are some lovely, high-quality, soothing, moisturizing ingredients too - which do seem to have added benefits for my skin. My skin just feels more supple, and glowey  The half a star off would be because it does leave a slight white cast. Not enough to make me not use it (I do already have very fair skin), but enough that next time I'd buy the tinted version (even though it's more expensive for the amount). Overall I'm willing to put up with the slight white for high quality and high protection.  (For those saying that it's too greasy, while it's not the most matte one I've tried, as someone with oily skin it does indeed feel a bit greasy when first going on, but give it time, it does sink it a lot, just takes a while).

I have been using the original Umbra formula for over a year and while I did enjoy it, like many others, I did find it could be a bit difficult to blend sometimes and took longer than I'd like to set. Thankfully, DE greatly improved upon that formula! This new formula is much easier to apply, sets quicker, and is beautifully moisturizing without being heavy.  The tint is an added bonus and adds a nice warmth to the skin. (Note: this is not a tinted moisturizer/foundation and will not provided coverage, just a light evening of your skin tone that prevents a white cast).  Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchased and will continue to use DE's Umbra sunscreens!

This product was recommended to me by a young lady in Hawaii. She worked with a snorkeling crew, so I figured she knew what she was talking about in regards to skin protection. I'm glad I took her recommendation because I LOVE this product! It has a distinct smell that I can't quite describe, but it's pleasant. Not quite sunscreeny. It applies smoothly and evenly, with just a hint of color. My skin feels pleasant all day and it provides wonderful sun protection. I wore it to Disneyworld recently and didn't need any additional sunscreen to protect my face over the 12 hour days. The price is a bit high for what I normally like to spend on face products; however, I only have to use a tiny amount each time so I anticipate it will last me forever.

I love this - I used a few others when I ran out of this brand - and that’s a mistake I won’t be making again. This gives me a dewy, lovely finish, sun protection, and a moisturizer all in one. I’m getting older, and that matte finish in some products just don’t look right on my skin anymore. I would recommend this 100%

eos-eos

I was very happy to have found it, and like it very much. It is completely weightless, feels great on my skin and on most days provides enough cover to eliminate the need for another tinted day cream or make up. The most important thing to me is that a product it is cruelty free, and I go to great length to make sure of that. I was actually about to buy a different product, one that they sell at the dermatologist. It claims to be cruelty free, but they have other products and machinery that is tested on animals. I was glad to have read several reviews and came across a recommendation for Drunk Elephant, which I had actually not heard of before. I will be trying out some of their other products as well.

I love this product, I’ve been using it for a year. The bad thing about it is that if you don’t like an oily look then I would not get it. I like it because it gives a nice glow. Also if you use too much of it, it’ll bunch up on your skin and you can see where you put it. Also if you’re super pale, I wouldn’t get it.

I got this on the recommendation of Youtuber Stephanie Nicole. The price on this is high, but my naïve self thought it would be worth it. No, not in the least. Maybe if you apply a thin layer once a day, then sure. MAYBE this would be good in that instance only. I try to reapply every two hours when I'm outside or at work. My work place has big glass windows and I talk to people a lot when I am there. So I need a sunscreen that reapplies nicely over older layers, doesn't make me look ghastly, too orange, or greasy.  Let me tell you the positives of this product: a tint to avoid a white cast and zinc oxide for broad spectrum UV protection. Hence my headline, it does the bare minimum. Gives you the protection you need and in a tint that won't make you look pasty white.  The cons are a plenty. On first application, I had this sunscreen and a Japanese (biore) sunscreen. Before I started layering my sunscreens, I just used this on its own. I apply any sunscreen liberally (especially with no sunscreen layering) since it's known that we don't apply enough. First thing I notice, GREASINESS GALORE. This makes you shine like your ready to cook breakfast on your face. I am not afraid of a dewy face, but straight up shine and oiliness I can't stand. This does feel heavy on the skin, but I feel that's a common thing with mineral uv filters. While I like tinted physical sunscreens, it can be a con if it doesn't match your skintone/undertones. For me, it makes just my face more orange/red when my neck is more yellow. It's not dramatically obvious, but if I could spot it then chances are others will too. Moving on, the most annoying thing about this formula is when you try to apply the right amount of sunscreen to your face. This pills annoyingly and can get on your hairline, making you look like you got flakes. This is on first application. Imagine my surprise when I tried reapplying. If I apply a light layer of this, blending it in is not a problem and neither is the pilling. Will give you a nice glow too, but we can't apply it this way unless you layer other sunscreens with it. Some days I felt my face feel drier as the day went on with this sunscreen but it still looked greasy. Other days it would look matte, yet my skin still felt dry. I think this was due to different weather and my environment. The last con I have with this is even though this doesn't have "fragrance" in the ingriedients, all these extracts/oils from plants can have a natural fragrance. Anyone with rosacea or sensitive skin could be more prone to an allergic reaction or irritation on the skin from this crap. I am not in the sensitve skin category, but we need to avoid fragrance as well. Just cause it's natural doesn't mean it's good for your skin. Example: poison ivy. There's no benefit for fragrance ("natural" or not) to be in skincare.  FINAL THOUGHTS: I wanted to like this product, and was hoping the $36 price tag would be worth it. I am wiser now, and I learned that just cause the price tag is higher doesn't mean squat. Maybe if the formula wasn't so bad or it was improved, I MIGHT purchase it to use as a light layer over my other sunscreens. In that scenario only, would it probably be nice. That price tag though..for 60 mL.. Hell just get an asian sunscreen for way less if you want fragranced sunscreen. They have better UVA filters and formulas! $36 dollars for sunscreen.. Skincare Industry, folks. I do not recommend this to anyone, if I was unclear lol.

This stuff is wonderful. I used it all summer, also on my neck and hands. Yeah, it takes a bit of time to find the best way to apply it. It was flaky for me as well at first, but I think that is because you need to have the face completely dry when you apply it (no serums still on the skin before applying). I was surprised that it actually turns matte after 15mins or so, and that the whiteness goes away as well, almost entirely. I prefer mixing it with my Josie Maran Argan SPF tinted cream (just a little bit), I find that the color I get is the best for my face. Also, you need way less than with other sunblocks, as the structure is very light and spreadable. I love that it has only zinc oxyde (the safest mineral filter). The smell is irrelevant (good thing). At the end of the day, my face looks like it was at the spa the whole day!

There's no "sunscreen" scent and doesn't make my face feel oily. This is my all time favorite sunscreen and will be buying again when I run out. This sunscreen is recommended by Cureology as a sunscreen that is good for sensitive or acne prone faces. TRUE!

eos-eos

Gives my skin a subtle glow & Blends flawlessly with my light-medium complexion.. A little (pea size) goes a long way ; I do add a drop of argon oil for xtra hydration with the high/low temps. First product I have purchased from this line and will definitely buy again!

eos-eos

Love this product. My skin type requires zinc oxide for protection especially in the facial area. However using zinc oxide made me look like a "ghost" . Drunk Elephant found the right combination in that it's easy to use and blends in quickly to avoid the "ghost" effect. I use it daily.

eos-eos

I searched forever for a zinc oxide sunscreen that doesn’t make me look like a mime. This one does the trick. It doesn’t sink in entirely because that would be impossible, but it is extremely sheer. It doesn’t burn my skin and it seems to last a long time. Just what I was looking for. Note that it is not waterproof.

eos-eos

Lightweight, easy to apply, and did I mention the light scent? I wear it daily when doing my job as a mail carrier - I love it!

eos-eos

My dermatologist recommended Drunk Elephant as a moisturizer and I have been pleasantly surprised. Other tinted moisturizers I found are drying. This one is not. It is very light coverage but you can put it on a little heavier to get a bit more color. A little goes a long way. I give it some time to sink in, if I put a foundation or blush over it.

eos-eos

Great moisture for a high-SPF product. Tube is enormous, especially by Drunk Elephant standards. And it's FSA eligible! Great choice for either/both of luxurious sun care for dry skin and a high-quality use-it-or-lose-it FSA burner.

I’ve been trying to find a new moisturizer and I am very happy with this product. I look forward to putting it on everyday & I especially appreciate their use of natural products! I love that they support the #barewithus movement to promote self-confidence! Thanks for providing a product that makes me feel radiant, while also keeping my skin happy and healthy!

eos-eos

I like it great for light medium skin

eos-eos

I loved the way it covered my skin. I am blotchy from sun damage and this made my skin look like I have makeup on without the feel of makeup and without it feeling like sunscreen. Great coverage and even my friends where complimenting my skin. Won’t find a better sunscreen!

eos-eos

I love this because if I don't feel like wearing makeup the slight tint evens out my complex still so I'm not ghostly haha Depending on your routine, I would recommend moisturizing, then putting this on, then waiting a bit for the skin to absorb it then put on your makeup. At least that's what I do, I use powder foundation and I don't like to put it on right after so it doesn't get clumpy.

eos-eos

It's not easy to find a physical sunscreen that can be worn under makeup without pilling. This stays on for hours without flaking or a whitish cast. It is a very moisturizing formula, but doesn't clog my pores. The price point initially seemed high, however such a small amount is needed I think the tube will last for quite awhile.

eos-eos

This sunblock provides a physical barrier against the sun's rays. Unlike many similar products, it absorbs quickly and you don't wind up with a pasty white face.

eos-eos

LOVE THIS! I have abnormally sensitized skin. Certain foods, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, etc. make my skin react badly and most facial products do as well.  I did not burn or have a reaction after using this product! Smooth but covers well. Only need a tiny bit to use for your whole face. Well worth the money!!!

eos-eos

The product goes on a little thick but once it’s rubbed in, it’s good. There’s a pleasant odor, my boyfriend hugged me after I applied it and said I smelled good. I used it all week in the desert sun of NV and AZ last week and didn’t burn - and I’m fair skinned and Irish, if that tells you anything :-) I was very pleased with it and definitely recommend it. I do reapply every couple of hours if I’m going to be in the sun a while and this was easy to carry in a beach bag or pocketbook. I am pleased with the product.

eos-eos

I love this product! I use it before making up after moisturizer on a daily basis. Sun protectant, but also just evens your skin tone and makes my foundation look 10x better

Goes on smooth, Is white but rubs in translucent. I have tan skin and it does leave a bit of a white color so I look pale at first but as it settles on the skin (15 minutes) it is invisible.

Sun protection proven by my everyday tennis play and moisturizing benefits are a plus.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is wonderful for my coloring and is so moisturizing that it lasts all day. I am very fair skinned so the white-cream that comes out of the tube disappears on my face once it warms and thins. My daily routine is to start with a light moisturizer, wait 5+ minutes, and then apply a pore minimizer to my nose, wait 5+ minutes, and apply the Umbra Sheer sunscreen, thinly, all over my face. After it warms up I continue to blend it around my face to eliminate any of the white-ish tinge. It disappears completely on me, but I can see some tiny glitter reflecting light in places. I then set it with a fine dusting of loose powder.

Great undetectable application!!

This sunscreen has surely been a good investment. After receiving it, I immediately began using it and have been very pleased with it. There is no comparison to the popular store brands I would normally buy and use. It doesn't have a heavy nor thick consistency and the bonus is it doesn't leave you with a white residue. When I apply it, its quickly absorbed, feels light to the touch and moisturizing. I highly recommend it as a satisfied customer!

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen. It has become part of my morning facial routine, I wear it everyday as a protective layer on my face. After cleaning and moisturizing my skin it goes on silky smooth. I love the texture and it seals in my moisturizer in all day, you don’t need to wear foundation. It is a great price and lasts a long time and I would highly recommend.

I purchased this product after reading rave reviews on Beautypedia. I use this sunscreen after cleansing, applying vitamin C/E serums, and moisturizing. It is a thick sunscreen because of its composition, but it goes on fairly smoothly. In my experience, it does not leave a white residue or pill (as some users have commented). I also did not find that it had an offensive odor at all. In fact, it has no added fragrance, which is partly why I purchased it. If there is any odor to it at all it is very, very slight and natural smelling. Additionally, I have often found that sunscreens irritate my eyes, but did not find that to be the case with this sunscreen.
