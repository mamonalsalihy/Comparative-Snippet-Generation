This is my second order the sunscreen. It has a mild scent and even on dark skin sinks in perfectly for applying makeup if you want to. One of the high end department store brands was my go to for years, but since using this one, my eyes are no longer red, my skin no longer shines , burns or looks fried, even after working out or after extended periods in the sun. I'm open to playing with more products from Neutrogena.

First of all, the name of this sunscreen mentions that it is oxybenzone free which it is not, mine clearly has oxybenzone in the ingredients on the back. Second, it has a white cast on the face which I can't really stand. Third, it crumbles and "pills" on the face, and my friends always notice and tell me hey, you've got white stuff all over your face. Lol. Smh. So I don't think I will use this anymore. I'd recommend the Neutrogena hydro boost sunscreen which applies much better in many ways, although I hate the scent of that one...

This is my all time favorite sunscreen for my face. It is part of my daily morning routine now and it's just so nice on my face. I often don't wear foundation with it because it gives such a nice dewy look. I save it for my face and use other, cheaper sunscreen on my body. As someone who is very fair skinned, daily sunscreen has become a requirement for me and this is the perfect, light sunscreen that fits the bill. I haven't burned yet! I do reapply if I'm going to do more intense outdoor activities like biking, kayaking, etc. where I will be in direct sunlight.

I have fair skin (Scottish extraction) and my dermatologist requires me to wear sunblock to prevent any further damage that might lead to skin cancer.  I’ve used other high UV products in the past, but this one seems to be the best from the standpoint of ease of application, sheerness and scent. It’s basically “unscented” - there’s a faint scent that is pleasant, pretty neutral and fades fast. It absorbs quickly. I can’t speak to efficacy - I’d need to do controlled testing and I can’t be bothered! I like the Neutrogena products I’ve used, and this one is no exception.

As an African American, it's hard finding a high SPF sunscreen that doesn't make my dark skin look grey. This sunscreen is great because it doesn't make my face look grey and blends right in! It's also a very lightweight formula - after rubbing it in all the way, you can't really tell you're wearing anything which is GREAT for my oily skin. I also have very sensitive skin, but I have not had any negative reactions with this product and I've been wearing it every day since I purchased it.  Very happy I found this product.

Love this sunscreen, BUT two tubes received March 15, 2021 and both expire July 7, 2021!!! Really? If I would have known expiration date I would not have ordered!

I have to apply year round daily bc of a medication. I don’t want to smell like I’ve been at the pool all day so I got this. It’s great. No scent a couple mins after applying. You don’t notice it in your skin after either. It feels like a moisturizer not a sunscreen. It’s pricey so I’ve started choosing when to use it and when to use the cheaper stuff depending on my daily situation. Will rebuy.

Provides great protection and doesn’t burn eyes like many sunscreens. Goes on easy and not greasy.

I recently started using retinol, and wanted protection while hiking. I was worried about the white residue from some sunscreens. This has none, and goes on smooth. I put on under a tinted moisturizer and it worked great. Outside hiking for 4-6 hours without a sunburn.

eos-eos

I'm on a medication that creates photosensitivity, and have to wear sunscreen every time I leave the house. This sunscreen doesn't feel completely non-greasy, but I have yet to find a sunscreen actually live up to that claim. It leaves a white residue on whatever I touch, which is also to be expected from sunscreen, but it's still annoying for something I have to wear daily.

eos-eos

I do not like wearing sun screen but when it is necessary, this product is definitely the one I chose. It is not greasy or oily like so many other brands. It's not inexpensive but it is worth every penny.

eos-eos

My family has been using this for several years. Each of us loves the sheerness, the dry touch feel, and the excellent sun protection. A wonderful product!

eos-eos

Have used the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch lotion before. It is excellent. SPF 55 - UVA/UVB. I have dermatological issues and this lotion is exactly what I needed. Sunscreen has a shelf life of 3 years, but it is difficult to find the expiration date on most. It's there somewhere. Smooth, not greasy, broad spectrum, "lightweight and clean feel". Highly recommended. I noticed that Amazon offered several different SPF numbers available, probably more than you would find at a store.

eos-eos

Consistent quality and performance. I use a range of Neutrogena products depending on activity and all perform well. Also easy on my skin. The problem with store brands is that you don’t know from year to year who manufactures their product. I have been “burned” by varying year to year performance of the same store brand.

Using this straight since masked means no makeup (haha). Did detect a very mild fruity?? scent so this will be a NOT ON ME for grandson that think everything perfumy STINKS and he has a dog nose like Nana.  It’s OK, good price but I will be looking for something with ZERO scent

eos-eos

I have been using this sunscreen for years now, it’s very light weight it doesn’t make my skin oily. It drys pretty quickly and doesn’t have that over powering sunscreen smell.

eos-eos

Love this Sunscreen! I am a ginger with fair and sensitive skin. This stuff does not make me feel greasy and cause breakouts like others do! Also it truly works and stays on well! The scent is pretty neutral… smells like makeup honestly

eos-eos

Absolutely non-greasy formula. Feel free to apply on the first tee and not worry about slick, greasy hands. This product will stay in my golf bag forever-or until I need to re-stock :-)

Thus sunscreen is awesome. Not greasy, not heavy and no overwhelming smell. I use this on my face and neck daily. Doesn’t break my sensitive skin out at all. Works better than some high end sunscreens for me.

eos-eos

This is my favorite sunscreen- the only one I can stand on my face. It dries quickly and doesn’t leave any residue. It’s perfect for my sensitive and acne prone skin.

My skintone is dark brown. It is very hard finding sunscreen that doesn't leave a white or gray cast on my face. This sunscreen melts right in, very sheer, no cast and is so moisturizing. I love it and will purchase again.

eos-eos

Over the years, I have used a dozen or more sunscreens. Most provide an adequate level of protection, but many caused skin reactions of some kind. So, this is the first sun screen that has been free of reactions. I like it.

eos-eos

I've been using this brand/type of sunscreen for years, and love it! Very effective, with a great smell, and long-lasting.

This is a great face protection from the sun and sunspots. Feels good on your face which makes me use it more often.

eos-eos

This product blends with moisturizer and base while protecting tender, old skin. Very convenient dispensing.

eos-eos

This product goes on easy and provides great protection as well well as moisturizing the skin. Highly recommended by a person who has to be very careful about protection from the sun.

eos-eos

Slightly leaves a burning sensation on my face when applied immediately after washing face. However, I have sensitive skin and discoid lupus but I can still wear this product over any breakouts from lupus. It is not too greasy and has not caused acne or other problems. I would recommend it. The only thing I would recommend is offering it with a tint of color which would be cool.

After researching a few products, I chose this sunscreen for it's full UVA/UVB coverage, it's reportedly dry finish, and it's relatively affordable price. I have dry/reactive skin; I've been using this sunscreen for a little over a month now and am pleased with the results so far. The product goes on somewhat greasy, but soaks in within 10 minutes and feels very light and dry. This goes on without any burning or irritation and has no detectable fragrance. I use this as the final step in my morning routine and am happy to report no irritation or break outs. I'm rating it a 5 as it is exactly what I expected. Please note it does contain parabens.

Worked for me this last weekend at the beach. It’s lightweight, smells good, absorbs quickly and leaves a dry feeling, not greasy. I even used it on my 9 month old. I used only from my knees up, and my shins and feet got burned. You can clearly see where the sunscreen was applied.

Saw this in a YT video and the woman said it was very light and sheer, and it's true. I'm 45 and never use sunscreen, I guess mainly because of the stickiness factor, but I wanted to start. I apply it and it dissipates immediately and no smell.

eos-eos

Been using this for years. Very happy with Neutrogena brand. I have *lots* of precancerous growths from too many decades on the water with either the wrong sunscreen or none at all. Thanks to my dermatologist and this sunscreen I've been doing pretty good for the last few years.

Es mi protector solar de uso diario, facil de usar, peso ligero, y difumina rapido, no tengo quejas de este producto, lo he comprado en barias ocasiones, lo he usado en dias de playa en el Caribe y en el desierto y su proteccion ha sido excelente, obviamente reaplicandolo constantemente. Lo recomiendo

Works like moisturizer and protect skin from sunlight at the same time, I already introduced it to friend.

The sunscreen is moisturizing. It does have a perfume smell and feel good on my skin.

Does the job. Works well when you sweat in the sun. Doesn't melt off like other brands.

eos-eos

Highly recommend. Good quality. I like the way it smells and performs.

This lotion works great use it on vacations at the pool, lake or ocean cruises. I buy it as gifts and keep it on hand. Keeps me protected. I use it year round. Would love to see the seal of approval of not using on animals would be great to know this product and others aren't tested on animals.

To go sunscreen for me and my wife. Does the job perfectly and prevent us from sunburn all the time. They can do better with the scent though.

eos-eos

Bought SPF 50. Does not leave a white film, smell is neutral (great because Banana Boat's scent made me feel sick), lightweight, and works. Do need to reapply every 2 hours as I neglected to do this and got a little burnt. Very pleased, boyfriend loves it as well. We are both now loyal customers.

This is seriously the best face sunscreen EVER! I apply it everyday over makeup and it doesn't smear or smudge anything and it always goes on transparent and literally gets rid of the oil which is amazing! I have tried much more expensive sunscreens and have not had such great protection as this product. I can wear it in the sun for hours without getting burned. It never makes me break-out either! Go buy this product!

I must admit that - as an African American - I was very intimidated when searching for a sunscreen. I'd never worn sunscreen before and had never given it any thought. The only reason I began researching sunscreens is because I began using an AHA product that causes photosensitivity, which made the use of sunscreen essential. I've previously been ignorant to the fact that though the melanin in my skin provides some protection from the sun, it's not nearly enough to negate the need for sunscreen. Thankfully, I've come to my senses.  As I was researching, I'd read a lot about many sunscreens appearing white on the surface of the skin. Sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium oxide are said to be the most visible on African American/ethnic skin tones, so I avoided those. Unfortunately, however, those seemed to be among the most highly recommended sunscreens. After days of research, I was relieved when I came across Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch because it did not contain the aforementioned ingredients, seemed to contain the protection I needed, and was reasonably-priced.  This sunscreen works just as I'd hoped. Firstly, I've noticed no adverse effects from being out in the sun while using my AHA product, which seems to indicate that this sunscreen is doing its job. Secondly, I found "Dry-Touch" to be a very apt phrase to use to describe this sunscreen, as it certainly cannot be felt on the surface of the skin. Once it goes on, it's gone. This goes for its appearance on the surface of the skin, as well. It blends into the skin very easily (very little rubbing required) and cannot be seen. Given that I have light-medium brown skin, it would be immediately apparent if this was a product that did not blend into the skin properly. This sunscreen genuinely looks and feels as if I've put nothing on besides my normal skin care products, which was very important to me. The smell is also mild (it actually smells pretty good to me) and seems to dissipate after application.  Besides being worried about how the sunscreen would look and feel on my skin, I was also concerned about whether this product would cause breakouts. I'm in my mid 20s and still prone to pimples here and there. I'm very careful about what I use on my skin and - besides my AHA - only use natural products that contain ingredients that I know are beneficial to my skin and won't cause breakouts. Obviously, with sunscreen, I couldn't have that same control and had to just get over the fact that it would contain a ton of chemicals that are unfamiliar to me. Despite my apprehension, I haven't experienced a single breakout - or any irritation - since starting this product.  Though I have nothing to compare this sunscreen to, I can say that I feel very fortunate to have found such a great sunscreen on my first try and will definitely be back for more when my first tube runs out.

Gives a thin, silky, nongreasy feel. My dermatologist recommended using a sunscreen with SPF 55--and noted that SPFs above that don't work all that well. This product has an SPF of 50, and it works great for me. I reapply every two hours. Don't forget the tops of your hands!

Low scent and low white cast. Easy to apply and spread

I love this stuff! It rubs in super easily and isn't at all greasy. We've repurchased it several times.

Great product by Neutragena not greasy protective and no smell. Love this

This is by far the best sunscreen i've tried. I'm very fair skinned and i get red really quickly in the sun. With Neutrogena i don't feel the need to reapply as often as with others and there is no oily mess. It's not specifically for faces, but i use this on my face without breaking out the way other sunscreens make me do. It's also usually about 3 bucks more at a drugstore than it is here on amazon. Definitely recommend this for anyone needing to change their brand of sunscreen.

Non greasy and no white cast.

When they say 'dry touch' it's true. No greasy look to this lotion...it does dries matte. I love it.
