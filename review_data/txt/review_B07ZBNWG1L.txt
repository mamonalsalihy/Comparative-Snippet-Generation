Love this product for me and my little girl. It has a pleasant sent and keeps our scalps from burning. It’s nice to have a product to specifically treat this area as opposed to putting greasy sunscreen in our hair!

I feel like the part in my hair gets burned over and over again every summer, and I’ve tried every product. This is the best I’ve tried. The scent is a little strong, but fades fast. It’s not sticky or greasy. Love it.

$26 for 2 oz almost the price for silver! I liked the product but far too expensive.

I wanted a product that had sunscreen to protect my salon hair color while out for long walks in the sun. I sometimes wear a hat, but wanted the option of not wearing one. The spray is easy to use and smells great. If it keeps my hair from getting brassy from sun exposure, it's worth the high price.

I grab this to protect my hair and scalp during vacation. I have fusion extensions and I’m very careful about what I put in my hair but I also was going to a tropical location where the sun is strong and wanted to protect my natural hair and those extensions. This was perfect. My scalp didn’t burn and it protected my hair very well. I did not have any residue at all and it did not make my hair greasy. It was 100% worth the money this is an excellent product! Well by again in the future.

I've been trying to find a lightweight scalp sunscreen for a while now and I think this might be it. While not thin, my hair is very fine so as soon as it's wet my scalp gets pretty exposed. This always has me wearing a hat on the beach because I'm worrying about my scalp getting burned.  I've used this twice now with good results both times and didn't get burned. I did reapply it more than once each time but that's normal with sunscreen.

It’s a little hard to tell how well it’s working right now because it’s cold so I’m usually wearing a hat anyways, but I have been using it and it doesn’t irritate my scalp or seem to dry out my hair at all.  It might make my hair look slightly more oily but I have an overnight hair product I’m using which could also contribute to that. But honestly, it’s not the worst or impossible to deal with. I would much rather that than not protect my hair and scalp.  The scent was a little odd to me at first, but once I got used to it I don’t mind it at all.  It’s actually kind of refreshing to spray now. Would definitely purchase again, especially as we start getting warmer weather again.

I used this at the beach over the weekend, and did not have any sunburn on my scalp, which I typically would if I did not wear a hat. Definitely will buy again!

Bought for around ears, parts, and scalp edges. It’s hard to get regular sunscreen worked into these areas on kids and I didn’t want to risk burns. Worked great, we used it for about three consecutive days on the beach in the gulf coast where it’s easy to bake and no burns to speak of!

This scalp spray is amazing. It isn’t greasy and prevents a burnt scalp. This has been great for my softball playing daughter who is stands in the sun, with a part in her hair, all day. It doesn’t run down in her eyes, so she wears it with out a fight. This is a great product.

As a person with porcelain skin that a ghost would be jealous of, I am no stranger to sunburns. Having had several burns and wanting to protect my skin more, I found the Coola line of products to be worth the price. I don’t wear hats often and regular sunscreen on your hair is just too sticky so this has been a game changer! Worth the buy.

The clip on the nozzle is not secure. Can't pack to travel with it. Also the coating on the bottle is like wet spray paint...sticky and leaves your hands, fingers and anything it touches turquoise. You can not hold the bottle in any way to spray it without getting it all over your fingers or hands. Is this normal? HELP!

eos-eos

Works great and smells good. The only thing negative I have to say is that the packaging was melting off

eos-eos

I’ve been looking for sun protection for my head. This is perfect!

eos-eos

The bottle had already leaked when it arrived, so when I opened it and grabbed it, I got the turquoise coloring of the bottle all over my hands. I had to transfer the liquid to another spray bottle. When I finally used it, it made my hair really greasy and the smell was very off-putting. I love Coola products, but this one is a hard no for me.

eos-eos

Works great. Not super greasy when applied. This will be the new go to.

I have super dry hair so i need a little extra moisture, but this is a great product

eos-eos

It works well smells fantastic protect your hair from getting sunburn

eos-eos

Great product for bald or balding men its protects the sensitive scalp skin.

Scalp burn no more! This saved me on a Long Beach vacation. Thinning hair when wet exposes your scalp to the sun. This product solves the problem

eos-eos

Smells awesome...works great...

eos-eos

Great scent, not greasy or oily, one spray covers large area.

eos-eos

The bottle is very tiny but it does seem to work.

eos-eos

This is a wonderful scalp sunscreen! Love the light mist, the smell, and the protection.

eos-eos

Great product. The scent was a little many for me. I love Coola’s other scents though. I would love this in the white tea.

I loved this sunscreen so much because it did not cause any irritations or redness on my face.

I absolutely love this stuff. I recently went half shaved and wanted some protection during the summer since I spent a lot of time at the pool. This stuff works well. It smells interesting. Not in a bad way just very strong. It sprays on pretty well and easy to rub in. I haven’t had a burn on my head all summer. I don’t know that I would use if you’re concerned about your hair looking greasy. I don’t use this on my normal roots just on the shaved part of my head and I only use it when swimming or being outside in sun for long periods so I’m not too concerned with if looks greasy or not. But if that’s your main concern I don’t know of a hair/scalp sunscreen that wouldn’t.

I have very thin hair and I always wear a hat in the summer so my scalp doesn’t burn. I got this for my trip in the BVI. I couldn’t wear a hat while I was snorkeling so I searched for something that will keep my head from getting burned. I love the smell, it protected my head from getting burned. It did make my hair look a little oily when I reapplied durning the day. If you have ever had a sun burned scalp and the embarrassment of a peeling scalp you will love this product. I wish you got more product for the money.

eos-eos

It did make my hair look a little greasy, so that was disappointing, but it kept my scalp from getting burned.

I have oily type hair so it can be difficult to wear scalp sunscreen without my head looking like a greasy mess. Other methods do make my hair look oily and this spray does the exact same so I can't necessarily be mad about it. Otherwise, the SPF seems to help on days where I have my scalp exposed to the sun and at preventing sunburn to my scalp line. The spray isn't quite as dispersed and light as I would like it to be. I will be looking for other options after I have emptied this bottle.

Good for thinning hair and protects scalp from burning without making hair greasy

eos-eos

Some of the Coola products are hit or miss with fragrance or texture. This product works great, but leaves my hair feeling a bit too products. However, I like that it’s a pump spray for hair, but it also has a horrible smell. Like pepper meets cleaner? Otherwise, it works fine. I’m trying Calypso brand to compare, it’s lighter and no gross smell!

eos-eos

I love the fact my scalp is protected. But it leaves your hair oily and once it dries you hair is stiff

eos-eos

The bottle doesn’t squirt well and it leaves hair dry and crunchy. I don’t always want to wash hair after being in sun but you definitely have to with this stuff.

eos-eos

So far it’s working for my son who has the fairest skin and the thinnest blonde hair! Which is all I can ask for..my only reservation is the price for the size but when things work like this they can charge what they want.

I have always been a fan of COOLA's products. After many instances of being out in the sun, and coming back inside with a burned scalp, I realized I needed some type of sun protectant for my head, and was so happy to come across this spray. It was exactly what I was looking for, and doesn't leave your head feeling greasy. I recommend it to everyone I come across!

eos-eos

After spraying it on it made my hair greasy like I had put a jar of vaseline on it. Threw it away.

eos-eos

Like other reviews, it did make my hair a little greasy but at the same time, pool water and sweat does too. It really protected my scalp for the four nights I was in Cancun. No burn at all. I would recommend this product.

eos-eos

I bought this thinking it would be a great way to keep my scalp from burning, but instead it just made me look like I constantly needed a shower. I tried spraying onto dry hair and also onto damp hair. Both times I just looked gross. I was really disappointed with this purchase. You can’t reapply without looking even greasier throughout the day, so it doesn’t really protect you at all.

eos-eos

I really recommend this product. I had skin cancer a few years ago and this really helps me not to burn my scalp anymore when I'm outside.

eos-eos

This product helps with sun blockage but made my hair very dirty and greasy. And for the price it was not worth it. Too expensive!!! I will not pre-purchase.

eos-eos

Refreshing and does the job, and safe for the reefs which us a big plus! It leaked in the bag and took off all the exterior paint of the bottle so that was a bit annoying I think they need to redesign the spritzer.

I have fine hair but medium thickness it made my roots super greasy looking.

I bought this to protect my husband’s partially bald scalp. It absorbed well on the scalp, has a nice gentle smell, and protected his skin.

Saved my hair from Florida sun I like the herbal scent. Makes a nice shine too but don’t overspray or it gets a little oily

eos-eos

Look at ingredients! Cancer causing chemicals

I've used this all Summer and on my kids. None of our scalps got burnt nor did the hairline!

It was a birthday present for a friend with sensitive scalp. She was thrilled.

eos-eos

Highly recommend. Does leave hair a little greasy but my scalp did not burn.

This made my hair so greasy! I love Coola products but can't use this one because of how oily it makes my hair look and feel. Plus, it's super expensive for how much you get. Bummed.
