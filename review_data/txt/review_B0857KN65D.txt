I read that sunscreens are harmful to the reefs. This brand is reef friendly.. Iâ€™m so glad to have found it.

I looked so long for organic sunscreen and these ingredients sound great. However it is like my baby's diaper rash cream. WORST OF ALL I cannot squeeze it out of the tube!! My teenager gave up and handed it back to me tonite unused but 1x. I got 2 tubes Only 1 is opened. I missed the return date because I donot go in the sun much, so by the time I realized it wasn't useable, tonite, and that it is too hard to squeeze out, it was too late to return itðŸ¤ªðŸ˜³ðŸ˜­ Need a THICKNESS warning and i don't know how you'd get it to squeeze out of tube better.

Ok so I searched and searched for a sunscreen for my kids with good ingredients and came across this oneâ€¦was super excited to get it in a 2pk. And I used it on my kids one day at the pool before a beach vacation to test it out. And my 3children and myself allllll burned! So not cool to purchase a spf 50 and get a bad burn from it. I would not recommend for kids or sensitive skin, will have to toss this in the trash, such a bummer!

This sunscreen is so thick that is hard to extend it over the shoulders or face. It leaves in your skin a white thick coat that it is really unpleasant and looks weird and ugly on your face.

If youâ€™re looking for healthy Kabuki makeup this is the ticket. Too bad

We took this on a cruise with us. Itâ€™s very thick and pasty and did not protect well against sunburns. If I didnâ€™t reapply about every 20 minutes I would get cooked. It also clogs pores and made my skin break out.

Six days of sailing and no sunburn!

I applied one layer of a chemical sunscreen to my husband's chest (then the tub ran out), and used this mineral sunscreen all over his back and all over my legs... so I unwittingly did a comparison experiment. My husband got sun on his chest and stomach for two hours without damage, but spent 30 minutes sunning his back. In 30 minutes, he was sunburned. My legs also ended up sunburned, even though I applied a thick layer that had a white cast.  Do not buy this sunscreen unless you want skin cancer. It doesn't do anything.

Good sun protection. Lotion is very thick.
