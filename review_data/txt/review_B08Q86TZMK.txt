I love this sunscreen! I bought it because I saw black estheticians recommending it on Twitter so I thought that I should try it out. I am black and it leaves no white cast at all on my dark skin. I use 2 fingers worth of sunscreen for my face and neck and it literally doesn’t leave a white cast after rubbing it in. And it only takes a couple of seconds for me to completely rub it into my face. It does leaves a dewy finish, so if you have oily skin and would prefer a matte finish then this sunscreen may not be for you. I have oily skin and I love the dewy finish. Overall I would recommend this sunscreen to anyone especially dark skinned people because I know how hard it is to find an inexpensive sunscreen that won’t leave a white cast. This one is just perfect :) PROS: no white cast, fragrance free CONS: a little greasy

I bought this on a whim because I’m a sunscreen snob and I saw someone on Reddit mention that you can purchase this brand in America on Amazon now. About me: dry skin, 37 year old, light-medium skin tone, avid makeup enthusiast. If it’s greasy or doesn’t work with makeup I’m gonna wear it on my neck and chest and not my face. This stuff is AMAZING! It’s moisturizing, but not sticky or greasy, it sets down, but doesn’t dry out and has NO white cast. I’ve also had zero issues putting makeup over it. I’ve even tried it with the Kosas oil-based foundation and have no issues with pilling. I honestly can’t believe it’s only $10. Selfishly hope not too many people learn about this brand so the price doesn’t go up. Just kidding (well, sort of).

I have tried many sunscreens from Elta MD (good but very drying), Sheer Flesh (good but always out of stock and just so so sun protection), and a laundry list of drug store brands like Neutrogena, Sun Bum etc that cause eye irritation so bad that at the end of the work day I can barely see to drive home my eyes are so inflamed. And so many others that caused acne. This stuff is a god send so far, no acne, no irritated eyes, no white cast, no dry skin. I’ve only used it for two days but it only takes a few hours with a new sunscreen for me to know. I hope they never stop making this! Amazing stuff and the price is so reasonable, a third of what I’m used to paying!

US reviewer here -- this might replace my favorite Korean sunscreens. No white cast, easy to apply, very moisturizing. Should have guessed the Australians would figure out a great sunscreen!

I am shocked by how good this stuff is for the value. It has a milky texture (it's more fluid than thick and pasty, which I love). As it dries down, it doesn't turn your skin into the Sahara Desert, but to be fair, I have been very disciplined with serums to strengthen my skin barrier lately. I have very dry, sensitive, maturing skin, and I loved this upon first application (I immediately repurchased). A lot of sunscreens I've tried are too drying, too thick, too white, or too weak. This lotion absorbs quickly, doesn't leave a white cast or stickiness but it hydrates very well without causing sensitive reactions. As a former zookeeper, I love that it is reef-safe and the SPF is high, but I have not tested it in those environments or researched the science behind this product. The tube is a good size to stash in a workout pouch or a purse. I don't wear makeup anymore and cannot report how well it does at the beach, but as a city dweller with many skin issues, I love this so much! I'm a fan -- this is a winner!

I have combo-sensitive skin and was really looking forward to this based off of the reviews! It did not live up to my expectations. It says fragrance free but smells like the item was heated up, so the product smells like a plastic bottle. It's not super strong so I continued to use it to see if it was worth it. It goes on GREASY. My face has an oily sheen every time I use this product. Touch my face and my hand comes back shiny. It doesn't help pigmentation problems and if anything it's causing me to break out. Not worth it!!

The media could not be loaded. It is easy to rub in, thanks God for that!!! I just ordered 7 more for summer!

(04/13/2022) I've only used this for about 2 days and am already very, very impressed. I've been looking for an affordable sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't irritate my eyes, is reef-friendly, and layers well with the rest of my skincare. I hope this is the one, and I'm starting to let myself believe that it is!  So first, no white cast. I am a WW, so a white cast is not as noticeable on me as it would be on darker skin tones. That said, it also doesn't show a white cast on my partner who is Fijian Indian, either. It's moisturizing, so it does leave a beautiful dewy glow, which I personally love. It seems to layer well with my skincare (I do wait a few mins for the rest of my skincare to sink in before applying it) and reapplies throughout the day nicely.  My skin is combination-acne-prone. I haven't noticed an increase in breakouts due to using this product yet, but I'll be sure to update on that, too. Usually, if my skin hates a certain sunscreen, it'll react almost instantly. So far so good!  It also doesn't sting my eyes! This has been a serious issue for me, so I will continue to use this since that was one thing I've had a hard time solving with other products.  I haven't tested to see if it works well under makeup yet. Will update!

I love this sunscreen! It’s my new favorite! I’ve used it everyday since I got it a few weeks ago. I have really dry skin due to using Tretinoin so I layer this on top of my regular moisturizer. It gives my skin such a beautiful glow! It does look a bit shiny at first so I find I have to massage it in pretty well, but after that the glow is so pretty. If you have normal/oily skin, you probably do not need a moisturizer with this because the sunscreen is pretty moisturizing itself.  So far I haven’t noticed any breakouts from this. I also have pretty sensitive skin and it does not burn or sting like others I’ve tried. And I even put this around my eyes and I don’t notice any eye burning throughout the day! The only time it burned my eyes is when I accidentally got some right in my eye but after washing it out it was fine. I haven’t noticed any eye burning since then, even with the extreme heat/humidity and sweating!  I can’t really say much about the sun protection because I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible, but the few times I’ve been directly in the sun, I haven’t noticed any sunburns.  Overall LOVE this stuff! And for around $6 you can’t beat it!

eos-eos

I’m a black female with a medium tone and this doesn’t leave any white streaks or flashback. It also doesn’t have a strong smell or feel heavy. Will definitely be repurchasing!

I’ve been using this sunscreen almost every single day since the summer and it has become a staple in my routine. I personally find it to be a great sunscreen but it may be the best suitable for people with normal-dry skin. It’s super moisturizing and really gives you a dewy look. I have normal-oily skin and it can tend to look a little oily instead of dewy for me, but since I do wear makeup I tend to set it with powder and it wears nicely throughout the day. The scent is super neutral and nothing crazy, it does have that “sunscreen” smell so if you’re not fond of it I wouldn’t recommend. I am pale but I have never experienced any white cast nor have seen a white cast on people with darker complexions that use this product. It does not pill under makeup either if that’s a concern. One bottle usually lasts me about three months which I find to be pretty good since I do almost use it everyday and use a liberal amount. Overall I definitely recommend, it’s a super solid sunscreen.

It is my 1st tube and I love it. It is very moisturizing. I apply in the morning and reapply after noon. It leaves my skin shining and clear (not greasy or sticky). No scent what so ever, no white cast. It does not sting my eyes at all. One month of usage, it does not seem to clog pores. I don't wear make-up so I don't know how it does under foundation. Very happy so far. will purchase and it will be my sunscreen for this summer.

I needed a good daily facial sunscreen to go under my makeup that would fulfil the following needs:  1. Moisturize 2. Absorb quickly 3. Have high SPF  This sunscreen is so comfortable and ticks off all my boxes. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin; my skin always lets me know immediately if it's unhappy by greeting me with redness and breakouts. If anything, I feel that this sunscreen has contributed to the overall health of my skin. I'm on my second bottle of this, and my skin feels almost softer after prolonged use. The only con I've found is that it's almost too moisturizing because it has melted my lower lashes mascara so I switched to waterproof mascara.  It's extremely affordable, and I don't see myself using any other sunscreen from here on out.

eos-eos

Even though the face sunscreen and the body one are supposed to be basically the same, the face one absorbed a lot better and was not anywhere near as shiny as the body one is when used on the face. Otherwise, feels and works just like the body one, just better absorbing and way more matte.

eos-eos

the price is super affordable. this sunscreen blends in SEAMLESSLY. a couple of rubs and its gone. no white cast or pilling. i have dry, rosaecea, and acne prone skin. i put this all over my face and neck and haven't broken out, gotten dry, pilled, etc. goes well under makeup too.

I have acne prone/combo skin and finally found a chemical sunscreen that doesn’t break me out. I was hesitant about putting this on but decided to go for it. It actually isn’t bad at all. If you have oily skin it’ll make you turn into a moisturizing grease ball though. Other than that, I’m adding this into my collection and will be ordering the 5oz next time.

eos-eos

This product is great for the body ( I purchased both the face and body sunscreen) however I think the face sunscreen is too greasy. I put in on after applying my moisturizer and my face looks wet.  I’m not sure what ingredient is irritating my skin but I’m noticing some breakouts.  I decided to stop using it on my face because I can’t understand why it’s so oily. Overall it’s a great moisturizing body sunscreen.

eos-eos

I have really dry skin and this sunscreen lotions works really good so far. Does not leave a white film on my face. I have not broken out. It does give a dewey glow, some would say a shiny face but I just use my blotting sheets and then I apply my foundation. Works amazing. I have rosacea and this hasn't broke me out yet. Its affordable and I will be buying more

eos-eos

At last a sunscreen that my scent-sensitive husband can tolerate and my super sensitive skin can tolerate. And it’s SPF50! What’s not to love? I will add it is moisturizing which my body loves but not my face. So I will stick with my Paula’s Choice Mineral sunscreen for my face and wear a hat as it’s only SPF30.

eos-eos

I just received this sunscreen a few hours ago and had to try it out before I head out the door. I’m in complete shock. I can’t believe it was only $10 first of all. Application was so seamless. I got a nice dewy glow, and it’s soooo moisturizing. No white cast and no tears. I applied a little bit foundation 10 mins later and it looks flawless. Must buy! Definitely adding this to my holy grail skincare bunch.

eos-eos

I truly can’t hype this sunscreen enough! I have dry sensitive skin and have struggled to find one that works well for years now. I love that this is thicker and moisturizing but doesn’t melt my eyes out of my head. It’s fragrance, cruelty and oxybenzone free and so reasonably priced for the quality.

eos-eos

I saw this sunscreen on TikTok, and I have been looking for a sunscreen for my combination acne-prone skin, and I think I found it! it leaves my skin moisturized but doesn't make it oily. It has a strange scent to it, but it faded away after you have it on for a few minutes. Definitely recommend!

eos-eos

Really like this sunscreen and how it blends into darker skin with no white cast even when doing the recommended 2 fingers worth, it also has no fragrance so it doesn’t irritate my skin. The only complaint is that it does leave the skin really “greasy” after application, this can be solved using a little face powder but it’s kinda annoying if you don’t wear makeup regularly

eos-eos

This product is really moisturizing for my super sensitive skin. My skin did not react at all to it. Of course, that all depends on one’s facial skin. But I really enjoy this SPF. I have combination skin and I live in a tropical climate where this can be a little too greasy sometimes but if I just use my hydrating toner and skip the moisturizer, this works great. If you’re not into the dewy or greasy look, I wouldn’t recommend. I think people with dry skin types would love this.

eos-eos

Love it exactly as described feels like a moisturizer. Not oily at all just allow to dry some, or for fast drying just use a fan. Then apply makeup as normal. Love love it and affordable. My skin gets irritated rather quickly but this product ,feels awesome and no irritation. Will buy again and stick with it. A little goes a long way I bought it on April 10 and it’s now June 18 th and still have some to last maybe another couple of weeks really worth the buy.

Love love love this product. I’m a dark skinned woman and have no issues..I am also very sensitive and prone to breakouts and have had zero issues!!! This is a phenomenal product at an even more phenomenal price!!!

This sunscreen is great! No white cast. Very hydrating and perfect for my dry skin. There is no scent and it does not break me out. Doesn't pill when you reapply. Works great under makeup.

I've been on a hunt for a good facial sunscreen that is a great value (I am never going to pay $40 for a 1.7 Oz bottle of sunscreen!) that feels light, doesn't burn my eyes, and doesn't have any fragrance. THIS IS THE ONE, THE SEARCH IS OVER. It leaves a slightly "dewy" finish that some people may like, I personally don't and would say that it's the biggest flaw for me although it's really not that bad. It doesn't leave a greasy feel and there's no white cast.

eos-eos

This stuff is amazing! I went to the beach for 4 days and the only thing that was burnt was my body, I applied this to my face and my face stayed protected. 100% recommend this stuff! It’s cruelty free too :) it stayed on even after getting in and out of the water. It doesn’t feel oily.

eos-eos

I have very dry and somewhat sensitive skin, especially being on Tretinoin. I needed a hydrating, waterproof sunscreen I could use alone or under makeup. So far this is perfect. It is a tad oily after being applied, but all I do is rub it in a little more, let it sit a few minutes more then apply makeup if I'm going to wear it.. I've not had any breakouts from this product either.

I was looking for a sunscreen that didn’t make my skin look gray; this product is moisturizing; scent free and just want wanted.

I love this sunscreen ! Makes my skin looks so pretty . Has a very faint scent kinda like sunscreen scent.  It’s a little greasy at first till it soaks in and leaves a glowly finish touch  Once totally soaked in it looks so good! And it’s not sticky anymore. You will have glowly skin the whole time. There’s no scent after it sets in either so that’s a plus !

This SPF works great on the face as a moisturizer/SPF in one. I feel it's best suited for dry skin since it's so emollient. It can sting the eyes though...

I wanted to add sunscreen to my skincare routine but had issues before with the cast and looking white/purple after applying. This sunscreen feels lightweight and is very moisturizing- more importantly it dries clear and I don’t have to worry about any weird coloring after applying.

Good, dewy look best for dry skin, no white cast, very moisturizing!

Sunscreen is a part of my daily routine. I am a melanated beauty but having even skins is must. Fragrance free is truthful and my face is not super oily.

I thought sheer sunscreen was the bigfoot of the skin care industry. I was wrong. This comes out of the bottle white but the second you put it on your face it’s clear. I could apply the entire bottle and still would not have a white cast (it would be disgusting and sticky though). Best sunscreen I have ever bought.

Love to use this as my everyday sunscreen. Absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my face shiny. It kind of smells like a beach ball but the smell goes away after application. Will purchase again.

I am amazed that this product works so well and the price is great too! It wears well under makeup and is moisturizing but not heavy.This is my new favorite sunscreen!

I was in desperate need for a waterproof/sweat proof sunscreen for pool days, jogging, and softball. I wanted a chemical sunscreen that didn’t burn my eyes, which was easier said then done. I hate sunscreen that leaves white especially since I’m reapplying frequently and white cast seems to get worse with each subsequent application. My eyes are also super sensitive to so many water proof sunscreens so as the day goes on they become red, tear up, and eyelids swell making me miserable.  This sunscreen has checked all my boxes for a summer sunscreen. It’s also very moisturizing. It does make my skin look incredibly shiny when first applying, but that does go down shortly after applying. I’ve been to the pool for hours several times this summer and this has delivered wonderful protection. I also use the body sunscreen in conjunction with this. I really put it to the test with a few weekend softball tournaments in 90+ degree heat and the protection held up. I just wish they could keep it in stock consistently.

I have combination and sensitive skin. This was the first sunscreen I have found that doesnt burn my face neither does it cause pilling on my face! Love this!

Love this sunscreen! There is no white cast and it goes on the skin super smoothly. I don't break out nor do I feel oily. I also love how affordable the sunscreen is. A must buy!

eos-eos

This is definitely in my sunscreen rotation--theres absolutely no white cast and it dries down pretty non-greasy. I do have a little shine when it first goes on, but I just fix that with a little powder if I am in a rush or if not it goes away within a half hour.  Even my little brother who is sunscreen-averse because he hates the greasy sunscreen feeling, loves this.

eos-eos

I would definitely recommend this to friends as an affordable, no-nonsense sunscreen. It is fairly moisturizing, has no discernable fragrance, doesn't leak, doesn't break me out, and rubs in easily. Of course, the packaging is not as "cute" as that of other sunscreens, but if that's not a priority, this works great.

eos-eos

Great porsucr! Lightweight! Goes on smoothly, moisturizes without being heavy...Just a little goes a long way! Skincare guru Caroline Hirons recommended this and it's a winner!

Great coverage for California sun. Not greasy, absorbs well, no shine. Nice moisturizer.
