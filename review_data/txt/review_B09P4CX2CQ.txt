I love my Coppertone even if forget to put it on and get to much sun. I can put it and still turn brown. Make my skin soft too.

Love coppertone and often have a hard time getting the SPF8, so glad I can find it here!

Hubby loved coppertone, only brand green will use and hard to find in the stores in number 8!

Sun protection works well. Smells good and moisturizes - I will purchase again!

I love the looks of the suntan

Good sun protection and lovely scent

This product is so great.

I deliver alcohol for 10 hours a day. I spend a good portion of these hours in direct sunlight in Reno Nv. This stuff keeps my 58 year old bald head protected. I highly recommend this stuff

Light for summer activities. Smells great

Smells initially like the Coppertone we grew up with and love but it is short lived before the smell turns chemical. I was disappointed and returned both bottles.

If you've grown up with Coppertone, than you most likely know what to expect. A good quality, reasonably priced suntan lotion that is safe for most users. Applies easily and moisturizes the skin as it helps to provide you with protection from the rays of the sun. Being a level 8, this will only provide you with so much protection. An 8 has always been my favorite level because I want some of that sun on my somewhat fair skin. This is sort of a compromise level. You get enough of the rays to help give you a glowing tan, but not so much that you end up burning yourself to a crisp. Of course, even then you'll need to know your particular skin type and how much you are able to handle, as well as for how long.  There is a tropical scent, but not overpowering like some. Just enough to smell pleasant and beachy, but not so much to be annoyingly overpowering. Once this sets, you won't be feeling like a greased pig either as one often does with an oil. You'll be moisturizes, but not slick and sticky.  I like that this contains vitamin E which I've found to always be one of the secrets to maintaining good, overall skin health.

I remember this stuff from when I was a kid. This was THE brand. Still has that same smell that instantly takes me back to the beach. Yes, this is only SPF 8 and we all know you should be slathering yourself in SPF50 or more. Now that that responsible disclaimer is out of the way... this is what you use when you want to get a fast tan!! Easy to pour, easy to apply and it lasts for like an hour in the water (or in my case, sweating on the beach while I get a tan). Or maybe if you're just going for a walk - just rub it on exposed parts like arms & legs (don't forget your face). Coppertone is still THE brand and I'd gladly recommend it.

This is the ideal sunscreen for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to burn but also wants to be able to tan and get darker when laying out. Typically I would use a 15-30 if I know I‚Äôm going to be out in the heat not watching if I get burnt, but a lower SPF if im specifically laying out to tan. I know I can always trust coppertone because I‚Äôve been using this brand since I was a kid. The smell on this one is nice and like your typical sunscreen. It‚Äôs a squeeze bottle and liquid lotion that you have to spread with your hand. I typically prefer spray but I know that you have more control when using this and can kind of see where you might have missed better than the spray.  Great for staying safe while still getting your summer tan!

This Coppertone sunscreen tanning lotion is a lightweight formula enriched with Vitamin E that makes my skin moisturized without feeling too greasy. It smells great, it‚Äôs water resistant and more importantly, it provides the sun protection my sensitive skin needs!

eos-eos

I don‚Äôt remember a time when this was not around. In the summertime, there would be a bottle or two of suntan lotion or oil and one, two or all would be Coppertone.  For those who have used this product, you never forget that scent. The familiar scent is still there as is the picture of the little girl on the bottle with the dog.  This is an SPF 8. I like it when I don‚Äôt plan on being in the sun all day. It gives protection and is not overkill.  It still has that familiar smell that I grew up with. It‚Äôs non-greasy and comes in a generous 8 oz. Bottle two-pack. If that‚Äôs not enough, it is water resistant, too.

eos-eos

Has a nice light scent! Goes on very smooth and doesn‚Äôt leave skin feeling greasy. Doesn‚Äôt have a lot of spf so make sure to put sunscreen on first to prevent sunburn. It definitely helps you tan faster.

eos-eos

I've used Coppertone lotions and oils for years, they provide a consistent, high quality product and this is no exception. This lotion is not oily or greasy; it absorbs on your skin within a few minutes. The smell is slight; no overpowering fruits or coconut - just the standard Coppertone scent. The SPF 8 is perfect if you already have some base tan and want to deepen the color without burning.

eos-eos

I only use this on my legs but it works great. Just be sure to reapply quite often because it's really not much better than using nothing at all so you will burn quickly, not to mention skin cancer. I usually use an spf 15 on my legs but decided to give this a go. My legs were tanned up in 2 hours the first day.  Smells good. Doesn't stay tacky or sticky on the skin. Moisturizing.

I have always loved Coppertone sunscreen! I'm happy to report that this is exactly as I remember it. It smells so good, very reminiscent in bringing back memories of fun in the sunüåû. You get 2 good size bottles...it comes out easy and goes on smooth. Gives you some protection from the UV rays but allows you to achieve that healthy glow you want in no time. I absolutely recommend it!

I‚Äôm 52 and have never had a sunburn. During the summer months- at our pool or the beach- I don‚Äôt stay out too long, but while I‚Äôm there I want a little color. This is perfect for me- as I mainly want to moisturize and not prevent all sun. I always use a 50 on my face- but 8 or 12 on everything else. This Coppertone product has a great fragrance, and moisturizes so well.

eos-eos

Who doesn‚Äôt love Coppertone?? I love the scent of Coppertone sun lotions and this one is perfect. It is more lightly scented than the traditional sunscreen. This has a low SPF so it‚Äôs great for tanning with just enough (for me at least) SPF to keep me from getting sunburn. If you don‚Äôt burn easily but still want some sun protection this is a great product.

eos-eos

Well I‚Äôm not really a sunscreen user. I figured to go ahead and get this kind since I do like to get dark. It‚Äôs good to have I prob opt for only a one pack for me since I‚Äôm not out in the sun like I used to be when I was younger. Maybe it will change more as my youngest gets a little older. This is the brand I usually would pick up when I do buy it though.

eos-eos

As someone who is very fair, but loves to get a tan on during summer time this is perfect. This has just the right amount of the spf for me to get tan without the burn. If you do burn pretty easily I‚Äôd maybe recommend applying a higher spf sunscreen underneath it just to be safe. But definitely going to be using this ALOT this summer üôåüèª

They say tan skin is damaged skin, but there are so many things in life that people do regardless of potential health ramifications. With a nice tan, comes the risk of damaging your skin. So you might as well be as safe as you can when tanning. This lotion allows you to tan still but provides some needed moisture to your skin.

eos-eos

Smells like the beach! This is the real stuff, not a sticky oily feeling knockoff brand. And it smells so good! Went on smooth and creamy, absorbed nicely and it smells so good. 2 bottles at a great price and it smells so good! Great product and great value, definitely recommend!  Did I mention that it smells so good?!

eos-eos

I wasn't sure how well this would work. I always wanted to try it but didn't want to get burnt. The first day I used this I was surprised. I did reapply it often but I came home with a nice tan and I wasn't burnt. I do recommend reapplying it often. It goes on well and isn't runny. Yes, I'm buying this again!

eos-eos

Because I only see the sun a few months of the year, my first few times in a swimsuit I use an SPF a lot higher than this. But once I‚Äôve established a base tan, this is my go to. Feels great on, need to reapply fairly often depending on sun intensity however.

eos-eos

We have always trusted Coppertone for all of our SPF needs. I prefer to get a tan when I‚Äôm spending time in the sun, but know I still need sun protection. This tanning sunscreen is perfect for me. Smells good, absorbs well and the 2-pack is a great value.

eos-eos

I use this in the morning before my daily run and I‚Äôve already noticed an improvement in my tan. It goes on comfortably and evenly. I like that it doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling sticky and itchy.

eos-eos

Great product. Blends well, a bit on the thicker side but rubs smooth. Classic Coppertone beach scent, not obnoxious. Good value for a 2 pack. Leaves my skin moist and smooth.

Perfect for tanning and being as smart as possible while accomplishing a tan. Nice scent and not greasy which I LOVE! A great price for 2

This Coppertone Tanning Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 8, is water resistant and smells heavenly but it is a chemical barrier sunscreen.  This sunscreen is made for people who tan easily and don't burn because it is only SPF 8. This a lovely, creamy, lotion that goes on easily and dries without any greasy or tacky feeling. And the scent is positively divine!  My issue is that this is a chemical sunscreen rather than a physical barrier sunscreen. I prefer physical barrier sunscreens because they are safer for the environment and there is no concern about putting physical barrier sunscreens on children. It's a good idea to Google a little about the differences between chemical and physical barrier sunscreens so you can make an informed decision about which is best for you.  That said, we absolutely know that too much sun exposure leads to premature aging and even skin cancer so if it is a choice between no sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen, I would absolutely choose the chemical sunscreen.

Works good and I have no complaints getting darker without burns so I‚Äôm happy

eos-eos

Great for quick tanning sessions. If you plan on being outside less than an hour in the sun, this is a great way to get a dark tan without burning. I wouldn't recommend using at the beach/poolside unless you plan on reapplying and using higher SPF at some point. I put on while I do gardening, mowing, if I sit outside and read for a half hour, before going on outdoor runs. Anything outside where its not long term. Do not leave it outside with you, formula will become runny. I don't care what they say, it does have a slight greasy feeling to it, but all sunscreen tends to have a slickness to it.

eos-eos

Absorbs easily. Traditional Coppertone scent. Not a high SPF so it is great for light protection. Also moisturizes. I use higher SPF for prolonged exposure but this is perfect for when we go walking or sit on the deck for a bit.

eos-eos

This is a great product for those who are already tan, that just want a bit of protection from the sun while maintaining that glow! Smells great and blends into skin very well, no caste or greasiness to this.

eos-eos

This is the best lotion no doubt! Most lotions will keep you safe from burn but you can‚Äôt get a tan! This lotion lets you stay safe and look good!

eos-eos

I've used Coppertone for 40 years. The smell isn't too strong and it works well to prevent burning. I highly recommend it.

I love the smell of coppertone. It hasn‚Äôt changed in 50 years. It gives good uv protection, tho I reapply every 2 hours.
