Product cannot be returned, so this was a complete waste of money.

To be unscented, it has a smell of rubbing alcohol. It really irritated my sinuses.

I have fair (freckle don’t tan, burn easily then peel and back to white) and sensitive skin. So does my son. I live on the coast, in a southern state and vacation in the Caribbean often. After too many years of getting burned, I finally found Coola a couple years ago. It has revolutionized my time in the sun.  Here’s the thing tho. If you don’t apply it properly, it’s not gonna work. If you’re looking for something to put on AT the pool or beach, go for something else (with zinc oxide preferably). If you’re willing to take 5 mins before you go to do it, you’ll be very happy. Kids especially are hard enough to get covered before they see water anyway!  Here’s some tips: Spray everyone OUTSIDE (even the unscented can overwhelm inside, and you really don’t need to be breathing in ANY sunscreen)  DO NOT USE ON FACE. It will burn your eyes when you sweat/swim. Choose a cream or face stick.  Spray until skin is wet. You’re not looking for a light misting, you’re going for full coverage. The can can sound like it’s spraying, but if you don’t see the product on the skin, you’re gonna get burned.  Give it 5 mins to dry before putting on shirts/cover ups.  Reapply between 2 & 3 hours of water exposure. (We usually dry off, respray, then have a snack or lunch) Give it 15 - 20 mins to soak in before you hit the water again.  I’ve found a 6oz can will usually take care of two adults and a child for the day (initial and resprays). It’s a tad expensive, so we use Coola on days we plan to be out for more than a couple hours, or every day in the Caribbean, since the sun is SO intense.  The 2oz is ‘touch up’ sized. It may take care of a child’s initial spray, but I’ve found it more suited for adding additional spray to areas that feel a bit crispy, rather than using it on a single application.

Heard so many good things about this company, was excited to try it. Burned my eyes!! So disappointed.

It was a blasting spray I felt it should have misted ?

It worked like it was supposed to. I was out in the sun for hours with no sunburn. However, it caused a major skin irritation and itching everywhere I sprayed it and it didn't go away for a few days. So if you don't have sensitive skin this will probably be a great product for you.

Good product

I needed a travel size nice sunscreen and this fit the bill, it ended up being perfect for the bit of protection I needed while traveling through Italy for 2 weeks in the spring.

I am a kayaker and a gardener Sun protection is important for me. I used this product as directed, and went out into the sun for about 30-45 minutes. I burned on all the areas I applied. Amazon will not let me return, but I won't be buying this brand again. Don't waste your money.
