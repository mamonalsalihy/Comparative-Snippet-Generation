I'm a die hard user of sunscreen but as an African American woman most Physical sunscreens give a horrible white cast either alone or in combination with foundation/powder. I've tried 100% chemical sunscreen and find them too greasy or broke me out. My dermatologist recommended EltaMD and I will never use anything else.  I like that this sunscreen is SPF 50, that it has no white cast on my darker skin and that it is water-resistant. An added bonus is that there is no stinging if I rub my eyes after application. This is my HOLY GRAIL sunscreen. EltaMD please never discontinue this product or change the formula!  I use about a pea size amount which is all you need for your face and neck. I rub it on my face and neck in an upward fashion and within seconds it is absorbed. Initially there is a shine to my face, but that is gone within a minute or so. No white cast at all and it plays nice with my other face products. I don't have any problem layering this with my primer, foundation and/or pressed powder. I apply my sunscreen first, then my primer, them my foundation or powder.  I wear sunscreen daily, I never leave the house without it and after talking with others, I wear it when I'm in front of my laptop screen for long periods of time.  I hope this review helped you and thanks for reaading!

I had this product recommended to me by my dermatologist. It was about being non greasy and a very good daily sun screen. I use this EVERY day. I small amount goes a long way. I use about the size of a dime in the palm of my hand.  I have also ordered the tinted cream that this product is available in, as well. I sent it back because it was greasy and the tint looked retched on my face. Never put the sun screen around your eyes and certainly do not apply moisturizer or sun screen and expect your eye makeup to stay put. I wear a very gentle sunscreen around my eyes and only if I’m going to be on the water for some time.  Barrier cream. You can read a review that I wrote sometime ago regarding the barrier cream. I was not thrilled with the cream.  Then, I spoke to my plastic surgeon about the line after my face lift. What I found out is most of us are using the product incorrectly. The barrier cream was not designed to be used alone. Here’s what was recommended to me. 1. Clean your face ( I use the Elta cream cleanser twice a day.). Pat, do not rub your face dry. 2. Dispense just one pump of the Barrier cream. Place a small amount on your neck. I would describe a small amount to be about the size of half your small finger nail. Move the product gently all over you neck area and even back under your earlobes, Than place the same amount on each cheek and on your forehead. Gently rub the product in. You’ll notice that the product starts to liquify as you move it around your face. 2. Add a dab of the 50 sunscreen. Dab would be about the size of your index finger nail. Put the sunscreen in all the same places you applied the Barrier product. Your face will not absorb more than it needs. The rest stays on your face and simply looks and feels greasy. 3. Now apply, again using the same index finger nail amount, of the moisturized that you normally use daily, on top of the barrier cream and the sun screen. 4. Repeat this same procedure at night. Apply either your day time moisturizer again or use the same amount of night cream in the process. In the evening is when you will want to apply the eye repair and an evening eye cream.  The secret? Most of us have been applying way too much of these products. I have Irish skin. Too much of anything sends my skin into over drive! 5. Let it be absorbed. I like to dry my hair here. 6. Now, go about applying your make up. 7. The same rule regarding quantity of liquid/ powder/ cream base makeup applies. Use the size of your index finger nail of the base. What you’ll find, is that with the three products you applied earlier, your makeup will spread and blend very easily. You’ll need less of everything.  I’ve been using this process for several years. I was a Sun baby until I hit 40. Never used a sun screen. Now I’m 70. My face has paid the price of my foolish youth. Hang with these products. Limit your amounts, give your skin time to adapt. I will try to load a picture I took last week of my 70 yr old face. You judge for yourself. My handsome brother is in the picture with me. He is 72.

Have you looked at the price on this stuff? DO NOT BUY...you can get an effective zinc-based sunscreen for a third the price. No, less than that: the stuff I replaced it with was 1/3 the price for twice the amount. So...make that "for a sixth the price."  The product was recommended by my dermatologist, who wishes to see me cover my body from hairline to toenails with zinc sunscreen. And she's right: since I've started using products with zinc, the brown spots have begun to fade away, the actinic keratoses have stopped popping up left and right, and, amazingly, the facial complexion looks noticeably better. She sells it out of her office -- I came to Amazon hoping to get a better price, but nooo...they must have some sort of deal to fix the price across the board.  After I stumbled across a zinc sunscreen product, made by a well-known major toiletry manufacturer, in a local supermarket and discovered it works just as well for a fraction of the retail price, I felt like a sucker for having spent the money on this one.  Read the ingredients; write them down if you can't remember them. Then look around for the same stuff under a different brand name...and a different price. ;-)

I thought I was buying a mineral based product with zinc oxide, only. After I received it and read the ingredients, I found out that it also contains Octinoxate, 7.5% and Octisalate, 5%.Octinoxate, and many other things I can't pronouce. This is from Women's Health Magazine; One of the most common ingredients found in sunscreens with SPF, octinoxate is readily absorbed by our skin and helps other ingredients to be absorbed more readily. While allergic reactions from octinoxate aren't common, hormone disruption is: the chemical's effects on estrogen can be harmful for humans and wildlife, too, should they come into contact with the chemical once it gets into water. Though SPF products are designed to protect skin from sun-induced aging, octinoxate may actually be a culprit for premature aging, as it produces menacing free radicals that can damage skin and cells. I read and reread the Amazon webpage and the other ingredients are never mentioned. Only "mineral based" and "zinc oxide. Maybe this doesn't bother you, but it should. Over the last few decades, the numbers of people diagnosed with skin cancer has risen sharply. At the same time, so has the use of sunscreen. Hmmmmmm

The media could not be loaded. I finally found a sunscreen that doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I am of dark complexion so when I apply the required amount I have to rub rub it in but it does spread easily. I noticed no white cast once I rub it in adequately. I always have sunshine so sun protection is key and I have it. Certainly will be ordering again.

OMG I have the most sensitive skin and can't wear anything and my eyes get so irritated I have blurry vision and tearing so bad and burning for days after just one application, even childrens sunblock didn't help...until I read the reviews and said "what do I have to lose"...well Please believe me that it was money well spent....I will be wearing this forever!! It's that great...I applied it and even applied it around my eyes and waiting for the usual reaction of irritated, watery, burning eyes.....what !! No burning.....I'm sold....and I even applied my make up and shadow and mascara...and still no burning....the best part is it dried Matt but not dry and does not give you the gray ash look to your skin....buy this it's worth every penny.....you won't be disappointed.

I’ve never used any sunscreen before so this is my first product to protect my skin. I see a lots of reviews about this and decide to give it a try. For few days using this my skin around the chin area got rash and itchy. I’m very worried b/c my skin is kinda sensitive and will turn out very bad. I don’t say this product is bad but for who’s looking for a sunscreen and you never try it please be careful find a sample first before purchase.

The media could not be loaded. I have been using EltaMD since the summer and very pleased with it. It came as a recommendation from my Dermatologist. She explained the benefits of the ingredients that this has such as the Zinc Oxide. This will give you proper protection from the sun. I have been using it while active and sweaty and not having any issue with burning in my eyes. It smells good and does not have a greasy feel to it. I highly recommend this sunscreen if you want to properly protect your skin.

I have very oily, acne prone skin and most sun screens just made me look worst, did this take away my oiliness NO but it didn't add to it. I tried it for a week and so far, no break outs and as a black woman, it melts into my skin, disappears with out that white cast.

Needed good sun screen to use while jogging. I sweat a lot from my forehead and needed something that would come off and sting my eyes. This product has been awesome. Dosnt come off. It dosnt have that gross sun screen smell. I have rosacea which makes my face very sensitive to most products. This sunscreen is the only brand I’d use.

eos-eos

Yes. It was pricey. Recommended to me by a dermatologist and a friend. Walmart sunscreens ALWAYS make me burn or break out. This did not. I also used the sport sunscreen and it worked so well the only places my husband got burned was where he didn’t bother to apply it. I didn’t burn at all and we were in the open sun ALL DAY. I have enough to use it again several times next summer and that’s after 8 people using it to reapply several times. It’s not greasy feeling and the sport is legit waterproof. Couldn’t wash it off my hands but it wiped off on a towel or something. Note: I also wore a long sleeve UV shirt, river shoes, and a goofy wide hat that looked a lot more attractive in the picture but did the job as advertised. I did take them off for a while to swim easier and my son fell asleep in the boat so he wore the hat for a while. So $35 for a bottle of sunscreen you can use quite a few times or a doctor bill for skin cancer removal on your FACE? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Note: the sport kind wasn’t so protective I didn’t get sun at all. My freckles are noticeably darker so it’s good for getting the vitamin D without the skin cancer. My friend also pointed out that our skin was noticeably moisturized and softer than before. That is all. I will be using it again.

eos-eos

It’s easy to a spread and feels like a moisturizer on my skin. It has no fragrance which is important to me because I’m allergic to a lot of perfumes.  I have just begun to use this product for sun protection so it’s too early to report on how protective it is, but at least it’s not that thick stuff with artificial fragrances that aggravate my asthma.

eos-eos

I’ve been using his sunscreen for years now, my dermatologist and esthetician both recommended this line of products and I love them. The sun screen doesn’t smell as strong as most sun screens and it doesn’t feel heavy on the face. It’s very light and if you suffer from acne like I do then this is the right one for you, I use the sport because I feel it keeps my face protected for longer without re-application. The best part is that it doesn’t clog your pores. I wear this on a daily basis and my skin appearance has improved over all.

I've used this product for the past several years and I am so glad I discovered it. I use it for my face as it's cheaper than the facial sunscreen from the same brand. I have problems with makeup, moisturizers and sunscreen that cause my eyes to burn and water and I haven't figured out what ingredient is causing it so I go by trial and error. This sunscreen does not have that effect on me. It just offers great protection and great moisture. You might say it's a bit greasy at first, but it does sink in and it has not caused any skin reactions or other problems. It is my 'go to' sunscreen for my face. I use cheaper, drugstore brands for my body when it isn't as critical with no problems, but for my face, this product is the only one I'll use.

I like Elta MD products, and have been using sun-screen for more than 40 years. I bought thi because I like the high SPF number and because it's unfragranced, important for me. I'm not fond of zinc oxide, as excellent a sun-barrier as it is, because it always goes on thick and white. This is no exception. Remember those pictures of hunky ski instructors with thick white goo all over their noses? That's zinc oxide. It's the best sun-screen there is, but it's hard to work with.  One of the worst things you can do to your skin is rub and tug. Unfortunately, when you wear a sunscreen with high SPF zinc oxide in it, that's probably what you're going to have to do, unless you want to go around with a white film on your face. I don't.  This product is a thick cream. I rub it between my palms to warm and loosen it before use, but it still goes on thick and white and requires some rubbing to make it disappear. Not for me.  I've used the Elta MD Broad Spectrum SPF 40 that comes in the 1.7-oz. pumper bottle. It's also zinc oxide but it's much looser and I prefer it to this. I'm willing to go with a lower SPF to save my skin from the rubbing.

This product was recommended as a safe product by an author who wrote a book about women's fertility and egg quality. This product contains no harmful chemicals and is safe to use for women who are trying to conceive or conserve fertility in general. The product is very easy to apply and protected us from sun during our Hawaii trip. It does not feel greasy or sticky. It gives us this clean feel. Most importantly, you know it's safe to apply on your skin and your body is not absorbing harmful chemicals like other brands on the market. I highly recommend to anyone for its safety.

This is the best sunscreen I have ever used so far. It stays on all day long. I have oily skin and it doesn't make my skin oily, protects my skin from the sun and is water resistant.

This is a great product. I have one tinted that I use. I am fairly light so I can use this for sunscreen and a makeup for daily wear. The one that is not tinted can be used if I don’t want a tiny. My husband uses it as well. Goes on clear, no greasy. I love them both. I have sensitive skin( Rosacea)

eos-eos

Light weight, I use it every day per the request from my Dermatologist. I am fair skinned and the sun is not my friend. This helps since I work outside 8 hours a day

eos-eos

This sunscreen is great for two reasons: 1) it includes both chemical and physical blockers for UVA & UVB and 2) they've figured out how to get the physical blockers to rub in. This was always the problem in the past -- if you put zinc oxide (or something like it) on, you wound up with a white film Not with this product. I love it, and you don't find those two qualities in almost any mainstream sunscreens. Your skin is definitely worth the splurge.

eos-eos

That awkward moment you learn you have PMLE (an allergy to the sun). Being outdoorsy and living in SoCal, it’s not an ideal diagnosis. I did research that landed me on this sunscreen. I take other precautions, but haven’t had any reactions from the sun since using it!

eos-eos

My esthetician recommended it. I accidentally ordered the body version while shopping for the face version but I used it on my face, anyway with no breakouts. I also used it on my body and now it's all gone. I have many unfinished tubes of sunscreen that I stopped using because I broke out or the consistency wasn't comfortable. But this has now gone up $5 from the last time I bought it. I'm watching you, Elta.

eos-eos

I’ve been using this product for a while as I recently formed some sun spots in my face. My fiancé recently tried it out when he left his sunscreen and he is sold more on this product. The product he was using previously he had to really like every 30 mins and he would still get red. He’s blown away by how well this works for him.

I was hesitant to try another mineral based sunscreen as I recently tried a lower spf mineral sunscreen from a drug store brand and it was like a WHITE MASK, absolutely terrible. Then I learned about mineral sunscreens WITHOUT the titanium oxide, aka this Elta MD sunscreen, and decided to give it a try. It is amazing, not thick at all and goes on like a dream. Best of all, no white cast and seems to melt/disappear right into the skin. Absolutely no irritation or anything- can't even feel it on my skin. Love that it is such a high SPF with no white cast or irritation. Happy to have found my new holy grail of SPF!

eos-eos

Unlike the face sunscreen, the body lotion does not flake or pill. It absorbs very well and works excellent. Probably the best body sunscreen I've ever tried. Love this stuff. I can't say the same for the SPF 46 face sunscreen from same brand. It left a mess on my face of pilled/flaky lotion residue.

eos-eos

My favorite thing about this sunscreen, in addition to the invisible zinc oxide, is that it makes my skin look amazing in photos. Usually it’s the opposite with sunscreens that have mineral content. I would wear this even if I didn’t need a sunscreen. I put it on my face and neck daily. It’s a little pricey so I use less expensive stuff elsewhere. I also like that it is scent-free and never stings my eyes. (I don’t usually leave reviews.)

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen, I've been using it for years. I can only use mineral sunscreen for my face or I get dermatitis breakouts. This sunscreen absorbs easily, doesn't leave a whitecast (for me) and this bigger tube is "cheaper" than some of Elta's other sunscreens that are only for your face. This one can be used for both. It provides amazing protection as well.

This was recommended by my dermatologist. It's great!! We've been on 3 trips this year where we knew we would be outside in the sun a lot. We used the sunscreen, and despite being out in direct sun 8+ hours each time, we did not get sunburned at all!! All that happened is that we got a little browned. In fact, I missed a spot on my leg at a day at the beach. That spot is the only place that got sunburned. No where else where the sunscreen was put on. Highly recommend!

eos-eos

I use this sunscreen year round. I love a great tan but can’t torture my skin with one anymore. Best sunscreen I’ve used for my past oily skin and current dry skin. Smooths on nicely and doesn’t leave a bad smell or sticky feel. Before Covid it went under my makeup well and during Covid it looks great with no makeup.

I've had multiple skin cancers and need to use sunscreen every day. I had been using a moisturize with SPF 15 which really wasn't strong enough, but could never find a stronger one that didn't irritate my eyes.  My dermatologist gave me a sample of the SPF 50 Sport/Waterproof formula and I was delighted that I could tolerate it. I ordered the SPF 50 formula for Florida where I'm in the sun daily and swim regularly and the SPF 45 formula for my days in New York where I spend most of my time. It has a little lighter texture.  When applied, initially it feels a little thick and leaves a white film both of which go away quickly. All the formulations have zinc which is provides good protection and is likely the cause of the initial white film.  I've recommended this to my other fair skinned friends.

eos-eos

I won't use anything else. This brand covers nicely without feeling oily. No smell. Can wear under makeup. If you accidentally order the tinted one, (like I did), don't worry, it will not make a difference. My dermatologist office suggested this sunscreen. I've been using it for over 10 years. I wish I had started using it in my twenties!

eos-eos

This is not irritating at all around the eyes. Also no white cast on my caramel skin. Its thin as well. So no thick heavy layer. But it's shiny. So I just add a little pressed powder over it after application. Most affordable sunscreen I've found that has no white cast and no irritation. I only use this on my face.

I have used this product before and rebought it. Not only great protection against sunburn, but also absorbs quickly into the skin so sweat does not make it messy. Not the cheapest, but the best sunscreen I've used.

For an effective sunscreen, this isn't super greasy. To put it on a spectrum, I rate is as less greasy than Neutrogena, but more than Olay regenerist 30SPF serum. I wear this daily along with the Olay serum. They seem to work well together and have complementary ingredients.

eos-eos

I love this for my body SPF. I even use it on my neck and chest, because it doesn’t stain clothing like my tinted face SPFs. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t feel sticky at all.

This worked great for my trip to Florida! Used it on my face and arms and didn't burn at all!! Even after spending most of the day in the pool!!

The best. I will never use another brand of sunscreen. I personally worship at the altar of sunsceeen, but even for my friends and family who don’t, they like this too — it helps that it doesn’t smell or feel like sunsceeen. FYI, I also use their PM moisturizer and highly recommend that as well. (However I do not personally like their AM moisturizer so I use the PM one at both times of day.)

I live on a tropical island where sun, wind, water-they're all part of my life and I'm constantly needing real protection for my skin. This is the one. It is zinc based but absorbs easily and lasts for up to a few hours. I use it whenever I'm planning a day at the beach or a boat ride. I use a lighter product for everyday but really, I can't live without this one.

Excellent product for sensitive skin/eyes. No perfumes and doesn’t sting. Also, this works well with all of my foundations (IT Cosmetics, Sephora, Chanel and Tarte) and doesn’t pill. Coverage is very sheer (slightly pink) but doesn’t show under foundation.

I was referred to this brand by another golfer pal and now it is the only Sunscreen I will use on my face. I can play a 4 hour round of golf in the Florida Sunshine (full time resident of FL) and it does a great job protecting me from the intense damage that can result from those nasty UV Rays. I am fair and thus quite susceptible to sunburn. My only thought is that I wish it were a bit more reasonable priced.

Everytime I used sunscreen I would get these tiny little bumps all over my skin. After 6 months of use I'm ecstatic to report that I've had no incident. There is a slight white cast but once it absorbs it goes away. I adore this product I have dry skin and it moisturizes it as well, excellent for pre make up applications

Being a woman of color with lupus, I struggled with finding a great SPF for my face that lasts long and does not have white cast after applying.... THIS DOES THE JOB!!!! I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen for my face and so does my skin. Does not break me out and it is nice and lightweight!

It really protects from the sun, is not greasy and easy to distribute it around the face.

I have been using Elta sunscreen products for years, as recommended by my dermatologist. I purchased this one specifically for a pacific coast fishing trip on the Panamanian equator last month. Worked like a champ! The additional expense of Elta over cheap sunscreen is worth it by a long shot. It protects your skin from the harmful sun rays but also ensures me that I don’t end up with oily skin and complexion issues after multiple days of sun screen use.

Fellow men if you are looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t look like you’re wearing sun screen then this is the one you’re looking for. I spent a lot of time researching for a sunscreen that won’t leave my face looking white or anything that’ll give the impression that I’ve applied something to my face.This is the only sun screen that I’ve found so far that does not have that effect! Trust me on this one!
