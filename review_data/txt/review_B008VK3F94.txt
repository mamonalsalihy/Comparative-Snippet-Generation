I used it for 3 days and my skin now looks very bad. I've been treating acne for 2 weeks already because of this sunscreen. Even tho it protects your skin but same time it cause you breakouts. Not for sensetive skin for sure. Horrible "after taste". My poor skin can accept only cleanser and moisturizer right now and nothing else.

I am sensitive to any fragrances in sun screen. Especially on my face. I have near zero allergic reaction to this sun screen. Best product I’ve found.

This worked great for my trip to Florida! Used it on my face and arms and didn't burn at all!! Even after spending most of the day in the pool!!

That awkward moment you learn you have PMLE (an allergy to the sun). Being outdoorsy and living in SoCal, it’s not an ideal diagnosis. I did research that landed me on this sunscreen. I take other precautions, but haven’t had any reactions from the sun since using it!

I'm sensitive skin and this sun protection are the best.

This is lightweight and good protection.

It is perfect for my skin but too expensive. Which it could be cheaper or be able to find some coupons since is I need for me. Overall, this is a great sunscreen.

I live in Florida and use this sunscreen daily.

I was so excited to try this out. I know that my dermatologist office promotes this brand, so rightfully so, I bought it off Amazon. I recently had a precancerous mole removed, so I’m trying to be extra cautious about protecting my skin. Unfortunately, my skin is breaking out in rashes on my face and arm after using this product. I’m almost praying that I got a faulty product. :( Extremely bummed out. Be safe and test it first.
