I’m African American so finding the perfect sun screen is tedious and challenging. This sunscreen is great for darker skin tones. No white residue. Gives my skin a shimmery glow!

Have dry skin? Use this! Have sensitive skin? Use this! Hate the smell of regular sunscreen? Use this! This product checked every box that I was looking for in a nice, strong sunscreen for sensitive and dry skin! Thank you!

I was looking for an everyday sun screen that wouldn't make my skin break out but also was not Zinc Oxide based because those lotions are way too thick to work with my skin. This Aveeno sunscreen is a great lotion; I use it in place of my final moisturizer. It is a thick lotion -- makes sense given it is SPF 70 -- but it feels dry when it has been rubbed in. No shine at all on your face when you're finished.

I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have dry skin and often have a hard time finding a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a scaly appearance. This one is just like a lotion, absorbing quickly and going on smoothly. We used it on the entire family at the beach for a week and no one got burned. It’s a bit pricey but completely worth it. I’ll probably continue to use it as my daily facial moisturizer under my make up throughout the year. Thank you, Aveeno and keep making this product!

I used this sunscreen in what I would consider one of the harshest sun conditions and it worked incredibly well! I was in the 2022 Houston Art Car show and sped-walked for about 4 hours in Houston's harshest sun 12pm - 4pm with no reapplications. This sunscreen held up very well to sweating and didn't make my skin oily or slick. It absorbs into the skin well and leaves it feeling dry, it did make my arms look just a little bit shiny but it wasn't oily, wet, or slick to the touch. There's a slight smell when you first apply the sunscreen but it's very light and it goes away after a few mins.

Fantastic sunscreen! Very light, and does not smell like you’ve been at the beach. You can put it on in the morning before work. If you like the beach smell: this product is not for you.  I know they make a face product, so don’t be a cheap-skate like me and use this on your face. If you do decide to, use it on your cheekbones and under. Do not get near your eyes like I did. Ouch.

I've searched for a while for a good lotion along with sunscreen. I want everything in one product for our AZ sun. This product is perfect. It is nice and creamy, not greasy. And it has very little smell to it as I am sensitive to smells. It is also less expensive than other products for this size. I am already ordering another couple bottles. Very, very satisfied with this product.

I love how I dont look like I have bad foundation on lol. Not too thick and I dont feel sticky. Will be buying this again

Nice light fragrance, moisturizing without feeling greasy. Really like this product! I haven’t worn it in the water for swimming so I can’t speak to whether it stays efficient after getting wet or not.

I have to use sun block on my face and neck every day. This product works well for this purpose.

we bought these a couple times for family vacation. No problem for kids 3-10 yrs old. Works great.

Love having hydrating cream added to my sunscreen. This simplifies my application process. The fragrance is pleasant.

I wore this on my face and arms for a week at Disney World. It beat 88 degree weather all day and I didn't even get a little sun burnt. The smell isn't bad, but it does have a slight sunblock smell.

This is the first time I am using this product. I have “mature skin” and this sunscreen has been doing an amazing job protecting my face from harmful rays, as well as providing added moisture to my skin. I have already recommended this product to many friends.

Best ever. Doesn’t dry out skin

Aveeno is awesome plus sunscreen too

see above

A truly excellent value in sunscreen. Aveeno is known for moisturizers and the addition of sunscreen is great. I use this every day.

Love it prove it's for a long time. It motorized while protecting.

It’s ok for dark skin but the 60 is better. Don’t ever get this in your eyes.

It parallels masculinity. No goofy smell. Easy to apply. Skin absorbs it quickly.

Daily moisturizer and sun screen. Absorbed well , non irritating to my skin.

Great sun screen

Excelente protector solar! Olor y textura muy buena.

This is one of the few sunscreens that feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen.

eos-eos

Great product. Easy to apply, does not feel sticky, and stayed on while in the pool. I haven’t had a bad experience with using Aveeno.

Very good cream not sticky at all. I love it.

Good protection

muy buen producto para la piel

My 9 year old boy love it, no white marks in his body.... now we are ready for summer

eos-eos

It truly combats hyperpigmentation

This very high SPF is prefect for the beach activity. We used it during the vocation in Hawaii.

eos-eos

Important note, it is water resistant but it is not waterproof, it is light, somewhat sticky but not too much, it is tolerable, it is not like your hair sticks to your face. But yes, it's shiiiny, for people with oily or combination skin it is something to consider if ur worry about what ur face looks like, I assume that if it does not affect the makeup it would be a good base for that glowy effect. it did not irritate me and it bothers me too little if it goes into the eye by accident, the feeling of sticky remains throughout the day for the most part, it has a pleasant aroma that is not strong, it is more like the smell of medicine mixed with perfume I know, it sounds bad but it's not at all what it sounds like.

I'm sure it's just me, but everytime I have used this Sunscreen product, my eyes sting and burn. I do like other Avenno products but not this one. I'm not returning this because I have used it.

eos-eos

It's SPF 70 so you definitely have to rub in for a long time to get rid of the white cast. Sometimes it can make one look a little ashy, but it does it's job.

The one that I received is not like a cream but is all curdled with oil separated. Whenever I take some quantity of the lotion out of the tube into my hands, I either get oil or curdled liquid that is not like cream. It looks like broken milk with lots of loose oil. I usually take some portion of any cream/lotion from the tube to my right fingers and apply it. I tried using this lotion twice in the same way and on the areas on my right hand fingers that got in contact with the lotion, my skin broke out very badly. Thank god I did not use it on my face/body fearing reactions for using a spoiled product or I could not imagine what should have happened. I'm very disappointed with the product.

eos-eos

I'm totally not used to putting anything on my skin so this review is probably tainted. While non-greasy, it did feel greasy to me. I did call Aveeno when I had a question and was told this product is now discontinued. So, my advice is don't get hooked on it or buy it up quick. I hope it works though

eos-eos

Works well for ppl with sensitive skin allergies to chemicals such as MCI. Provides good protection for the face. Is definitely way overpriced for the quantity provided.

eos-eos

I am a huge fan of Aveeno products and have never been disappointed until now. The fragrance was nice, but way too intense... I actually became physically nauseous after about 15 minutes and had to wash it off. Bummer! Will be returning.

eos-eos

Absorbs very quickly. Works like a moisturizer. No sticky feeling. Great product! Will buy again.

eos-eos

La verdad me irritó demasiado la zona de los párpados, su textura es demasiado pesada y grasosa

eos-eos

this worked great as a sunblock but terrible at moisturizing, easily transfers to clothes and furniture that leaves white marks wherever you go.

eos-eos

Great for body use not my face, which is What I got it for. It made my face feel like it was burning. I have sensitive fair skin. Love how it's not sticky/oily

eos-eos

Good for the body, won’t be using it for the face. I rushed to order it and didn’t realize ingredients are not as cleaned as i thought

eos-eos

Little bit expensive but product ok

eos-eos

It makes my face dry out

eos-eos

My boys and I did not like this product. As soon as we got wet the lotion began to run off our skin and leave white streaks on our bodies. Then, it got 8n my sons eyes after his face got wet. I do not recommend for use with water.

Poor. Watery
