If I could give 0, I would. This sunscreen advertised that it was reef safe. I bought over 50 dollars worth of it for my scuba diving trip because I wanted to be sure I wasn’t endangering the coral I was there to see. The sunscreen still contains Avobenzone and octisalate, which studies have shown to be VERY HARMFUL for the coral. I am very disappointed in the false advertising. Luckily my friend immediately said oh no, that brand isn’t reef safe, I read the label and she was right! They shouldn’t be marketing it as reef safe if it isn’t.

So I'm pretty white (as in "the lightest shade of any/all makeup is still too dark for me" white). And I don't like using a lot of chemicals on my skin. But I want to get a nice "base tan" so I don't fry on my cruise. In my research (SO MANY HOURS of YouTube and reading, heavy research) I noted several, seemingly reputable, people mentioned this product. It seems like everyone that knew what they were talking about all said the same thing: it smells good, it works, it moisturizes pretty well, and it's not filled with a bunch of chemicals. I tried it on my first tanning experience (natural tanning, sun only) and I didn't get burned! (I only laid out for 40 mins--20 front/20back). That's a lot for me since my skin hurts on a walk from my car to the front door on a sunny day. So if you're mistaken for a daywalking vampire, could use baby powder as a foundation, and/or love to smell tropical, this is the product for you!

Red hair, hazel eyes, freckles.... I usually burn at the thought of being outside for more than 15 min! And because that wasn't enough of a challenge, I have ridiculously sensitive skin. Hypoallergenic makeup makes me break out, and most cleansers leave me itchy dry. When Bullfrog quit making the sunscreen I had used since childhood, I panicked a bit. I recently went on vacation in the deep south, spent 3 days outside and barely got a tan line!! Even better - no rash. No sticky, tacky can't-touch-anything-for-fear-of-leaving-a-stain-residue. Very light coconut scent. The only challenge was the hotel floor (vinyl) ice rink after application. But it won't stop me from stocking up!

I will tell you I am very fair and on medication that makes me sensitive to the suns rays. I read review after review till I found this product which came with such high reviews from my fellow Amazonians, so I purchased it. LOVE, LOVE AND LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I was in the sun for about three hours and every where I put this product it did its job. My go to sunscreen this day going forward. My 5-year-old grand daughter used this product as well, same results after three hours and tons of pool time in Orlando Florida.

I had bought several of the sun bum sunscreens. This is my 2nd spray 50 SPF. I tend not to wear white suits when I use this spray. Instead I will use the the other lotions. The sun bum sunscreens are the best I have used as I tend to be in the sun every weekend living in the Caribbean. I've used the lotions, sprays tannin oil, browning oil, as well as the face sticks and lip sticks and they all offer great coverage from the sun. I have had no sun burn incidents when using these sunscreens. I've recommended their products to several of my friends and therefore I highly recommend this and the other sun bum sunscreens.

Well, I should've known not to try it with my son who has sensitive skin, eczema, and allergies. But it had good reviews for sensitive skin and said "hypoallergenic", so I thought I'd try. He took it to camp and came home with what I thought was a heat rash. Used the sunscreen a week later and it started burning him when I applied it. Then he got red welps and bumps everywhere I applied it (while outside in the sun). Now a few days later we are dealing with a terrible rash. I've used several cheaper brands of sunscreen with no issues before. But this one does have a scent (had to read ingredients). It may work for most people, but wanted to put this warning out there for people who have sensitive skin. It did work great on myself and others in my family.

I love this product!! I have finally found a product that doesn't cause me to break out in a rash. I have very sensitive skin and I'm sensitive to the sun. Most sunscreens cause me to break out in a rash however, this one does not. I have gotten sunscreen from the health food store that is for sensitive skin, however it doesn't actually protect me from the sun. This product does protect from sunburn. It does not irritate your skin. Also the scent is very pleasant and not overbearing. The only reason I did not give this a 5-star across-the-board, is because it asked if this is moisturizing. This does not dry my skin out, but it is not super moisturizing. I have purchased this in bulk for my family and shared with my friends. My mother and sister who also have sensitive skin have also found this send screen to be the one that works and does not irritate skin.

eos-eos

This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I have to be very careful because I literally blister in the sun. I generally stayed inside because I am so sensitive. The beach was out of the question. Most sun screens did not work very well, were grreasy, or smelled icky. This is smooth, goes on great, lasts a long time. I have even gotten compliments o how good my perfume smells, lol. I Highly recommend it.

I have extremely sensitive skin that is also very sensitive to sun exposure. During the last two summers I have had allergic reactions not only to the sun, but also to sunscreen that I purchased. I tend to purchase sunscreens with a higher SPF because of my pale skin and sensitivity, but haven’t been able to find anything over the years that doesn’t cause an allergic reaction besides BabyGanics, which is formulated for kids. This product is a game changer for those with skin sensitivity. I can put on my face (with my hands, NOT spraying) and I don’t get swollen eyelids or lips. I do not need to reapply every half an hour. Also, it smells great and had amazing coverage! I do still recommend rubbing in evenly and using sun care (shading, glasses, etc) along side it. But this is a miracle for my skin and the littles in my life like it too

great product. used the sun bum sensitive baby mineral sunblock on face (AWESOME product!) and used this product on the rest of body. very easy to apply. I do not generally use these types of spray sunscreens, however, location and type of vacation (beach camping) made this sunscreen the one I chose to try. I was very impressed with this sunscreen. I hardly ever write reviews, but I do when I really like a product..... that said-- this is by far one of the best sunscreens I've ever used. It did not irritate my skin at all. it did not feel heavy (I dislike heavy products) and the sun protection was top notch. the smell was not overwhelming or chemical AT ALL. my husband and I both used it and we swam in the ocean, spun poi on the beach, sweated and it was very effective every day we were on the beach and at our campsite, behind dunes. one bottle lasted us (2 adults) 4 whole days. (note: sun bum baby mineral sunscreen for sensitive skin was used for face) i will be purchasing this product again.

This smells very good and works very well as well. I was using it everywhere, but I don't think it's good on the face. I do have sensitive skin and I had a break out when I sprayed it on my face. I recently bought the sun bum face bar, and it works like a dream. The aerosol spray I re-ordered as well, because it's very easy to use for my neck, arms, and legs before I head out for a hike or ride, and the protection is equivalent to the Neutragena stuff I have if I put it on pretty thick. I also like it because the resulting spray cloud doesn't irritate my eyes or choke me out like the other brand.

We are strictly a Sun Bum family. Been using this product for years and I hate it when I can’t get a replacement bottle and have to rely on another brand!  These bottles run out fast for a family. However they go on well, last long, and provide great protection. We’ve also velvet had a faulty spray can which has happened with other brands. I am very fair skinned and anything over or under a 50 SPF does not work well. This when applied every two hours keeps me from burning.  We also use the Sun Bum zinc face cream for my daughters sensitive skin and it’s the only sunscreen product she can use. All other products make her under eyes raw, red, and irritated. Sun Bums zinc face cream is the best along with this 50 SPF spray!  Thank you Sun Bum!

Putting sunscreen on my kids was a struggle until I found this one! They always hated how oily the sunscreen was or how it smelled. This one was a game changer for my family! My kids love the coconut oil smell! This is the only product they let me out on them. In all fairness it does smell good! It also is a incredible sunscreen. We just went to the beach for a week and used this for several hours a day for 8 days. No one get burnt! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

We used this on our most recent vacation to Florida, and it worked really well. I applied it to my children and myself before we left for the beach, spraying it on and rubbing it in well. It left no residual white gunk and didn't feel sticky. It also doesn't smell bad. I reapplied after we had been in the water a little while. None of us got burnt, though we were at the beach for a few hours. I'll definitely by again. Also, both my children have sensitive skin and break out in a rash with certain products, and this didn't both their skin at all. We used it multiple days.

I just used this product today. Went out in Colorado 84F weather to do a photo shoot for senior pictures and did not want to burn like I usually do while taking pictures in the sun. This product was FANTASTIC! It is not greasy and the scent is great and not overpowering. Was out there for 2 hours and not one sign of redness. I love supporting businesses who give back and Sun Bum does amazing when it comes to giving back. Love to support them!

eos-eos

Has always been my favorite sunscreen purchase it from wherever I can find its cheapest. Living in florida its a priority for us to use reef save sunscreen we want to protect ourselves but also are temporarily swimming and enjoying the home of many species so its only respectful to use something that won't harm their environment.

I finally found a sunscreen I'm not allergic to. I usually fry and look like a lobster within 30 minutes of putting sunscreen on. I would blister and everything it was the worst. I used this and reapplied every 2 hours I haven't burned all summer. I even was in 4 different sun rays settings. I'm super impressed with this sunscreen. I will be buying this every year. It's worth every penny

Love this for sun protection. Recently discovered I have basal cell skin cancer(many years of not using sunscreen as I should've) and when I went searching for a great sunscreen, this was suggested. It'll be a regular purchase for me now.

I have super sensitive skin, this is great for me. Goes on clear, a bit oily but absorbs beautifully. Smells like coconut, which I love! No burning for me!!

My daughter is a pale redhead and sensitive to EVERYTHING from smells to fragrances in lotions. Sun Bum is the only sunscreen I have found that 1)stays on 2)doesn't burn her skin or eyes from fragrance (it has a gentle banana smell) and 3) works great! Prior to finding this I had to fight her to put sunscreen on, now its a a breeze. I use the lotion, stick and spray products.

eos-eos

This is the easiest sunscreen to apply and has been the gentlest for all our different skin types. There’s no white mineral layer. The scent is mild and fades quickly. Stop looking and comparing; this is the brand you want. Do you want spf 50 or 30? That’s your call.

Sunbum is so much less greasy than it then sprays! Effective without making you feel gross! Kept me sunburn free for a week at the beach

eos-eos

Smells amazing- so glad to find something that isn’t making me break out and gives me what I need! I’m so glad I found this company all their products so far I’ve tried have been absolutely amazing!

I know this product is expensive compared to Walmart paste, but it is so worth it. My skin doesn't get irritated and I don't get burned. I love using this on all my outdoor adventures with confidence that I won't get burned, nor will I affect the environment as negatively as cheap other products. Try it once and you'll want more if you spend a lot of time outdoors and use sunscreen regularly especially.

eos-eos

This sunscreen was great! Just used it on a vacation to the Caribbean and unlike some reef safe sunscreens it didn’t go on skin white, it was clear. I bought the 50 and I did not burn but did get some tan. There was no strong scent, it didn’t irritate my skin, sprayed on easily and I will definitely buy this again.

eos-eos

I have really sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate it at all and smells really good. It is on the more expensive side compared to other brands out there, but I think it's worth it. It gives good protection and doesn't feel slimy and greasy after applying it.

eos-eos

It only lasted my boyfriend and I one trip and a half to the pool because we are very pale and I’m pregnant so I have been burning quicker, but the price for the size of the bottle throws me off and I still got burnt. My boyfriend didn’t though so definitely going to try it out after I have baby.

eos-eos

I will NEVER go back to other sunscreen brands again! My children have been well protected with this sunscreen and have never burned once applied. My son that has very sensitive skin which usually breaks out behind his knees and on his arms has ZERO rash when using this product! It may be a little more expensive, but TOTALLY worth it!

eos-eos

This sunblock is the absolute best brand ive ever used! My kids use the 50 and up spf , i use 15 or 30 spf because i want to get a natural tan with the protection. It smells fantastic! Doesnt feel sticky. Makes my skin smooth. Its eco friendly which is a huge plus!

I bought this for my daughter, who is celiac. But, I noticed that it was recommended for scalps and hair. I burn so easily, I have been using it on my part-line and scalp when I swim, as well as using it for the rest of my body. It goes on great, is non-greasy, stays on while I swim and works good. I've never burned! And, it doesn't leave a film on my body or hair. Great product!

great sunscreen and good for the skin

My daughter is allergic to most sunscreens, especially sprays. Thought I'd give this one a try and we haven't had any problems. FINALLY one we can use and it smells amazing... we get complimented on how good it smells every time we're using it kinda banana/coconut scent. And I love that it doesn't have the harmful chemicals most sprays have either.

My friend yelled at me in front of children for not bringing ocean safe sunscreen on a trip. Good thing this stuff exists. Doesn’t make your skin too white like some reef safe ones do.

I work outside during the summer and this stuff definitely works. There would be days I'd forget to put it on certain parts of my arm or shoulders and I'd pay the price. The spots that had it on, completely protected. It helps develop a tan slowly. Great spray bottle, not too greasy, spreads easily and has a great scent to it.

Hands down, my favorite sunscreen I've ever used. It has a wonderful scent, goes on easy and provides excellent protection. I will never buy another brand of sunscreen.
