Love this for sun protection. Recently discovered I have basal cell skin cancer(many years of not using sunscreen as I should've) and when I went searching for a great sunscreen, this was suggested. It'll be a regular purchase for me now.

I have super sensitive skin, this is great for me. Goes on clear, a bit oily but absorbs beautifully. Smells like coconut, which I love! No burning for me!!

Wish it came in 100

It only lasted my boyfriend and I one trip and a half to the pool because we are very pale and I’m pregnant so I have been burning quicker, but the price for the size of the bottle throws me off and I still got burnt. My boyfriend didn’t though so definitely going to try it out after I have baby.

Bought to take on Vacation. NOT reef friendly.

The smell is great but it makes my face incredibly shiny and oily

The sunscreen would not spray, don’t buy online, waste of money

i’ve never left a review but this was so disappointing.  leaves residue immediately after application that rubs off as you’re spreading it across your skin, which makes it difficult to get even spf protection. need to spray at least twice to get adequate protection. parts of my back got sunburned.  stained the back of my new white linen shirt while sitting in the car.  product does not allow returns, very upsetting!

Does a good job
