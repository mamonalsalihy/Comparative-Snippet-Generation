I go back and forth between the Alba brand and the sun bum. Both are great and get the job done. Love the 2 pack of this though, perfect for boating season and I feel safe putting it on my kids. Great for our sensitive skin and making sure we’re protected!

I have used this sunscreen for 4 years. This is far the best sunscreen for me and my family. This is a safer option to use versus other products. It does the job. It is easy to apply, doesn't come off when I sweat. I don't have to reapply throughout the day. One application and I am good to go!

I did not follow instructions. I put it on, got in the water and it burned the hell out of my eyes. The next time I put it on, I waited the recommended half hour and had no issues. The white streaks seem like they don't rub out but they do, it just takes a bit more time than some other brands. If applied thoroughly ahead of time it is a very effective sunscreen. Definitely will buy again.

Love Sunbum! Our go-to sunscreen. Love the scent and protection. Also love that it's reef friendly.

Great sunscreen and extremely fast shipping!

I purchased a seasons supply of Sun Bum based on the reviews. I should have ordered one bottle as opposed to five. The product I received was thick and does not absorb well. It leaves a pasty film and if you get any of it even near your eyes you will experience stinging and tearing, like I did for hours. Unfortunately I cannot return and am now stuck with 5 bottles that I definitely will not use.

This is the best quality lotion on the market. Goes on easy gives and gives you an even tan, or no tan depending on the spf. Every suntan lotion has someone post a picture blaming the product, but I have not had a probem in 30 years and I always hand it out on the boat and people do nothing but praise it. Plus it smells amazing. What's better than a 1 bottle...2.

I switched my family to Sun Bum 3 years ago and have never gotten so much as a little pink from the sun since. We spend every summer on the beach in South Carolina, so intense sun all day long. I use this on my 2yr old - the ingredients are gentle enough although they do make a Baby Bum product that’s also great. It goes on thick, you need to take the time before leaving the house each day when there’s no sand involved or kids immediately running into the water and washing it off, to apply it all over - getting tops of feet and ears! One application if you give it the 15-30 mins to sink in will keep you covered all day. I am anti-spray sunscreen. Invariably it doesn’t cover the body as completely as lotion and everyone ends up getting burned someplace. Good old fashioned lotion rubbed in before going outdoors gives the whole family the protection you need from the sun. It smells amazing, and performs light years better than the junk you’re provably buying in the drugstore - I’m looking at you Banana Boat, Panama Jack, Coppertone, Nivea and Nutragena.

I had seen Sun Bum around for years, but never had used it until my friend and I went to Maui. She had raved about the product and liked its natural ingredients, so I decided to give it a try. A week in the Maui sun with Sun Bum spf 30 was quite an amazing experience! I rarely needed to reapply even after dips in the Ocean. Normally when I’m in the sun, my shoulders are the victims of burns and redness, but with Sun Bum spf 30- they were never red nor burnt! Sun Bum really lives up to its reputation by providing great protection that leaves you with an amazing tan. I was sold on Sun Bum the minute I used it and will continue to purchase it every season!

I really wanted to love this sunscreen. It has a great texture an goes on perfectly. Unfortunately, it smells exactly like you are in a sauna. (Sandalwood/Cedar? -very woody mixed with coconut). I didn't mind the smell at first, but it is not subtle, and it doesn't go away. By the end of the day I was sick of the strong scent.

Everyone in my family prefers to use this brand over any other. First order of two bottles I received expired the same month. I was able to get a refund to repurchase another set which have a much more reasonable expiration date.

We love Sun Bum products. We are family of 6 with kids from 19 to 4 with varying types of skin and sensitivities. This is one product everyone can use and be protected from harmful rays without any reactions or irritations. We are in the water a lot and it stays effective. Also smells amazing and doesn’t hurt the Earth.

Sun Bum. Recognized by all the tweens! Good for environment. Spreads easily. Apply frequently though…. Especially if in the water! I found out the hard way! The higher SPF the better.

eos-eos

I love love love love this sunblock. It is actually moisturizing, so my skin is soft and protected from the sun. It’s also reef safe, which is my number one requirement. I only wish they would make a sent-less one, but I still recommend this sunblock over all others.

This is the best sunscreen I have ever used! On our recent trip to Hawaii the family stayed virtually burn free. We were diligent about reapplying it and it worked wonders. This is some of the best sunscreen I have ever used. It is not too thick, goes on easy and smells good! This will be my chosen product from now on!

While this sunscreen provides great sun protection, I was really hoping this it would be a great moisturizing lotion. It falls short. My skin seemed like it was even more dry after I using it. I'm going to Jamaica in two weeks and we'll use up the rest of this sunscreen but I definitely would not buy it again.

Sun Bum makes fantastic sun screens in a variety of SPF strengths. The level of protection is extremely good no matter what SPF you may choose. I like the 30 for the pool and the 50 for more tropical sun. Smells good, has healthy ingredients, and spreads well on to the skin. Highly recommend!

I don’t know if this product is counterfeit or what but it doesn’t protect like the Sun Bum I bought from the store. We reapplied 2x in the timeframe recommended and both of my kids burned. Super disappointed with this purchase.

This is my favorite sunscreen. Dries quickly and does not feel greasy at all. I can apply once in the morning and not have to worry about it rinsing off in the water while I paddle board. This is the only sunscreen that keeps me from getting a sunburn. #pastywhitegirl

Love this brand. Smells great, goes on non-greasy. And most importantly protects my skin! It's more expensive than other brands but that's what you pay for to help protect yourself and the planet a little more.

Applies easy and smells delicious. Doesn’t work For wind burn but does screen out harmful rays.

I love the smell. It doesn't smell like sunscreen. The shipping was fine, no issues at all. The ingredients are better for you than most other brands.

We have been using this product for over a year now. We love the smell (sorry if you don’t like bananas). It works well for every activity (hiking,biking, skiing, swimming)

Sun Bum suntan lotions are really great ! Using them in Aruba right now, and have not had any problems with sunburn.

Firm believer in Sun Bum. Just got back from a week in Costa Rica...some people looked like lobsters. Not me...pale and white, just as I like it!

Our favorite and most effective sunblock - we travel a lot and this is the only sunblock we use. 30 SPF reapplied as needed is all we need for our fair skin close to the equator!

Love the way it smells, ike vacation in a bottle. Super great sun protection, even when its hot and your in the water

It has a mild coconut aroma and it spreads easy isnt greasy and is good for sensitive skin.

I love Sun Bum but you would be better off buying from a store mine was leaking all over. I was hoping to have a better experience then some of the other reviewer's.

I love sun bum but the bottles I received expire in July of this year.. I probably won’t go through 2 bottles of sunscreen by then..

eos-eos

One of the bottles cover arrived peeling off, like maybe it was damaged by heat or sun exposure. The brown cover peel off and the underneath is yellow. Also when you open the top there is not protective seal and the cream is exposed. Only one bottle was ruined . Seems like extreme heat made it peel. I just got this and was going to use it in Hawaii when I go in Sept.

Recd bottles and one was open. It had leaked on the box.

Received the bottles and they were covered with sunscreen. When I went to rinse it off the labeling peeled off like it was sunburned and it’s own skin was peeling. Can’t use it before our cruise in 2 days.

We love this sunscreen but are not happy with how they arrived - sunscreen had leaked all over the inside of packaging and the brown bottle cover was all shriveled and peeling off...

Consistently great products offered by this company. Trying the face cream and 3 in 1 hair product this time. This lotion provides great coverage and feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen lotion. Lip coverage is wonderful as well!
