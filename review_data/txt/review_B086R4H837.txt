I go back and forth between the Alba brand and the sun bum. Both are great and get the job done. Love the 2 pack of this though, perfect for boating season and I feel safe putting it on my kids. Great for our sensitive skin and making sure we’re protected!

I did not follow instructions. I put it on, got in the water and it burned the hell out of my eyes. The next time I put it on, I waited the recommended half hour and had no issues. The white streaks seem like they don't rub out but they do, it just takes a bit more time than some other brands. If applied thoroughly ahead of time it is a very effective sunscreen. Definitely will buy again.

Applies easy and smells delicious. Doesn’t work For wind burn but does screen out harmful rays.

Love Sunbum! Our go-to sunscreen. Love the scent and protection. Also love that it's reef friendly.

Everyone in my family prefers to use this brand over any other. First order of two bottles I received expired the same month. I was able to get a refund to repurchase another set which have a much more reasonable expiration date.

This is the best quality lotion on the market. Goes on easy gives and gives you an even tan, or no tan depending on the spf. Every suntan lotion has someone post a picture blaming the product, but I have not had a probem in 30 years and I always hand it out on the boat and people do nothing but praise it. Plus it smells amazing. What's better than a 1 bottle...2.

Sun Bum. Recognized by all the tweens! Good for environment. Spreads easily. Apply frequently though…. Especially if in the water! I found out the hard way! The higher SPF the better.

This sun tan lotion burnt my eyes so bad I couldn’t believe it. Took me back to the 80s paba days. My 4 yr old is in agony. Honestly, they shouldn’t be allowed to sell it I’ve never writtten a review here. This sucks.

Smells ok, that's the best part, it doesn't smell like chemicals. But as soon as you start sweating it gonna be running white all over your body, especially bad on darker skin. They don't even make the spf 15 in lotion form anymore for that exact reason. Because dark skin people said, hey! I look like an android bleeding white blood when I go to the beach! I guess this stuff is ok if you're really light skinned and just gonna sit there on a towel in 80 degree weather. But if you're gonna be moving around, having fun, sweating, in the sun . . . you're gonna wanna get a better product.
