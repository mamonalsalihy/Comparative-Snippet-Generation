Honest review here.  I struggled, especially living in Florida, finding a chemical free safe sunscreen that I loved. I have kids and want to make sure they are not only protected from the sun but also from harsh chemicals. I recently read an article (you can find if you google Dr. Axe sunscreen) and it has a list of EWG rated (good ones) of mineral and non mineral based sunscreens. There were very few spray ones on the list and this was one of them.  I can attest it works great but must apply well (as with any sunscreen). I love that it is spray and 50 and last for up to 80 minutes of swim time. SO, it's also waterproof! It was in my opinion one of the best on the list. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

Super disappointed. I am severely allergic to avobenzone and was super excited to find a spray sunscreen without that chemical. Just got it the mail and avobenzone is listed as the first ingredient. The pictures on this posting are not correct.

eos-eos

I ordered this because it has no avobenzone--zoom in on the Active Ingredients in the photos, there's no avobenzone. The cans that showed up at my house look exactly like these pictures, except that avobenzone is literally the first ingredient. Other ingredients are different, too. I assume Alba changed their product, but Amazon needs to change their description to reflect that.

I spent a lot of time looking for a sunscreen that followed my “rules” and this one fits them all!  -30spf or better -cruelty free -reef safe -non comedogenic (won’t clog pores/cause breakouts) -dries clear -feels light -wears well under makeup -costs less than $20  After using it for about a week, I HIGHLY recommend this sunscreen. I don’t often leave reviews but this product deserves some love!  I got this specifically to use in my face but now I’m spraying it on my arms and chest too since it is not overly expensive. One thing I’d recommend is to follow the instructions on the label to first spray the product onto your hands and then apply to the face. It has a very strong fume of alcohol but dries very quickly. I overapplied the first time I wore it and it burned my eyes—especially when I worked out and got sweaty!😅 I wore less the next day and was careful to avoid the skin around my eyes and have not had any further problems. It also mildly tingles/burns my skin when I first apply but I think it’s because I have very sensitive skin—it does not make me red and the discomfort goes away within a few seconds.  The other perk of this product is that it truly dries clear and leaves my skin looking dewy but not oily. It also wears well under makeup.  Great product!!

I bought this because we are headed for a vacation to a resort that prohibits traditional sunblock. You have to use reef safe, biodegradable so I thought this was the perfect product for us. I decided to try it out to be sure it was adequate as I planned to use it on my little ones. I applied 3 different times over a 3 hour period at the beach because I could feel my skin burning! The bottle feels almost empty just from the one day of use on 1 person. I ended up having to cover with a towel for the last hour I was there because I knew it was going to be bad. I was right. I’m still in pain and peeling 5 days later! This product did not work for me at all! I burned badly despite repeated applications.

The product contains Avobemzone, which stains clothing. On the photos in the description Avobemzone is not listed as an active agreement. Shocked Amazon allows this misrepresentation.

This stuff smells nice. It sprays evenly, and it doesn’t leave that lingering sunscreen smell on my skin. I am a woman of color with medium skin tone with yellow/golden undertones and almost every sunscreen leaves this weird lavender hue on my skin. I’m sure most people of color understand what I’m talking about. Because of this unnatural white/lavender cast left behind with sunscreen, I never wore it. I promised myself that I would be responsible and wear sunscreen this summer and this product helped me stick to that promise.  It sprays evenly, it smells okay (nothing to write home about), more importantly the smell doesn’t linger, it’s not too greasy although it leaves some oil behind it looks like a nice glow. The most important part of all, it’s totally clear going on! So my friends with melanin rejoice! No more lavender skin!  My only problem is that if there is the slightest bit of moisture on your hands when rubbing it in it creates this sticky film that’s nearly impossible to wash off. Even after applying the spray, when I would wash my hands it would create this awful sticky residue between my fingers no matter how much soap and water was used.  I would repurchase again, for the simple fact that it’s clear and it works. However, I wish that sticky feeling wasn’t an issue which is why I deducted 2 stars.

I love this sunscreen. I have tried every spray on sunscreen brand out there, however, my children all have very sensitive skin and would develop a minor rash(some worse than others) from all other brands of spray-on and lotion sunscreen(even the ones "for sensitive skin"). Alba Botanica's proves to be the most effective and safe for my children! It protects against sun damage, is easy to use, and does not cause any rash, it smells good, too. Will continue to purchase this product and only this product!

eos-eos

I have EXTREMELY sensitive and picky and weird skin. I can’t wear sunscreen and haven’t since I was about 7. It burns my skin in a way that one can only describe as a lemon juice face mask after you get don’t dermarolling your face. It freaking hurt. It left a chemical burn on my face and we think it was a reaction to the high concentrations of zinc and titanium dioxide in other formulas. I have tried others with a similar formula to this and they ALL burn. This one however DIDN’T. I don’t know why, I don’t particularly care. I will buy this IN BULK until I die. And then my ghost will put this in the carts of everyone that shops on amazon.

We love this product!! As a mother of two fair-skinned redheads with sensitive skin (as am I), this sunscreen is a life saver!!! I was tired of rubbing thick sunscreen on the kids every time we would go out (for less than 20 minutes🙄), so we would end up not even going outside - so I did some research & I found this spray-on for a good price!!!  No rashes/break outs, blisters from this product. I’m not sure about “moisturizing,” but I’ve never noticed it dry the kids skin out, so I’d say it does a good job!

eos-eos

Originally found this brand at Costco in Maui during our trip. I had brought one can of another brand with me, but didn’t know about reef safe laws there. I was hooked from first use just based on the smell! I applied 30 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapplied after any ocean/pool swims and never once even turned pink! My skin is very very white, especially my legs, and this provided amazing protection. I live in Central California and the sun here will sizzle your skin instantly on most summer days, but I’ve had fantastic luck with this. Wore it yesterday for 3 hours (9 miles) of kayaking with no shade and sizzling sun and it worked perfectly. Just rebought 5 cans this morning. The can even sprays upside down 😊

eos-eos

Expensive, but worth it. Gets a good rating for low-toxicity ingredients, plus goes on so easy, and didn't cause breakouts on sensitive skin like some others have. Perhaps most impressive is that after trying many of these, this is the only one that dries quickly and is so non-greasy that I didn't even have to wash my hands to keep a grip while push mowing - which is great for finally protecting hands from the sun too.

eos-eos

Alba Botanica is my favorite brand for sunscreen products and it checks all the boxes on my list: Excellent long lasting coverage, fine mist spray and easy coverage cream versions, great for my sensitive skin (no breakouts- I do NOT use it on my face though), the Hawaiian fragrance is pleasant, it’s reef safe (a big one for me as a snorkel/dive aficionado), and organic ingredients. The large size lasts 5 full days when on a boat all day in the Carribbean, and I only apply it twice (once in morning, and again midday.) I have fair skin, and I never burn. The spray version is, by nature of its aerosol capacity, a bit drying on the skin, but this is to be expected, and it creates a long lasting barrier. The cream version is a wonderful emollient, although not quite as long lasting. Best deal is only in the summer season at CostCo for a 2 pack... in my searches, Amazon has the best deal otherwise.

eos-eos

I wanted a sunscreen that isn’t tested on animals but also isn’t 30 dollars a bottle. I also hate the smell that pretty much all sunscreens tend to have, but thankfully this one doesn’t. Has a slight chemically smell upon first applying it but goes away quickly, and as I work outside in the extreme Florida heat it doesn’t sweat off or leave any kind of greasy feeling which prevents dirt and grime from sticking to me. Thank goodness! This will be my go-to sunscreen from now on.

Beyond performing as advertised, this product has some pretty cool properties. For openers, there is very little residual scent, which means I can wear this product AND my cologne of choice. The spray mist provides fairly even coverage, which is a good thing given that the product dries so quickly. With that in mind, work fast when using your hands to apply the product to your face. Finally, my arms have a tendency to break out when I wear sunscreen for long periods of time, applying more and more as I go. So far at least, I have had no such issue with Alba Botanica Sensitive Sunscreen Spray. Oh, and did I mention, it's also an effective sunscreen? It is! Works as promised. Definitely worth a try.

eos-eos

This is great it worked amazing it’s still very full after hours in the pool so that’s a bonus! Also the smell does not smell like any other sun spray with parfum artificial fragrances it smells very clean it has no fruit or flavor-y spray smell like a air freshener it just smells clean like you can use this and it makes your skin feel safe from parfum and bad ingredients for your body so this is probably the best sunscreen! My skin and my sisters skin is sensitive so that is true! And just to be clear I ordered the fragrance free version that says new look. I hope this helps :)

eos-eos

One of the most important things about sunscreen is that you have to reapply it if you are going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time. Too many people just want to apply once and then be out for 8 hours. This variety is easy to apply and has a very nice fragrance. I'm a very pale person and I love this brand. My only criticism is that when I spray it into my hands so I can swipe it on my face, it does leave a residue on my hands. That's great if you are looking for something that holds up under water and sweat, but it's a bummer for glasses, sunglasses or picking up beverages! The most important thing is wearing it so grab some of this!

I took this sunscreen with me to South Africa and it really did a great job. I didn't get sunburned. It is not greasy at all, it is a very light mist-- so light I was at first skeptical that it would work well. It is truly fragrance free-- there is no odor at all. I like it so much, I bought more when I returned home from my trip.

eos-eos

I bought this sunscreen specifically for a Florida beach vacation since it is reef safe. I will continue using it though because it is such a great product! I have very sensitive skin and always use sunblock spf 50. With other products though I often still get sunburnt or have a bad break out or rash. I didn't get a sunburn or break out to this sunscreen. I used it on my children too and they really liked the smell. I didn't think it had much of a smell which I liked. Definitely buy this prodcut!!

eos-eos

Works perfectly! Smells great and does provide a bit of moisture.  Only note: If you play a sport with a helmet, go easy around the forehead and eyes as it can drip with your sweat into your eyes. Although, this has only happened after several hours in 85-95deg weather.

Will update on effectiveness when used. I purchased this with the intent to use this in Mexico as a biodegradeable, coral safe sunscreen. It is not. Avobenzene is not reef safe. Once I researched a bit, chemical sunscreen isn't biodegradable/ocean safe, only physical barrier sunscreen is. Since I can't return it, I'm stuck using it. We will use this in the pools at home.  There needs to be some regulation on what is allowed to be labeled as "biodegradable" it's misleading to consumers.

eos-eos

This is my favorite sunscreen. Unfortunately I did not use it until June 17th, one day after the deadline to return it. Out of the 3 bottles, 2 of them were so difficult to spray that I threw them away. Something was wrong with the sprayer top. My loss.

eos-eos

This is my second order for 2 cans and in each order one can Will Not Spray. Why can’t I get a replacement??????? I paid for a functional product and did not get it!!

eos-eos

I have sensitive skin and allergies to common preservatives. That limits the products I can use. Thankfully this one doesn’t have any of those ingredients, so I was able to use it several days out in the desert sun. No sunburns!!! Yay! And no skin irritation! Yay! Like a lot of sun screens, it looked like my skin was all oiled up. No problem, I don’t mind showers once I’m out of the sunshine to take care of that.

eos-eos

I am outside and sweating a lot at high altitudes (I live at 7,000 feet) where the sun/UV exposure is strong, so sunscreen is an absolute must-have. This sunscreen doesn't sting my eyes when sweat starts getting in my eyes so it has become my go-to. Can't wait to see how it holds up next time I am in the ocean scuba diving but being reef safe is also a huge plus. Originally found it at the big box that starts with a C on sale back in the spring but now I am regularly re-ordering here. I would add, the spray does not sting my eyes but the cream does. Weird.

eos-eos

We used this sunscreen in the Maldives and it works great. I got burned only on the first day of our trip when I forgot to apply the sunscreen to my arms before going in the water. Any time I used this sunscreen it worked really well at protecting my skin from the burning sun. Will be buying more for this summer.

eos-eos

I love spray sunscreens, but recently many of our travel locations have been banning different brands due to the harmful chemicals in them. Fortunately, this brand of sunscreen is safe for my skin, but also the reefs around where we vacation. Easy to apply, and your skin stays hydrated from the moisture in the sunscreen. Highly recommend.

eos-eos

This item is NOT accurately listed. I need a sunscreen that contains NO Avobenzone, and the ingredients *show* it contains none. However, the product arrived with a different label listing Avobenzone as the first ingredient. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money even though there is a no return policy for this item.

eos-eos

I love these sunscreen. Bought it for the first time at Costco and now continue to buy. I cannot be out in the sun so this helps out a lot. The best part about this product is that it doesn’t have that “suntan lotion” smell. I wear the 45 spf every day on my face and don’t have to worry I smell like suntan lotion. As always, you need to reapply but I find this product is great for me. And it biodegradable - when in Mexico if we do the swim with the dolphins they don’t want you to wear suntan lotion as it harms the water and dolphins and this is perfect.

My family used this for our first trip to the beach this year. It was chilly out so we were wearing T-shirts & shorts the entire weekend. It was very easy to apply. It smells nice but most importantly none of us got sunburned. That’s the whole point, right? It works & I’ll buy it again. I enjoy writing honest reviews for my fellow Amazonians and I hope you find this review helpful.

This is my favorite spray on sunscreen. I’m picky about sunscreen ingredients, and I will typically use lotions over sprays because of fewer questionable ingredients. But sometimes I want the convenience of a spray, so this is my go to spray. My son and I have very sensitive skin, and we have never had problems with this. Plus, it smells great! There is a bit of a sticky feeling sometimes after spraying, but it quickly goes away.

eos-eos

I know it is important but in getting ready to head outside in the heat, the last thing I looked forward to doing was slathering myself with a sun tan lotion type sun screen that would start to melt and run into my eyes and burn them and cause my makeup to run -- and just after I've gotten outside to work. THIS is a refreshing change. And I don't mind at all the extra step of spraying myself with a fragrance free cool blast of sunscreen. Bought one for my brother, too, and he's a fan.

eos-eos

This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used. This sunscreen stays a bit oily on your skin so I don’t recommend using too much on your hands before something like kayaking or paddle boarding. However the oiliness is what helps it last so long. My family is very active outdoors and we practically live at the beach during the summer. Since finding this sunscreen no one in our family has had a sunburn since.

eos-eos

Love this sunscreen! Super easy, all angles spray. Product feels really good on skin, soothing and light smell which is great. Great coverage but lightweight. Love the packaging and have bought multiples of this over the summer. I hike a ton and really good for mountain hikes in hot weather - never sticky, greasy or messy. Would highly recommend!

eos-eos

Just as stated, keeps sun off skin even in the ocean. No sunburn or irritated skin...for the fairest of skins. My husband always burns through whatever product we have used in the past. NOT with this however!! Kept the sun off for hours even when body surfing in the ocean. Pleasant smell too. Will be buying more of this for the entire famy.

eos-eos

Finally a CLEAN spray sunscreen that works! This goes on clear and really protects you from the sun. I was in the sun for hours without reapplying and did not get burnt. The nozzle does not clog either. This is going to be my go-to for the family all summer.

eos-eos

Used this at our first MLB game of the season and it worked really well. My husband and I both have Irish heritage so we’re really fair and burn incredibly easily. We applied the spray before heading to the game and then probably twice in the 5 hrs we were there- went on quickly, no strong smell and not super sticky or greasy. No burns for either of us and tbh 2 days later I don’t even really look like I was in the sun at all which is very unusual. Did not use this on our faces so can’t speak to that but I will definitely buy again as a body sunscreen!

eos-eos

I’ve been using this for years. It is one of the only sunscreens that my whole family can use. There are 6 of us and I was getting tired of a carrying around a bunch of different sunblocks. This one fits the bill for all. I usually use a face stick for faces just so I don’t have to spray where they can inhale, but if you spray it into your hands to apply it is comfortable on your face too.

eos-eos

I have severe eczema on my neck which makes the skin very sensitive. It is practically odorless and very gentle; I experienced no irritation at all. Definitely worth the price!

eos-eos

The protection from this was awesome. Seen a few complaints but not here! Spent a week in Mexico and it was the only my group didn’t get burnt using. I’m pregnant so the smell didn’t really do a whole for me unfortunately. It didn’t bother my skin but I used something else on my face so I don’t know how it does as far as stinging. Also love the fact that it’s air powered not aerosol

eos-eos

This is a great sunscreen that doesn't have all the nasty chemicals & additives that are banned in several states due to the harm they cause watersources & animals. We live in the high desert of southern oregon & northern california, where it regularly gets 100+ degrees in the summer, and this sunscreen lasts for hours in direct sun, holds up to sweat, and applies quickly and evenly. This and the lavender scented lotion sunscreen from Alba are the only sunscreens I buy.

eos-eos

Reef safe, Skin Cancer Foundation-approved (for Active use!), easy and convenient spray, waterproof, what's not to love? The coconut scent is noticeable, but much preferable to the chemical scent of most sprays. I switched to the clear unscented version of this, but am still using up the coconut cans that I already bought. I spend most weekends skiing, cycling, fishing and backpacking in the high-altitude Utah mountains and this stuff comes with me 24/7. No problems with stinging my eyes, pilling on my skin, staining clothes, clogging, etc. Just an even, clear spray every time.

I am the laziest adorable panda when it comes to rubbing stuff on my body so if I ever can find a spray to use instead of a creme well color me ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  This item works well, the price is great, and you can just bam bam bam face, legs, arms, buttcheeks, shark bait ooo haha and be done in a matter of seconds.  The scent is adorable it's enough to say hello but knows not to linger!

I'm fair skinned and freckled so I must wear sunscreen and finding g a product without harmful chemicals is a must. Well this product was a goid find. It even stayed on after getting into water. I was out in the sun for 9 hrs and only sprayed twice. My family ended up using mine because they had the bad chemical sunscreen. I had to order another 1 when I got home. Love this product.

This had me at coconut. I love coconut. It smells great and works great as well. I used the entire bottle on myself and my daughter while we were in Florida. No one burned.

Awesome product, however prefer cream for better coverage of teenagers visiting Florida from up north. Can be difficult to tell where it's actually been applied and incur a streak of sunburn.

I am not aware of any moisturizer in this sunscreen, but the spray (though cold) is convenient. I can’t comment on chemicals contained in the sunscreen because I haven’t looked at the ingredients. The convenience trumps other worries

Awesome product. Great price! Started using this last year on my son with sensitive skin and allergies. Stays on for a good hour, even in water. Highly recommended.

I burn to a crisp every time I spend more than 10 minutes out in the sun! So, I took the Alba Botanica Hawaiian with me last year on my trip to Treasure Island, FL. The only time I burned is when I FORGOT to reapply it out on the beach. It sprayed very nice and evenly and smelled divine! It never felt greasy or tacky. I love this product!

eos-eos

Great sunscreen and I didn’t even burn after over 10 hours out at the beach in the Cancun sun. I did reapply every hour vs every 90 mins. I also use this with the cream for my face. You will not get a lot of color using this since it’s an spf 50. So if you want to get darker use a lower spf and then switch over to this after a couple of hours.
