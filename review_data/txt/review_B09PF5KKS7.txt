Summer is here and I finally got a chance to try this sunscreen tanning oil while I was outside doing some chores. Although I used to be a sun worshipper, I have not been out in the sun match during the past few years, for a variety of reasons, so I needed some protection. I found this to go on the skin and absorb rather quick, and not feel greasy. My skin did feel moisturized once it soaked in, which didn't take long. I was in and out of my house for a couple hours, on a hot sunny day, albeit late in the afternoon, and I did not get any sunburn, so that is great! (I honestly can not speak for how well it works regarding being out in the sun for extended amount of time during the higher UV times earlier in the day.) The ingredients are supposedly safe to use as well, and I will have to trust that, even though this is a pressurized spray, and not a squirt pump. And yes, it smells like the old sunscreen we grew up with, a little like light bug spray. This said, it doen't smell bad... just typically classic. My only real complaint is the spray nozzle button itself... I had a very hard time one handed (fingered) spraying this product. It took all my finger strength, and it's not all that easy if you are trying to aim it onto your own back. I wrote to the selling company about it and they were very generous about working with me and they sent me some replacement product. Kudos to their customer service, thank you! However, I am not finding this new shipment being any easier easier to spray. The top does have a nice turning locking design, preventing spilling or spraying while carrying, but I just wish that it was easier to push down.

The spray got on my bathing suit & completely ruined it. Coopertone you should replace my suit!!! This never happened before I used spray for years.

Coppertone is a brand we are confident in. We are always happy with the quality and effectiveness of their products. We really like this sunscreen. It has a nice lite feel to it. It hasclassic Coppertone scent.  I tan well and have a little darker skin so I feel like I get good protection from lower SPFs. I know Coppertone has discontinued the very low SPFs but I feel like 15 is the perfect middle ground.  We are working really hard to only use mineral-based sunscreens, I see that this lacks some of the chemicals that are known to harm sea life and coral reefs but I'm not sure about what the new active ingredients are and how they are for the environment.  Overall very happy with the "Coppertone Tanning Sunscreen Spray, SPF 15 Broad Spectrum Tanning Sunscreen, Water Resistant Sunscreen, 5.5 Oz, Pack of 3".

I love these sprays. They are so easy to apply and you don't have to get your hands dirty. Of course you can rub it in but I just spray and go. I put it on about minutes before I go outside. I love the way it smells and it applies evenly. Just remember this is not a sunscreen and don't tan too long in one sitting, you will burn. This 3-pack is a great deal and will last you the whole summer. I keep one inside my beach bag that is always ready to go. I would definitely recommend this.

At 15 SPF make sure you realize this is for those with darker skin. The higher the number the better protection. 15 offers little protection. This is also available in 8 SPF. Sprays on nicely but it's best you not spray your face. Spray some on your hand and wipe it on. Helps skin brown nicely without burning. I've not used it swimming yet (too cold) but I have kayaked with it and I get plenty well. Seems to stay on well.  Highly recommended

The Coppertone you know and love! I use this on my legs and sometimes arms once I've had some sun exposure. I use Coppertone SPF 50+ for the majority of my body. We must be sun-aware!  Great scent. Not greasy. Easy application. LOCKS! So just toss this sucker in your bag and enjoy your day and protect your stuff and get a "healthy" glow.  Sun responsibly, folks! Coppertone will help you with that!!!

Applies nicely on my skin. It sprays evenly. Doesn’t leave any residue like other sunblock tanning sprays. Not too oily which is good. The spray top has a safety lock which you close by twisting the top to prevent the spray from accidentally going off and wasting the product. Just make sure you re apply when you are out in the sun to keep your skin protected. Great product and value.

This is a refreshing spray sunscreen with a mild scent. It's easy to use and sprays a fine mist. It's lightweight, non-greasy, and there is no residue. It is rated SPF 15, which is fine for me for daily use. I keep it on the counter by the back door so I remember to use sun protection when I am gardening or working in the backyard.

I wanted something like this for when I am trying to tan naturally from the sun, without risking full exposure to the sun's UV rays. It does seem to work, obviously, you won't tan as quickly as if you had no protection though. But on the bright side, you also are less likely to burn if you are out in it for 1+ hours.

When I ordered this Coppertone Tanning Sunscreen Spray, I thought I was getting a pump bottle. No, it is a pressurized spray bottle, which I try to avoid. Nevertheless, the spray goes on as expected, has a pleasant "sunscreen" scent (is this a thing? "sunscreen scent"?), and soon after application has no residual feel or appearance. As with other clear sunscreens, you have to take it on faith whether your skin is covered adequately.  I do like that this product does not contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are harmful to coral reefs (you can easily find articles on whether your sunscreen's ingredients are harmful to coral reefs). I think the formulation makes this sunscreen legal in Hawaii. In 2018, Hawaii passed the nation’s first law banning the sale of sunscreen products containing oxybenzone and octinoxate. The law went into effect in 2021. So this product is ready for your vacation!

I'm giving this a three because I don't like the smell. Luckily it doesn't linger after 8-10 minutes. It smells kinda good at the very first, like cocoa butter, but that is quickly overwhelmed with the smell of alcohol and chemicals. When it dries, it has a smell that is a bit lemony but not really good. (To me.) It dissipates quickly so 20 minutes later I don't notice it. The smell keeps me from enjoying the product. I do like how invisible it is. It doesn't cause a shine at all. It's only minimally moisturizing to me . It's very easy to put on. It sprays on easily, and the can locks, so you have to twist it for it to spray. The spray comes out far enough for me to easily get it on the back of my legs and shoulders and back. I love that it's invisible and water resistant for 80 minutes.

I can't use this low of an SPF but my wife did on a recent vacation and it was awesome. She got perfectly tan without the burn. It smells good, goes on really evenly, and is a fair value for 3 bottles. The sprayer locks so no worries in your beach bag. Easy recommendation.

Spf 15 meaning you'll be protected from harmful rays, but still get some tan. I love the ease of spray sunblock and the smooth application. Sprays evenly, and doesn't feel tacky or sticky. Has a nice scent. Came in a pack of 3, so enough yo last all summer.

It sprays on easily and is free from Dyes, Oxybenzone, and PABA. we spray it on outside and reapply every hour to keep the protection going. In Florida we need a good sunscreen, While SPF 15 isn't the highest it works good n my darker skin.

SPF 15 is my go to when it comes to a tanning lotion. It blocks a lot of the harmful rays but lets in enough sun to get a healthy looking tan. The locking spray cap is super convenient and perfect for throwing in my beach bag and it eliminates accidental messes. The spray application is non-greasy and easy especially for the kids, it comes out on the heavy side so it covers fast and evenly. The smell is typical for Coppertone, light and nostalgic of my youth. This will be our summer favorite on vacation and on the boat, this three pack is a pretty good option for the price.

Just turn the top and spray makes it easy to get my back area Love the smell. Great for at the beach I always seem to get sand all over my body when using lotions. Highly recommend

I typically use a higher SPF but decided to try this out for a short sun exposure. It was easy to spray, wasn’t super oily, and helped my skin get a little extra tan.

- spray bottle is easy to use , spray and rub easily - comfortable to use , no stickiness - scent is ok - worked well for me

I was a little annoyed when this stuff arrived, because it isn't made clear in the description that this spray comes in a pressurised bottle. I'm currently overseas and I'm having my Amazon products shipped out to me, and shipping pressurised bottles in normal cargo can be problematic. Ended up costing me more than the bottles are worth to ship them as hazardous cargo.  Anyhoo, I love this stuff. It applies evenly and dries very quickly. I can close my eyes, cover my face and wait just a few seconds, and there isn't any residue left over to drip in my eyes. I'll use this stuff all the time at home, but due to the pressurised bottles I don't think I'd want to take it with me on vacation in case I wasn't allowed to fly with it.

I received this item through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.  This is a nice sunscreen.  The set of three is a bit excessive if you're not going to use all of it since it expires in a couple years. The sunscreen its self has a sweet smell and goes on smooth. The spray is easy to use and rubs in well. It's not greasy or sticky. Not sure how much protection against the sun it has, but is an interesting find.

We have a pool and our daughter and her friends are in it constantly. We always need sun protection. Coppertone is a brand our family has trusted for decades. It goes on smoothly with a fine mist, absorbs well, smells good, and works well in sunburn protection. You don't need to much - it goes a long way so we're planning this to last us a while.  We give it five stars and recommend it without hesitation to anyone considering it.

I work outside and use this regularly. Great scent and does not feel greasy. Easy to apply.

What's not to like about Coppertone? I grew up in the 70's when there was very little choices of sunscreens (especially on the East Coast). Every time I smell Coppertone, I am brought back to Myrtle Beach. Good stuff. I'm a lot older, but still buy it. Even though I like the lotions better for coverage, the sprays are a lot more convenient to use. They're faster and dry quick. The smell is vintage Coppertone - very familiar to any Gen-Xer. With 15 spf, I wouldn't use this for a day a the beach, but mowing or a long walk on a sunny day. Overall, I am happy with and am looking forward to using them more in the summer.

Coppertone Tanning Sunscreens spray on easily and consistently. The sunscreen is lightweight, dries quickly, and doesn't leave an oily film behind. The only complaint is that it has a very strong alcohol smell when first sprayed however that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving behind a beachy scent that lasts.

This light sun screen feels good on the skin, doesn’t feel sticky, SPF 15 will lightly protect your skin and still be able to get tanned quicker, good product.

The best sun protection products come from Coppertone and this one is no exception - in my opinion!
