Blends in flawlessly, perfect base for make up and protects well! This is a very very good product. It’s expensive, yes, but it spreads really well on the face and I don’t use that much. It has protected me very well. I can easily put foundation on top and it works well. The white color almost right away blends into the skin. Just great.

The sunscreen is perfect for my finicky face. It goes on light and wears well.

This product is great for sun protection, but am I the only one who doesn’t have issues with this sunscreen flaking off when rubbing it in gently? I thought it was my moisturizer so I switched brands but it still flaked and made my skin hell when applied. I have to rewash my face and just skip sunscreen since it flakes up so bad, I may just have bad luck :/ I’m gonna go back to my supergoop unseen

I've been using this for several years, moisturizing, non greasy and doesn't clog pores.

I love this product because it doesn’t cause my skin to breakout. It doesn’t burn your eyes like most sunscreen. It’s light weight with great protection and keeps my skin moisturized.

Sun protection and more. I use everyday every morning even winter time I wear. Sine I use this product my skin look very health, don’t need under face make up like foundation or bb cream. Love this creamy texture! You just need take time to massage in to your skin.

This was recommended by an esthetician. I love the non greasy and light weight feel of it. Smells great too!

I like it

I usually hate sunscreen as it’s normally heavy too strong smelling and sticky/ thick. This goes on smooth and doesn’t smell strong and doesn’t let make up look bad.

This product is the best I’ve ever used on my face. Very light and doesn’t clog your pores.
