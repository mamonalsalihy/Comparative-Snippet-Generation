Great quality at a very good price. I use this every day before outdoor walks.

I like that this is environmentally friendly. Since I snorkle alot I feel better knowing not so harsh chemicals are coming off me in the water. I did not burn in the Panama City Florida sunshine all week. The only improvement I would suggest is to make the trigger lock a little less complicated to figure out.

My family is skin sensitive to a lot of sunscreen products . Rickey Mountain protects and is sensitive to skin. Great product
