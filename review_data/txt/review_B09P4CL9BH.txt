I believe this is a pretty good sunscreen and I use it daily on my dome and other body parts when I‚Äôll be in the sun for more than 15 minutes. I like the scent and the quick absorption. It seems to hold up well to sweat and salt water.

My husband loves this brand- does not get into your eyes if you perspire.

I have been using this sunscreen for a long time. SPF 30 works better on my skin that higher SPFs

This seems to be a pretty traditional chemical based sunscreen. We found those goes on fairly easily and protects well even with a bit of sweating going on. Vintage coppertone brand performance and very mild scent. A good value as long as your skin isn't sensitive to these kinds of formulations.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion, Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Multi Pack, 7 Fl Oz  One of my favorite sunblocks because it has broad spectrum, water and sweat resistant SPF 30 and doesn't break me out. Won't run into your eyes during workouts either!

With a family of 4, you can never have too many extra sunscreen containers. Some in the camper, some in the house, some in the kids backpacks for summer camp, some at the grandparents. We've used coppertone for years and have fallen back on them over other brands. This sunscreen does a great job at protecting against sunburn and doesn't feel greasy.

This has a great texture that applies easily to the skin without being too thick or runny. When I applied it, it was easy to notice that it didn't leave any kind of oily fealing afterwards. It has a nice fragrance that isn't overpowering and doesn't stand out too much.  Despite sweating while doing work outside, I have happily avoided sunburn so far on my usually sensitive skin. I made sure to follow its reapplication instruction after a certain amount of time and had no issues.  Overall this is certainly a recommend as one has no problems so far with it.
