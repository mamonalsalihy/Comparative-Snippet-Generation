My husband loves this brand- does not get into your eyes if you perspire.

This sunscreen works well and it's priced favorably.

Great sunscreen for the money

I believe this is a pretty good sunscreen and I use it daily on my dome and other body parts when I’ll be in the sun for more than 15 minutes. I like the scent and the quick absorption. It seems to hold up well to sweat and salt water.

I have been using this sunscreen for a long time. SPF 30 works better on my skin that higher SPFs

When it comes to sunscreen for my family, I don't mess around. I stick to two well known brands. Coppertone being my top brand. I was excited to try this out.  What this is: I received a 2 pack of Coppertone Sport Broad spectrum SPF 30. 7 fluid ounces each. We choose sport 30 because when we wear sunscreen it is usually at the beach which consist of going into the ocean. We learned early on other brands do not stand up so well in the ocean.  What I like about this: Sunscreens are changing. Getting rid of the bad stuff. This one is free from dyes, PABA, Octinoxate and Oxybenzone.  What it still has is the Coppertone scent that for my entire lifetime I have mentally linked with Coppertone and summer.  To try it: I am not at the beach any time soon. I did wear this out while gardening. I feel it did the job, but I was only out for about an hour also. It is Coppertone though, I trust it.  To put it on: It is a light formula. Absorbs very well. It absorbs much better than other sunscreen lotions. It didn't leave my skin with a coat of white lotion. It is not greasy.  It is still recommended that it is reapplied every 80 minutes. It is sweat, heat and water resistant. It does stop 97% UV rays.

The Coppertone two pack is conveniently designed to easily fit into an 'on the go bag'. SPF 30 is right where I need to be, you may vary depending on outdoor activities.  I have now used the sunscreen on two occasions (we are just coming into spring) while out in the yard for a few hours at a time in the sun.  Best advice, is read the instructions for application frequency. I found it easy to apply, with no strong smell or oily feel left behind.  Coppertone is a name that my family has trusted for generations and with comfortable and effective products like this sunscreen they will continue to be in our family.  Over the span of my two non consecutive days of wearing the Coppertone broad spectrum SPF30 sunscreen out in the sun, I can say that not only did I not burn but the sunscreen held up well against my sweat; keeping the coverage in tact.

This is a nice medium-weight suntan lotion that feels moisturizing. I love the fragrance. Per the bottle, it is free of oxybenzone, octinoxate, dyes, phthalates, and PABA. It is water resistant up to 80 minutes but I did not test that claim. It also provides broad spectrum SPF 30 protection and supposedly stops up to 97% of the UV rays.  I tried theirlightweight lotion , and really liked it but I love this one because it is a thicker cream and has a stronger scent.  I am not one that likes to be in the sun but I have a convertible. Therefore, I am always slathering on suntan lotion for protection, including this one. The current price of $11.88 ($13.98 minus 15%) comes to a reasonable $6 per 7-ounce bottle.

I was the person that never wore sunscreen growing up and paying the price now. I wouldn’t think of going out in the sun today without protection and SPF 30 is what I start my summers with. I’m all for getting a healthy tan but I like to get it slower than I used to. I think this twin pack is a pretty good value for what I consider a pretty good product. Sweat, heat and water resistant for me and my kids but I’ll still need to apply it often. The squeeze containers are easy to use and seal tight so they don’t make a mess in my beach bag. With spring break a week away this will be our go to when we’re hanging at the beach.

I remember when Coppertone first came out with their sport line up. I tried it and it instantly became my favorite line up. This is true especially on and around my face. This doesn't come off when sweating and go into your eyes. I think the older I get, 30 SPF is the best too - not too thick but does offer enough protection. The scent is vintage Coppertone Sport and I love it. It reminds of growing up when the little brown bottles was the only sunscreen available almost. Overall, I am a big fan of Coppertone Sport 30 SPF.

I use this Coppertone sunscreen before my daily runs and it has worked perfectly for me so far. It applies easily and dries quickly while also holding up well against sweat. It does not irritate my skin and doesn’t feel sticky. It doesn't have an overwelling sunscreen smell so I feel comfortable wearing it without having something else to cover the scent. The cap closes securely so I dont have sunscreen running everywhere after using it. Overall works great at a reasonable price so I have to reccomend it.

I have been a longtime user of Coppertone products, as a pale skinned redhead. This sport version is supposedly longer lasting than some other types. I still reapply every 60-80 minutes. This product is as described. My only caution with this is not to use it on your face if you sweat heavily-you do not want this to get into your eyes under any circumstances. While not unique to this brand-this seems especially difficult to remove once it's hit the eye ball. Will order again without a doubt.

I have always been a fan of Coppertone Sport Sunscreen. This formulation doesn't disappoint. It goes on smoothly, and my skin doesn't feel greasy just seconds after application. And here is the bonus. Hawaii has banned the use of certain active ingredients in sunscreens because it is harmful to coral reefs. This product is legal in Hawaii!

Coppertone sunscreen is a good, reliable sun protection product. This sports version is no exception. It has a good, creamy consistency that absorbs well. It has the light smell that I associate with most sunscreens. It provides a reasonable amount of protection while you're active outside. This is a set of 2 bottles of sunscreen.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Lotion, Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Multi Pack, 7 Fl Oz  One of my favorite sunblocks because it has broad spectrum, water and sweat resistant SPF 30 and doesn't break me out. Won't run into your eyes during workouts either!

This 30 rated lotion is good for those with medium skin tones. If you're very lite try the 50 version. Has a mild pleasant scent. It's not waterproof but none of them are no matter what they claim. The best for watersports is the oil versions.

I live in Florida and sunscreen is important year round, this works great on body and face. I use it every day and it rubs in quickly and doesn't leave a strong scent or oily feel. Price s good for quality

With a history of melanoma, I have high expectations of sunscreen and this one hits the mark. Nice and thick, easy to rub in, smells nice, and doesn't leave me greasy or oily. Perfect for everyday use!

This has a great texture that applies easily to the skin without being too thick or runny. When I applied it, it was easy to notice that it didn't leave any kind of oily fealing afterwards. It has a nice fragrance that isn't overpowering and doesn't stand out too much.  Despite sweating while doing work outside, I have happily avoided sunburn so far on my usually sensitive skin. I made sure to follow its reapplication instruction after a certain amount of time and had no issues.  Overall this is certainly a recommend as one has no problems so far with it.

The media could not be loaded. As sun screen note that it doesn't offer nearly as much protection as higher SPF options ... but for me this is a 5-star lotion because of trade offs: it goes on very smooth and easy, soaking in and FEELING like you don't have sunscreen on.  So not a thick, goopy block out.  So there is less protection but more comfort, and for me that means I'm more likely to use it. Not perfect but pretty good.  My video shows how it goes on easy and clear.

This sunscreen works well but sadly it gave one of my kids a rash. It does well with sun protection. None of us burned while using this. It smells like typical sunscreen does but it isnt terribly sticky/oily. I really like the container - it makes application a little easier. The size is also nice - not too large so it isnt terribly heavy in my bag but it isnt tiny either. I'm bummed that it didnt work for all of us.

Spring has sprung and the UV index is on the rise. Time for sunscreen!  I've trusted the Coppertone brand for decades and this SPF 30 lotion is no disappointment. It goes on easily, doesn't have a strong odor and, most importantly, does a good job blocking the sun's damaging UV light. The product stays on pretty well when sweating too.  The two pack is a good value. Recommended!

Coppertone is a brand that I can trust, and that I have trusted for many years for skin protection. This is a 2 pack of the Coppertone Sport 4 in 1 performance sunscreens. It smells great and applies and absorbs nicely to your skin. This sunscreen is water resistant for up to 80 minutes, and also resists sweat and heat. It works well on sensitive skin as well. Highly recommend.

Sunscreen is a must for us (history of skin cancers all around.) This is my hubby’s favorite sunscreen. It’s got a nice scent that is not overpowering and it does on well without being greasy. This is the best sunscreen we’ve found to help resist sweat if you sweat a lot (making it a true “sport” sunscreen. Glad this comes in a 2 pack so we have plenty on hand.

With a family of 4, you can never have too many extra sunscreen containers. Some in the camper, some in the house, some in the kids backpacks for summer camp, some at the grandparents. We've used coppertone for years and have fallen back on them over other brands. This sunscreen does a great job at protecting against sunburn and doesn't feel greasy.

This sunscreen lotion is what you would expect from a market leader like Coppertone. We're starting to get spring-like days, so I've been working outdoor when I can. I've used this several days where I worked outside all day, and with the application of this sunscreen, my sun ray exposure was minimized. I've learned through hard-learned lessons that you can suffer the effects of sun radiation no matter the time of year, so I usually wear sunscreen any time I'm outside. This lotion worked as expected. No complaints.

This seems to be a pretty traditional chemical based sunscreen. We found those goes on fairly easily and protects well even with a bit of sweating going on. Vintage coppertone brand performance and very mild scent. A good value as long as your skin isn't sensitive to these kinds of formulations.

These are very good. We always like Coppertone. The "standup" form is very good -- we can stand them up on the pool ground or table and not make a mess. These are on the small size, again make it easy to throw in our pool/beach bag. Recommended.

As I get older I realize the importance of sunscreen. I was completely out so this two pack has restocked my supply as we head into summer. I like the smell and this is a brand I trust. It isn't greasy and doesn't irritate my skin.

This has always been my go to sunblock when I'm doing anything active, especially when I go swimming. You definitely need to make sure you reapply after swimming though to make sure you're protected

The best sun protection products come from Coppertone and this one is no exception - in my opinion!

It works well! Smells great. Waterproof…. Don’t forget to re apply🤓…. Enjoy fun in the sun with no worries✌️
