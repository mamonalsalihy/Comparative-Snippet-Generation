I hate sunscreen and lotion, but both are a necessity for me. I have very fair and somewhat sensitive skin. A dermatologist recommended this to me for every day use.  It doesn't leave you stuck with greasy hands. All the greasiness just rubs in like with a good lotion. It also seems effective. I've spent a lot of time in the sun and on the water wearing this stuff, and as long as I re-apply every hour or so if I'm in direct sunlight, I won't get burned.  Despite the lack of greasiness, it will definitely leave you with a sheen, or white shadows if it's not 100% rubbed in or is overused. It makes my face feel a little sweaty, but they all do.  However, this is one of the few lotions I've tried over the years that won't cause any irritation/breakouts on my face. This weekend I ran out of my Neutrogena and tried a big-store brand, and I woke up the next day breaking out with acne; my first breakout in probably 2 years.  All this said, especially if you have sensitive skin, ALWAYS SPOT TEST new (to you) products.

When I buy cosmetics online, I am always wary about the fact that I cannot see the expiration date on these products. When I got the product, I immediately looked at the expiration date and I still had about a year and a half from today, which was great to find. Even at walmart, it's hard to find products that are newly made and packaged with a long expiration date. For the product itself, I have been using it for the last five years and it is my holy-grail. At this price point, you cant find anything better than this. No white cast, good for oily skin (doesn't make it more oily), lightweight. If you put on ALOT of foundation or makeup, go for a more liquidous sunscreen. The texture of this sunscreen is like a cream so sometimes it can be harder to deal with when you put on a lot of makeup.

Before this, I was using Dermatology sunscreen (who also sells other high priced skin care products). I ran out and needed some more sunscreen for my face fast, so I placed an order for this. It feels and works just like the name brand but at a fraction on the cost. I will be using Neutrogena for my sunscreen needs from here on out.

I have very sensitive skin and hate the feeling of sunscreen. This is the only sunscreen that doesn’t bother me, and works really well. I must use it because I’m a melanoma survivor for the past 23 years, and I must wear sunscreen. I don’t go out in the sun much but when I do, this is what I use. I’ve used it for many years. Now that my family has tried it, this is all they will use because it isn’t greasy or sticky. This 4 pack is a great deal!

This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever tried and I have been using this for 5 years after experimenting with other products for 10 years. It is easy to spread and will quickly absorbed through the skin so you will forget that you had sunscreen! It does its job so I can see the difference between my face (where I use the product) and my arms (where I do not use this often). I recommend to apply ample amount of this for full protection and even onto your neck and arms if you are gonna have prolonged exposure to sun. Highly recommended!!

no sunscreen smell, perfect under makeup as my dermatologist recommended after a few basal cell carcinomas...use it!

eos-eos

Easy on sensitive skin and does what it's supposed to do, which is protect your skin from the sun. Most importantly, it does not carry a heavy smell. Reapply every 3-4 hour with light sweat to no sweat, and every 2 hour with waterfall sweat. It's kept me away from those skin burning red sunburns so far.  If you apply it over your face, be sure to not get any into your eyes after sweating, because it stings pretty bad and will need water to wash your eyeballs.

I think I have tried every sunscreen product on the market, from high end department stores to dermatologist office products and Med-Spa products to drugstore and grocery store brands. I have felt way too greasy, way too cakey with white zinc, and developed clogged facial pores and those uncomfortable under-the-skin blemishes with basically every product. This has remained true no matter how many years go by. This Neutrogena UltraSheer is one of only a couple that I have ever bought more than once; in fact, we have bought numerous tubes of this product. We have used it in a variety of climates.

eos-eos

I worked outside in 83 degree heat for 8 hours yesterday wearing this product. As someone with sensitive skin, a family history of skin cancer, and skin that is both acne-prone/oily and too dry, it's hard to find something that works for me. This works. The only thing I would note is there is a slight scent.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen. I have very pale skin with some acne, so I wear this every day under my makeup to prevent hyperpigmentation and protect myself from the sun. It does have the sunscreen smell, but once applied it fades within a couple of minutes. I can apply my foundation instantly after I've rubbed this into my skin with no issues. The only complaint I have is that occasionally it will sting my eyes a bit if my eyes get watery, but this is pretty minor and my skin is REALLY really sensitive (so it might not be an issue for you). This does not cause me to have more breakouts, which is something that was really important to me.

eos-eos

I buy Neutrogena sunscreen because it is one of the few lotions/sunscreens that works well with my sensitive skin. It feels like a dryer, thicker version of moisturiser (not a bad thing, just can't think of a better description!). There is no scent that I can perceive. The sunscreen itself is not greasy and rubs into skin smoothly and easily with little to no wait time for it to settle into your skin. I can apply makeup or hop in a pool pretty quickly after applying. It does not leave behind a white residue on your skin, although I have gotten a white residue on clothing before if I dressed too quickly after applying (waiting 5 minutes means no problem!). It has never stained my clothes, however, and wipes off easily with my daughter's sensitive baby wipes.

eos-eos

I’ve used this for several years now. I bought it because of the typical greasy, smelly sunscreens that also stains clothes. Doesn’t smell, non greasy, rubs in almost like lotion, and doesn’t stain. And then, it does its job as a very effective sunscreen. Having had skin cancer, it’s the only sunscreen I use now.

I have been buying this exact sunblock for at least 5 years now. I have even purchased the SPF 110 for my boyfriend who was much lighter than I am. Anyway, this stuff works great. I have worn it in such places as Aruba, and Guadeloupe where the sun is super strong. Every time i have worn it as the directions say, I have been fine. No sunburn. It goes on nicely. It is not super thick and for a week trip 2 bottles will last you.

I came to Neutrogena Ultra Sheer from Cerave sunscreen because the Cerave products were too thick and would clump up on my skin or leave streak marks. With this product, I just dot some around my face and neck, then spread around. There is a temporary white cast that helps me see where I've applied, and it disappears within minutes. No grease and no shine. Application is easier right after cleansing when the face is still wet.  A two-pack has lasted me over a year--well worth the money!

I spend a lot of time on mountain streams fly fishing, which exposes me to a lot of direct and reflected sunlight. This is the best sunscreen I've found. It doesn't take a lot to cover your exposed area, it protects as expected, it leaves no greasy residue, and it doesn't wash off if you emerge a hand or arm into the water.

Used on our trip to Greece. We never got any sunburn, though outside in the sun at ancient ruins or playing on the beach.  I like the texture of the lotion and the lack of greasy residue once applied.

Don’t know about you, but I have a hard time finding the travel size at my local store. Great to find these on Amazon. No problems going through airport security with these in my rollaboard.

I spend a lot of time outdoors. I am a triathlete and boater. I have tried numerous types of sunscreen. There were many things that prompted me to purchase this sunscreen. First, is that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen (protects against both uva and uvb rays). Second, is the endorsement from dermatologist. Third, is the promise of a light, non greasy application. This sunscreen truly delivers on all fronts. While wearing this as directed on a cruise, I was never once burnt despite being out in the sun for hours. I was especially impressed that once I applied the sunscreen I could not tell I had it on. Most sunscreens leave a sticky, greasy feeling. This simply felt like a light moisturizer. It's a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, worth every penny.

eos-eos

Me encantó!! No es muy pegajoso y se seca bien. Es fácil de esparcir porque no sé queda blanco en la piel (si no que transparenta como una crema hidratante común). Es bastante hidratante, deja un Glow en mi piel muy lindo, casi no huele a nada, lo que se aprecia. El tamaño es bastante considerable (pensé que sería más pequeño) así que por ese precio 2 es una ganga de un muy buen producto. Lo recomiendo bastante.

I know this stuff is a little expensive, but it's a great product. I put a good amount of lotion on right before I run. I run in the middle of the day, sometimes for up to an hour. I can't reapply in the middle of my run because I don't carry the bottle with me. Under these conditions, I have not gotten sunburned even once, not even mildly, since I started using this lotion. So it works. It's not greasy, it doesn't smell bad, it doesn't make you feel like you dipped your head in Crisco. It's just a really great sunblock.

Very good for sensitive skin

I shave my head and I usually dread sunblock because you can see my shinny head from a block away. I was headed to Cancun for vacation so I knew I definitely needed sunblock. While searching for oil free sunblock I picked this up as one option because I was skeptical about sheer sunblock. It worked great. Has a very slight sheen, and doesn't feel like it makes dirt stick to you.

I was able to buy (2) tubes of this gentle sunscreen packaged together. Each having a broad spectrum SPF of 45, dry to the touch giving my skin a clean feel. I have used Neutrogena products in the past and have been very pleased. I plan on using this product everyday on my face keeping my skin soft and supple. The tubes state that the sunscreen is water resistant for up to 80 minutes. I am very pleased with my purchase and I will definitely buy from this seller again.

Everyone needs to wear a sunscreen. These are wonderful because they dry clear, have little to no fragrance, and dry matte. I don’t like sunscreens that leave you with a greasy white cast and these are the perfect sunscreens. They aren’t too big, which is nice because you can fit them in your bag or backpack and reapply when needed. The SPF is high as well. I wore this sunscreen to the beach and reapplied every hour and did not burn (I usually burn). I recommend this sunscreen to everyone.

Applied this everyday before I got dressed on a recent 5-day trip to Mexico, including on my face prior to makeup application. Truly a lightweight but effective sunscreen - there were only 2 days I was in the sun enough to reapply but I only did so once or twice. No burns all week and none of that 'greasy' feeling sunscreen can leave you with. This is the new sunscreen I will swear by!

eos-eos

I bought this after reading some reviews and have been very happy with this purchase. I was used to two types of sunscreen, the lotion style and the spray on. Both, although working, always made me feel gross and greasy throughout the day. This lotion was the exact opposite. You put it on and it doesn't even seem like it's there. I've used it a number of times this summer for outdoor activities like hiking and bicycling and didn't get burned one bit.I highly recommend this if you want to protect your skin and not feel gross and greasy all day.

After having 2 Moh's surgeries to remove cancer from my face, I make sure to put this on every morning. I like that it is not greasy.

I have been using this for years. I used to use an off brand and would get sunburn. As a redhead, my skin burns easily. I put this on my face everyday it is above 60 degrees and have been putting it on my arms and neck. Just went to the dermatologist and she said, "Your skin looks great!"

I put this on everyday before I apply makeup. My dermatologist said you should always have suntan lotion on your face under your make-up. With having skin cancer ony face this is a daily routine. Love this product as it does not have a smell.

This is the only facial sunscreen that I use on myself and my kids. For myself, I usually do not like using sunscreen on my face because I have sensitive skin and fear that it might cause me to break out or cause some sort of irritation on my face, but this one is great. No irritation and no breakouts and I feel protected from the sun. The sunscreen feels light on my skin and it smells nice. For my kids, it protects their skin from the sun and does not irritate their skin at all. I usually send each of them to school/camp with one tube each.

Absolutely perfect, not oily at all. I have dark skin so I have to rub quite a bit to not have that grayish blur. And yes, dark skin people do need to wear sunscreen. Skin cancer and the sun rapidly aging you does not discriminate 😛

One of the better sun block products I’ve used for several years. SPF 45 is good for me because not as white on skin as SPF 50. My dermatologist approves it because I have sensitive skin.

eos-eos

I wouldn't really call this "dry-touch" but that probably goes for any sunscreen making the same claim. There is a slight bit of a greasy film left on your skin but that's a small price to pay to prevent sunburn. I'm not particularly good a reapplying as often as the instructions say, though my fair skin still does fine after several hours of sweating in the 90+ degree southern heat and repeated dips in and out of the pool.

It’s a little different because it’s not like most sunscreen. Very happy with it. It does seem to take more because it goes on so dry

I'm a big fan of Japanese sunscreens, but it's just not feasible to have japanese sunscreen shipped over in tiny bottles for body use. I'll use this one in a pinc without it feeling tacky or sticky on my face, and have absolutely no qualms about putting it on my arms and legs. It's a great dry sunscreen with full coverage!

It works well for me. I also like the easy on/off lid and its ability to function as a stand for the tube while applying the sunscreen

This, by far is the least "sticky" while also providing me good protection for about 1 to 1.5 hours. Pigment baseline: I am Korean-American. My natural arm pit color is fair to light. I typically burn a nice orange. FYI. I have tried more than SPF 45, and not sure I noticed the difference. I have used over 60 bottles of this Ultra Sheer and I have not died yet or seen any of my moles become red or enlarged. So it seems to be working pretty well for this middle aged Korean. good luck.

As I’ve gotten older I’ve really come to appreciate the importance of wearing a good sunscreen every day of the year, rain or shine. I settled on Neutrogena a few years ago because it works well, my face isn’t left with a greasy feeling, and my makeup goes on smoothly on top of it. Even at 55 I still tend to occasionally break out, so I love that this sunscreen is non-comedogenic (won’t clog my pores). I’ve tried a lot of sunscreens over the years, and Neutrogena has by far been my favorite.

Spreads easily, not greasy, stain is minimal. I have tan skin, but this seems to work all day.

I love this sunscreen. Living in Florida, you use sunscreen almost weekly so this product gets used a lot in my house. Easy to apply, subtle scent, and great sun protection. I love that It came in a bundle which saved me a few trips to the store for more. Highly recommend this and use your HSA for the purchase.

This sunscreen never disappoints. I am a red head with very sensitive skin and have to be careful of what I use for sunscreen. With this product, I can put it on and not worry about any skin reactions or possible sunburns. It is not greasy and has a great scent that is great year-round (I hate smelling like coconuts in December when it is 40 degrees out). I use this all the time and actually get it as part of subscribe and save. No more skin cancer for me with a great product like this!

The sunscreen level of this product is just right. The skin absorbs it without that greasy look or feel. I've used it for years and will not leave my house without putting it on my face, arms and hands. I'm 77 and look like 57. Living in southern California and not using it, I'd look like I was 87.

This sunscreen is so much nicer on your skin than typical sunscreen. It doesn't have a greasy feel what so ever and honestly after I apply I don't even notice I have sunscreen on. There's no potent smell which is nice as well. I try not to use any aerosol products as they are horrible for the earth and although it can be quicker using aerosol I sometimes feel like I may be missing spots and/or half of the spray is just going into the air. I feel better using this product and it's great for sensitive skin.

My favorite sunscreen of all sunscreens! This doesn't feel greasy after application or come with a stinky scent (I think it is a super light fresh scent that vanishes after a few minutes of wearing it) But mostly I like how it rubs in and doesn't feel like a ton of build up on my skin. I will keep buying this. A little on the expensive side, but it feels nice and absorbs quickly. By far the best sunscreen I have tried in a while. A little goes a long way as well, also making it more worth the price.

I've been wearing this as a daily facial sunscreen for the past 2 weeks, and I love it! I'm in my 30's and have really been stepping up my skincare routine, so a higher SPF sunscreen is a must. It applies white and creamy, but quickly blends to a transparent, non-greasy consistency. This feels wonderful and smooth on my skin, almost powdery, the fragrance is light and not overpowering like some sunscreens, and it doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts. I'm 100% sold on this product.

As a red head, I pretty consistently need to apply sunscreen in the summertime. This sunscreen is one of my ultimate favorites for the face, neck, and hairline. When it dries, it's not greasy and has a plesant smell as far as sunscreen can go. Also, it's size is very convenient for a purse for everyday skin protection. Love love love!
