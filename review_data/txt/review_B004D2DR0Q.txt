Several of us used this product for a lake day and we applied several times throughout the day. We all burnt to a crisp. I look like a lobster, the kids are crying, we would not recommend this product. Was the batch bad? Was it a fake product? Left us bright red and patchy. Do not buy unless you’re in the market to be cooked.

Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Water Resistant and Non-Greasy Sunscreen Lotion

It does all it's meant to do, but leaves a white cast all over. Which honestly makes you consider if you want to your skin to look normal and glowy, or to look ghastly while being protected.

One one I use now. Covers easily and not greasy

I really liked this sunscreen at first. The smell is pleasant, it feels light, and it didn’t make me look greasy. With each day of wearing it though within the course of a week, my skin started to feel worse and worse despite not being in the sun. It started as a tingling that I thought was just from being in hot weather, then it went to a warm sensation, and then it burned so badly that I had to wash my face within a few hours of putting it on. Now, hours after washing it off, my cheeks are red, inflamed, and sore to the touch. I haven’t had a reaction to a product like this in decade. I would absolutely not recommend this, especially if you have sensitive skin.

The product gives a white cast that makes you look very ashy. It is not appealing at all.

I like the product, we used it on arms and legs, not use on the face as the smell is weird. A bit sticky but overall, it is good, good for the value! I hope they can change the smell.

The oil is separated from sunscreen and makes it non useable. I put it in fridge, still the same.
