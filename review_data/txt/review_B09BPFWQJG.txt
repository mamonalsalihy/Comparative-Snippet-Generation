The nozzle on the can we received dribbled sunscreen all over the place and only occasionally sprayed as intended. It was extremely runny and on the oily side. I wasn't thrilled to see when someone tried to apply it, it ended up all over my hard wood floors. It smells really nice and seemed to provide nice sun protection but for a spray on sunscreen, it didn't meet expectations for ease of use and application.

I've been searching for a hybrid body sunscreen and since I love my other Seaweed Bath Co sunscreens, I decided to give this a try - so happy I did! I used it when I visited some friends at the beach and it protected my skin all day! I reapplied every couple hours like I do with every sunscreen and didn't have any issues with burning and my skin didn't look ghost-white like with other mineral sunscreens. It goes on easily, you just need to firmly press on the spray and apply in sweeping motions. I love that I get the benefit of both types of sunscreen in one product. My new go-to this summer!

The media could not be loaded. Finally, a hydrating SPF spray. Because it’s richer, and actually moisturizing, it applies best with short but firm presses of the button. A little goes a long way. It also smells so good!

I REALLY love seaweed bath company, and I love this sunscreen: it smells great and goes on smooth, feels like an absorbent lotion rather than a mineral sunscreen. I’m just not sure it lasts very long or is very resistant to sweat and water. I know it says water resistant, but once you hit the water it feels like it’s just gone and we def got crispier than we usually do…also the spray mechanism wasn’t great, it was drippy and leaky. I’m probably Going back to Babu Botanicals for now.

The media could not be loaded. This mineral sunscreen is my new favorite! It’s super light and absorbs very quickly. It applies really well if you shake it first. Also it smells amazing! Thanks Seaweed Bath Co!

Super clean, non-toxic, non-greasy sun protection. Love the way this applies, smells, and feels throughout the day. It’s so clean that I don’t feel grossly covered in chemicals by the end of the day. The peppermint aloe adds a nice cooling effect in the direct sun. As with all spray sunscreens, spray it outside so it doesn’t coat your floors or furniture.
