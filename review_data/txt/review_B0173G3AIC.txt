Goes on looking very oily. Not a good look for your face. I still got brown sun spots (hyperpigmentation) so it didn’t protect well for faces. Would be fine on legs etc - just not for someone’s face with malasma.

Okay price. Wish there was more of it. $7.99 for 3oz, 2.66 an ounce, yikes. Should of read reviews and saw it's 5 inches in height. One review had a ruler measurement. Works good though.

If use as directed you can stay in sun for hours and not burn.

I am pale and burn easy and the 100 is perfect!

For the amount of spf it’s great but it leaves a white cast which is soooooo annoying it’s so hard to find something proper for people with darker skin tones

It is what it says it is, but pay attention to the size in ounces. The picture makes it look bigger than the 3oz it really is.

Seemed a little small for the price

I use this anytime I go for a run on my face and arms. Relative to a similar bananna boat product, this one dries without leaving a cast (non-zinc/titanium based). Really love this! Must have bought 3-4 bottles by now.
