I am extremely pale because of my Irish heritage. I recently went on a trip to Punta Cana and knew I wasn’t about to let me being burned the whole trip stop me from having a blast, so I bought this stuff. It worked like a charm. Mind you, I did rotate myself from shade to exposure and reapplied . Didn’t even look like I went on vacation when I got back ! But you know what? I was the only one not cringing during the massage !

I live in Lima Peru where the ozone hole is so large, our UV radiation levels are almost maxed out. I have a sleeve tattoo and I use this everytime I go out and I have no issues with sun burn, sensitive skin (ink makes your skin sensitive), and no issues with fading in my ink. It doesn't rub off while climbing or working out and it stays put through sweat and water. 100 may be overkill but I don't want anything less for my sleeve.

AFTER GETTING A SECOND DEGREE BURN FROM A SUNBURN, I UPGRADED TO 100 SPF AND IT WORKED BETTER THAN THE 50 SPF. NO SUNBURN!

I have very fair skin, so it was a bit heavy for me personally, but if I were to go swimming or shirtless or something, it would be perfect on my back.

My only complaint is that the container is rather small. Still works well for me since I have a light sensitivity caused by baby aspirin blood thinner and get purple blotches on my arms. Haven’t noticed any while using this. Tip: always use it 15 minutes before exposure and reapply every 80 to 90 minutes.

I am very fair skinned.....needed good coverage! This did the trick!

I was on medication that made me particularly sensitive to the hot sun. I also, have 5 grand-kids playing baseball, so lots of time in the sun. This product worked beautifully with no sunburn.

Seemed a little small for the price

If use as directed you can stay in sun for hours and not burn.

Perfect size to keep in your bag

I use this anytime I go for a run on my face and arms. Relative to a similar bananna boat product, this one dries without leaving a cast (non-zinc/titanium based). Really love this! Must have bought 3-4 bottles by now.

Excelente

It’s super tiny which I did not read but it’s ok. It does the trick

Made it through security & customs in my carryon baggage. It’s very thick since it’s 100 spf but for pale people like me, it’s necessary :)

Really good price for excellent quality product

Great product just a little pricey for the amount you receive.

Smaller bottle fit well in our luggage. Works well to protect from the sun. Just don't forget to reapply!

I'm a physician and the conventional wisdom is that spf over 50 is useless. I can confirm that isn't true. I am very fair, red haired. We live in sunny Colorado and travel to Hawaii a lot. I have NEVER gotten burned with this. Even with reapplication anything less than 70 will cause me to burn. This gives me more confidence in the sun and stays on well even in salt water. At first I was upset that they changed the packaging and went to a smaller amount. However this size is much more convenient to put in a purse or bag. With the grooved edges it's also easier to hold when you have slippery sunscreen fingers.

Great product trustworthy

Awesome coverage for my outdoor sports days

Helped even out my tan.

Because I have rosacea, I have to have sun protection on my face. Not only does the 100 work, it also doesn’t cause a rash like other brands.

eos-eos

Works great for me, I will put it on mid day and spend hours out in the sun and never get burned. Has a strong smell, but I can deal with it.

I love this sun screen and won't purchase any other kind!

The 1st time in my life that I did not get burnt.

I burn very easily. This is the one sunscreen I can use and honestly spend some time in the pool or ocean and not burn. This small travel size is perfect for your 311 carry on items

Excellent sunscreen. Dries quickly.

I just came back from a vacation to Cancun and this sunscreen was airplane size appropriate. The product covered me from head to toe and gave me all day coverage. I have medium brown skin & I was not sun burnt once!

I'm super pale and a high risk for skin cancer, it runs in my family. I use a lot of sunscreen in the sunnier season and this sunscreen is fantastic! I just wish it wasn't so expensive. The 3 oz bottle is small and it's over 8 dollars even as an "add on" prime item. It's one of the few sunscreens that doesn't melt down into my eyes and sting. This sunscreen has a pleasant light scent too. I just wish I can get a gallon at a time at a cheaper price.
