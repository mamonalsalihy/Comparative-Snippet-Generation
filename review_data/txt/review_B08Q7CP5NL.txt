I’ve been using this product for a few weeks after finishing my Black Girl Sunscreen Kids SPF50 and it’s amazing! I would say they’re both extremely comparable.  CONSISTENCY: The Bondi Sands sunscreen came in great condition and very quickly. Coming out of the tube it’s a white fluid lotion consistency, but it rubs in completely clear.  HOW IT FEELS ON THE FACE: It’s super lightweight and leaves your skin with a glow just like the Black Girl Sunscreen, however it’s ever so slightly stickier when it dries down. (It’s not something you’d notice unless you used BGS one day and then Bondi another)  SMELL: The smell isn’t too bad either, for a fragrance free sunscreen. It smells somewhat like a brand new pool floaty (that kind of plastic smell) but it’s not something that will have you self-conscious about your smell for the rest of the day. It’s much better than that metallic smell most chemical unfragranced sunscreens carry. I honestly forget about the smell when I wear it.  Other sunscreens that don’t have much of a smell include: Eucerin SPF30 Body Cream (8oz), and Black Girl Sunscreen Kids SPF50 (3oz). Both of which I’ve used and thoroughly recommend.  HOW IT FEELS AROUND THE EYES: Unlike the Eucerin Sunscreen, (which isn’t water resistant and runs into the eyes, causing them to water up) this sunscreen is water resistant and doesn’t run into your eyes as much. Even when it does, it’s not nearly as painful or inconvenient. I love using this sunscreen before doing any athletic activity because it’s so robust. The BGS Kids SPF50 was the best in this category, NEVER causing any kind of irritation or watering of the eyes when it ever did run in during exercise.  CONCLUSION: I love this sunscreen and it’s at such a great value I think I’m going to stick with it for a while. The smell is faint and more than tolerable, and it feels great on the skin. I also haven’t burned using this sunscreen and being out in the sun several hours a day doing my sport. Overall, I rate this a 5/5 just like the Black Girl Sunscreen Kids SPF50.

Dr dray put everyone on this spf and it becomes my obsession.The best sunscreeen ever, it doesn’t burn your eyes or leave any white cast, the best for dark skin as myself And very moisturizing which I needed . Amazon didn’t have it No more I literally ordered it At the company itself in order to have it . That’s one of the only sunscreen that does not burn my eyes , specially when am working out at the gym and sweating .

I've been searching for years for a decent chemical sunscreen that's easily accessible, doesn't have fragrance, and that doesn't irritate my skin and eyes. I eventually had to start using Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel since it was the only sunscreen I could find that did almost everything I needed it to do. It's a good sunscreen, but it's a bit pricey and can be hard to get since it's made in Japan. I also found that it was a little drying in the winter and would sometimes be very pilly. I came across this Bondi Sands sunscreen and put it on my list of products to try out. I finally decided to give it a try and I'm so glad that I did. It might not be as cosmetically elegant as most Asian sunscreens, but it still dried down to a nice dewy finish. It doesn't sting my face or eyes. No overpowering smell. Goes on nice and smooth without having to be rubbed in for a long period of time. I don't wear makeup on a regular basis but I can tell that it would work wonderfully under foundation. No pilling. Nice and moisturizing. And all for a price that doesn't break the bank. I hope this product is never reformulated or discountinued because it's the only sunscreen sold in the US that actually works for my dry skin. However, if you have oily or even combo skin you probably won't like this product since it can come across as oily on those types of skin. But it's now a holy grail product for me and my extremely dry skin.

I like it a lot. Everything I wrote for the FACE one, I would write it too for the BODY : moisturizing, no fragrance, no white cast, applies easily, dries withing 10 min, leaves a nice glow.... I wonder if there is a difference in the formula in between the two. Last month, while I was waiting for my re-order of the Face one, I used this BODY sunscreen on my face for about a week. I have not noticed a difference between the BODY and the FACE creams. It did not sting my eyes. I rarely stay in the sun for long, so I don't have a strong review about the sun protection. The only thing I can say is I am very sensitive, and I have not burnt and got red at all. In conclusion, excellent product in my opinion.

eos-eos

Pros: does it’s job, protects from the sun (with proper application) easy to spread, dries super quick, doesn’t leave residue, no added fragrance, doesn’t irritate sensitive areas. Reef safe. Actually does moisturize skin.  Cons: it does a *slight* scent, not an added fragrance (see pros above) but it’s merely naturally occurring smell of the product. It’s very mild and dissipates quickly and is actually rather pleasant so only half a ‘con’ maybe? Otherwise I can’t really think of anything bad to say about it. I think I have finally found my favorite sunscreen.

And I’m taking about ladies that look dead in that cast, this doesn’t cast. PROMISE! I buy a lot of sunscreen, it’s my second favorite for wear and first place for protection and budget friendly. It can get into the eyes and is uncomfortable but doesn’t burn so to speak. I usually put very little around the eyes and wear proper sunshades. My other fav is a Japanese p+++ mermaid sunscreen. It’s small and expensive and has been proven to not provide as much protection as thought previously. It however wears like water. This one, bit oily just a bit. But I’m guaranteed protection and the cost for the size bottle is a bargain. It’s used as my daily face protection. I’m pale mixed with peach undertones, y’all cast is a restart, headed to the shower for me. This looks like moisturizer.

I am big on SPF as a natural born redhead with extremely pale skin. I prefer no color from the sun on my skin. There is sunscreen all over my home and in my car. It is applied and reapplied all day long from the moment I get ready in the morning until dark. This is a really good brand and I’ve had really good luck with it. It goes on Easily and spreads just like moisturizer. It doesn’t leave any white film on my skin and it doesn’t feel tacky after you apply it.

I have really sensitive skin and my whole life I've had severe allergic reactions to sunscreen even the ones for little kids, my point is I know what I’m talking about when it comes to sunscreen because I’ve tried so many looking for one that doesn’t give me rashes and hives and THIS SUNSCREEN omg life changing. It doesn’t have a strong smell or white cast and it doesn’t make my skin even the slightest bit irritated. It’s so good trust me you need this

This sunscreen is Amazing…I absolutely am a happy customer…I have a deep skin tone and this works amazingly…I am also very sensitive and have no issues at all!!! Thank you for a phenomenal product at an even more phenomenal price!!!

It doesn’t leave a white caste, it actually is moisturising as it says and it’s pretty big too. You don’t have to rub in for too long and it’s blended in. I only use on my body as I have a different sunscreen for my face. My body skin type is normal-dry so this was great to moisturise my body while wearing sunscreen. It’d be even better in colder weather. I highly recommend!

eos-eos

I would give this 5 stars, but it burned my face and made it red. When I first applied this it blended in. No white cast and it made my skin glow. Very hydrating. I have darker skin and was excited about no white cast and helping my skin look hydrated. 4 stars because of the reaction, but if I didn’t have a reaction it would be 5. My body has been reacting to all different products though. Definitely try this though and I’m pretty sure you will like it especially if you have dry and darker skin.

Most sunscreens have so much perfume that even after a shower I smell like a cheap perfume factory. Seriously, if I want scent, I'll use cologne. The Australians know how to make sunscreen. Great product. Applies easily. Seems to prevent burning. Applies as a fairly thin lotion, applies easily & smoothly.

eos-eos

I was genuinely surprised by this product. For being mineral, it spreads so well, doesn't leave a white cast and is moisturizing but not greasy. It feels just like a great body lotion. I wore it all weekend in Miami after a long winter with no sun and didn't get a bit of burn. Price is also great. I'm going to buy it in SPF 30 as well for the upcoming summer!

I hate sunscreen, but this stuff is great. My kid bought it first and I was sold the first time I tried it. Doesn’t make me look like a ghost and actually feels nice on my face. I don’t know if it’s perfect for every skin type, but it’s fantastic on my middle-aged skin, as well as my daughter’s breakout-prone skin.

this was recommended by a dermatologist on You Tube. Love that it's 50 spf, moisturizing and it goes on easily with no white cast. also, no fragrance. Nice.

I have very sensitive skin, and most chemical sunscreens burns my skin, but this sunscreen is phenomenal. No reactions and works great, lasts a long time!

Wore one coat all day and didn’t get burnt. 90 degree weather and UV index of 9. Really like how it doesn’t have a powerful scent and doesn’t leave a white coating.

It’s worth the extra money for those with sensitive skin, I only use it on my face and it’s one of the only sunscreens that doesn’t burn my eyes or make my face red

Love this Sunscreen. No white cast, very moisturizing but not greasy

Sunscreen for my face and neck.

I can't say enough good things about this brand. I am a fan of fragrance free and this delivers in spades. Easy to apply, fast absorbing & not greasy.

I’m really dark, so very particular about white cast. This sinks in and has a nice finish, not matte for those looking for such finish

I like the texture. Very easy to spread and absorb in my skin

Very moisturizing , no scent whatsoever and great value for the price. Will definitely be repurchasing

i probably wouldn’t recommend for oily skin but my dry skin loves it, super easy to blend and no white cast. has potential to burn ur eyes if you’re not careful though

This is the best no white cast sunscreen! Have tried serval other sunscreen but this one is the best. It does leave shininess in the face but I can manage .

eos-eos

This is a great sunscreen that does not leave a sticky residue & leaves my skin feeling nice. I do have sensitive skin so it being scent free is great. I apply it over my normal moisturizer & it still drys down fine

Love it! Perfect for sensitive skin. Feel like you wearing nothing.

Thank you Dr Dray for recommending this!!

I got a professional spray tan before vacation, but needed an SPF that wouldn’t fade the tan. This was perfect!

This product is great even for someone of my race. It works well and it helps to protect your skin from the rays of the sun especially being in a sunny area.

Was looking for something melanated skin friendly and this is perfection! I use it as lotion as well!

Great, easy spread, grat moisturizing and no odor. Very happy

The media could not be loaded. I’ve been using this sunscreen for a while now and i wills forever use it. A lightweight sunscreen that’s hydrating to the skin and doesn’t leave a white cast. ( Black skin friendly)  The Formula is really hydrating and can feel oily or greasy if you have oily skin or used with a very heavy moisturizer. Fix this by skipping moisturizer and using it as a 2 in one to moisturize and protect. Also works well under makeup .  It is slightly fragranced but nothing overwhelming. I love this formula!! Get it girlies.

Easy to apply with no white cast.

It’s really moisturizing and good for colored skin doesn’t stay white on the skin.

This is just I was looking for No scent and protected welk

I’ve heard the best sunscreen is the one you’re actually going to use and this is it! I’ve spent many hours listening to dermatologists and dermalogical chemists and I think I’ve found “The One”. Major selling points: I genuinely enjoy using this product Leaves NO cast! Fragrance free!!! Chemical sunscreen w/o oxybensone Doesn’t burn my eyes Locks in moisture due to the bees wax Doesn’t break me out as an oily skin and acne prone person . Can use on face and body ✨✨

I don’t know if I did anything wrong or if I mixed it with something that I wasn’t supposed to mix it with. I didn’t even wore it to the beach, just once to go to my job, and I was only exposed to sunlight for 20 minutes and it wasn’t even directly. Next thing Yk my face is burning really bad and after I washed my face, the skin came off

eos-eos

I bought sunscreen because YouTube dermatologist have convinced me that I need to wear sunscreen everyday so I do. However, I bought this brand because of Australia’s standards in terms of sunscreen quality. I don’t like sunscreen really because I tried the worst brands but this one is lovely!!! I LOVE how natural and glowly the finish is. The smell does not bother me at all even if it’s fragrance free. It’s very moisturizing and easy to work with.

eos-eos

I've been attempting to be better about wearing sunscreen every day, but the sunscreen I was using left a gross film on my skin. This was recommended, so I tried it, and it's fantastic.  It spreads easily, absorbs quickly, and is fragrance-free. No nasty film on my skin after applying!

eos-eos

As soon as I opened the package, it was completely drenched in the sunscreen. My first instinct was to open it up of course, but it was sealed. Right when I squeezed it, product was coming up from the edge. A lot of wasted product. Wanted a refund and am going to get one, but there’s no point in sending back an item that’s soaked in its own sunscreen with very little product inside with a hole in the edge of it..

eos-eos

First, it's larger than I expected. It is safety sealed. It has no scent, which is what I wanted. It's very moisturizing, and it's never crept in my eyes. I love it!

I haven’t tried this suntan lotion in the sun yet but it feels wonderful on my skin. It is very moisturizing and easy to spread. No scent which is nice.

eos-eos

I break out easily with spf but this has not had that effect on me. The smell isn’t bad it spreads easily and really keeps you moisturized like almost all day. It doesn’t leave a white cast. And according to the internet it’s a safe spf to use so I recommend buying it. I’ve been using to for 3 months now. And I’m obsessed

eos-eos

I use it everyday as a face sunscreen and it bends perfectly. It does have quite a glow after application but within about ten minutes it settles in. It’s also great under makeup!

eos-eos

It’s a good sunscreen don’t get me wrong it’s “Dewey “ with just means greasy and sweaty look, but over all I like it but I have a bit of acne, so people with acne prone skin don’t worry this won’t break u out just might make your acne look a lil irritated and make it stand out kore but over all not a bad sunscreen , no white cast at all.

eos-eos

Too greasy for my oily skin. Maybe it works better on dry skin

eos-eos

It’s a good sun screen that sits quickly. The only thing is it drips if you’re sweating or trying to do ablution (I’m Muslim). I prefer the black girl sun screen if I have to do my ablution after applying sunscreen.  Otherwise it’s a very good product and I recommend it

eos-eos

I have had a hard time finding a sunscreen, that had no white cast, and no piling, but I finally found it! It works great under makeup, and it’s moisturizing without feeling oily.
