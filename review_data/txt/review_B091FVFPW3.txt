I love the easy to spray application of this sunscreen. I was tired of the thick cream and how long it would take to rub it in. We went on fall break, and I knew I must find an alternative to save our skin from the sun. I bought various versions of this brand of spray, but had to get this one for sensitive skin. No reactions, and it gave complete protection from the sun. I would recommend and purchase this again.
