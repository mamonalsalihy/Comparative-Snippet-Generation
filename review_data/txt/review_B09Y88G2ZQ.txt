As far as I can tell, this doesnâ€™t contain salicylic acid. I donâ€™t think it will fight off acne or heal zits that have started, but it wonâ€™t clog pores and cause your to breakout more, either. Itâ€™s not oily but also doesnâ€™t dry my skin out. Works great under makeup!  Highly recommend it if you have acne prone skin! I started using it since Iâ€™m using a retinol cream at night. I kind of wish this was a higher SPF (50 would be nice).  Hope this helps! ðŸ˜„

PSA: The cap is NOT a screw cap! I assumed it was and thought I had a defective package because when I unscrewed the cap, I thought someone had really poorly designed the applicator. Then I realized that although you CAN unscrew the top, the actual cap is made to just be pulled off. Lesson learned!  Now that that's out of the way, I can say that I really like this sunscreen! It's super lightweight and doesn't even really feel like I have sunscreen on. My favorite facial sunscreen is Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen (SPF 40) because it goes on and feels like a primer and doesn't make me break out, but I'd say this Proactiv Clear Skin Face Sunscreen Moisturizer is a VERY close second. But it's way less expensive, so I think it would be worth it to switch. Compared to something like CeraVe Face Moisturizer with Sunscreen (a product I also sometimes use), this Proactiv is a dream. The CeraVe is heavier and feels greasier. The Proactiv also hasn't made me break out, despite 90+ degree heat, me sweating, and dust from watching T-ball practices and games.

This Proactiv Clear Skin Face Sunscreen Moisturizer With SPF 30 is the formula I have been wishing for in the sunscreen realm. I have tried everything out there for my face. I really gave up wearing sunscreen on my face because of all the side effects and how gross it made me feel. This sunscreen is different. It is light and gentle and mattifying. It works well with my foundation. And when I go foundation free, this makes my skin look polished and even. I have had no weird breakouts or irritation with this formula either. It's Proactiv, so I knew I would love it from the start!

I always have a hard time getting my husband to wear sunscreen. He says itâ€™s greasy and that it breaks him out. Heâ€™s a natural redhead and his Dad has had multiple cancers removed from his ears and head. He is actually pleased with this one, itâ€™s not too thick and itâ€™s not at all greasy. It applies easily and has not bothered his sensitive skin.

This lightweight, non-comedogenic sunscreen did not clog my pores or cause any breakouts on my face. It blends really well into the skin, and does not leave any cast on the skin.  I have used Proactive products for our acne before, so it is a brand I know and trust. Iâ€™ve lately preferred mineral sunscreens, but I found this enjoyable to use on my face too. It leave a very pleasant matte texture and you have a hard time telling that youâ€™re wearing sunscreen instead of just regular facial lotion. There is a mild sunscreen scent, so I avoided getting it too close to my eyes as they are sensitive to sunscreen scents.  I used it when I went out for a run and it held up to an hour of sweating. My only complaint is that I wish the tube was a larger size than just 1.5oz, considering the full retail price. However, my review rating does not consider price, as different shoppers have different budgets.

I was pleasantly surprised with the performance and use of the Proactiv Clear Skin Face Sunscreen. The standard white lotion base is mild and hydrating without feeling heavy, sticky, or greasy. Had excellent spreadability and melts into skin, leaving me with a semi-matte finish all day. Be sure to apply to lips, ears, neck, etc. all exposed areas daily. Especially if you suffer from acne. Acne is a wound and this damaged skin developed more pigment in response to UV exposure to protect itself. When using BHAs and AHAs, vitamin C and the like, you are making the skin more sensitive to UV as well. So use SPF daily, rain or shine, year-round. This one is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive. Shouldn't cause flares or breakouts. No essential oils or added fragrances.

Broad spectrum, daily use facial sunscreen from the well known acne-treatment skincare company. Light, and non-comedogenic, this doesn't leave a white cast or oily shine on skin. Not waterproof, so more for day-to-day use than a day at the beach. Not bad, and I do like that it doesn't leave you overly shiny, but better sunscreens out there, like Supergoop's Unseen.

Mine came in a box, sealed except the bottom seal had been cut, so I suspect this was used. Otherwise, the sunscreen is pretty good. It's pretty thin, and way too much came out of the pump than I needed. I had to carefully unscrew the pump to put the extra back in. $24 isn't out of the ordinary, but it isn't cheap either; I wasn't going to waste it! It smells like sunblock - not the good kind, but not awful. It absorbs well without cast and isn't greasy. Being from Proactiv, I have confidence I don't have to worry about this causing acne.

This product is great! Itâ€™s a simple sunscreen/moisturizer combo thatâ€™s perfect for the face (and hands actually). I have a naturally oily face, so Iâ€™m always looking for products that donâ€™t contribute extra greasiness. This one is perfect! Itâ€™s moisturizing without making my face/pores feel clogged or oily. And itâ€™s hydration is impressive. I even used it on my hands randomly because I didnâ€™t have lotion and I was so impressed with how hydrated they felt. Overall a really quality product, totally recommend!

This is a perfectly fine chemical sunscreen. It is pretty lightweight. Itâ€™s not greasy nor does it leave a residue on the skin after drying down. Doesnâ€™t sting the eyes either.  I find it a little too matte for my dry/combo skin, but my boyfriend who is oily can wear it without issue. The price for the volume is not ideal for me. In terms of formula and affordability, we will likely stick with our Missha spf. This is a fine choice for anyone that is oily though.

Finally a face sunscreen that doesnâ€™t leave me shiny and greasy! I put this on in the morning and it soaks right in. No white cast. You donâ€™t even know youâ€™re wearing anything. I can easily put my makeup on over this without issues. Iâ€™ve never found a sunscreen before that actually makes my skin more shine free! This is my new holy grail. I just wish the bottle was larger.

So this looked great/disappeared on skin, doesn't smell like anything, and seems to protect from the sun just as you'd expect, but to be honest I only wore it once because it burned my eyes so badly all day. I definately wouldn't wear this when you are going to be sweating or getting wet. Im going to try again in the winter.

I really love this sunscreen. It goes on easily and spreads smoothly, it absorbs quickly and fully leaving no residue behind on my skin. It provides great sun protection while feeling like I have nothing on my skin. This is currently priced at $24 which I think is a fair price.

The ProActive Clear Skin Face Sunscreen comes out white from the pump tube dispenser but doesn't cause any whitecast. It is easily absorbed into the skin and doesn't feel sticky or greasy. I keep it in my everyday bag and am able to apply it even while exercising.

This is a good daily moisturizing 30spf cream. However, there is no water resistance so not a great option for the pool or beach.

Iâ€™ve always hated the way sunscreens feel on my oily, acne-prone skin. No matter what they say, theyâ€™re usually thick and uncomfortable. This one by Proactive is pretty good, though. Lighter than most, no white cast, and no breakouts so far (although to be fair, I always use benzoyl peroxide underneath). My only complaint is you get a tiny tube for a relatively high price.

A nice SPF that protects against sun damage but also keeps your face hydrated and blemish free!
