I bought this before our trip to cancun, the sunscreen is very light and easy to apply, it doesn't smell like the other brands and make my skin feel very moisturized as well. I do suggest to wait until it completely dried before enter water, and avoid around eyes completely. it tends to melt and get into eyes.

I think my bottle was damaged. It didn’t spray on with a fine mist, but thick and chalky. Very white and took a lot to rub in. I won’t buy this again.

Check the nozzle before your return window closes. It didn't work at all, but I had bought it well ahead of my vacation to Hawaii. Now, I am out the purchase price.

This product is wonderful. I use it regularly. I originally bought this brand when I was vacationing in Portugal. I was happy to see that Amazon carried it when I returned to the United States. The spray is not overly toxic like most USsunscreens. I use this to apply sunscreen even directly to my face and my children's. Something you cannot do with the United States sunscreen brands. Most spay sunscreen cans tell you to not apply to your face. With this brand it's not an issue. Your eyes are less likely to sting as the spray does not seem to be alcohol-based, and it is a very good moisturizer as well as sunscreen.

I bought three of them, one on/off button doesn't work. I am going to return or get replacement but they said that It is not eligible to return for no reason. I need to talk to customer service.

This product is definitely not as it’s described. It is SO oily and greasy, comes out in droplets, and made me breakout. You’ll most likely have to wash it out, if it gets in your hair due to the greasiness. I purchased it to use while I was wearing makeup which was a big fail. I wouldn’t purchase this again, due to how oily it is. I also don’t feel like it gives me as much protection on my face as other products I’ve tried.

Stars are for the product quality not for the bottle... I really like La Roche-Posay, and I was waiting something easy to spray and light feeling. But it is the exact sun milk with the bottle and spraying is a nightmare...

no me agrado porque dice que lo puedes usar para la cara y no es asi entra en los ojos aunque los protejas ;en el sol arden los ojos como no tienes idea y en la boca un mal sabor, talvez para el cuerpo sea bueno pero para la cara NO

I really wanted to try this sunscreen. I finally splurged and bought it as it’s a little more expensive. The cap was broken and it was difficult to get it to spray. I wanted to like the sunscreen itself so bad, but it just isn’t for me. I would return it if it was eligible for return. It is super greasy and oily. It looked like I rubbed grease on my face. Not a fan!
