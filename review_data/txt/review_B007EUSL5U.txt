I was looking for a good sunscreen to use over my makeup (to reapply in the afternoons) and immediately wondered if la roche posay made one as I absolutely love all their other products and use them extensively for my young children and myself over the years. Well this is advertised as being light and non greasy but unfortunately it fell short of its claims. I sprayed it close to my face and it left a white gloopy mess, after blending it into my skin it looked super greasy. The spray is also not a good idea for the facial area unless you want to have sunscreen all over your eyelashes/eyebrows and hairline (but obviously, this is my own fault for not thinking about it earlier). I will stick to using this for my body..

I needed the best sunscreen I could get because we were going to the desert in the summer for a week. I knew I would burn and needed help. Then I read about this sunscreen. It is from Europe and you cannot find it here in the states. I went to the desert, hiked, swam in the river and the lakes, had a blast with my hubby and friends and DID NOT BURN. I am blond with freckles, blue eyes, and I totally burn so easily. I spent hours in the sun, yeah with a hat on, and this sunscreen. I came home with golden skin, but not burned. Love this stuff.

This product is wonderful. I use it regularly. I originally bought this brand when I was vacationing in Portugal. I was happy to see that Amazon carried it when I returned to the United States. The spray is not overly toxic like most USsunscreens. I use this to apply sunscreen even directly to my face and my children's. Something you cannot do with the United States sunscreen brands. Most spay sunscreen cans tell you to not apply to your face. With this brand it's not an issue. Your eyes are less likely to sting as the spray does not seem to be alcohol-based, and it is a very good moisturizer as well as sunscreen.

The single best sunscreen I've ever used. Amazing protection, with no greasiness or stickiness. It's pricey, but worth every penny. I first use this while traveling to Europe three summers ago, and was sold. Returning to the US I was unable to find it locally for a long time until this summer. Now it's something I'm considering having on a recurring order on Amazon!

I bought this before our trip to cancun, the sunscreen is very light and easy to apply, it doesn't smell like the other brands and make my skin feel very moisturized as well. I do suggest to wait until it completely dried before enter water, and avoid around eyes completely. it tends to melt and get into eyes.

I am scared to try new products because of my sensitive skin but this cause no irritation, stinging or redness! Used it for vacation and will buy again. I have oily skin so it seeped into my eyes which caused irritation but that’s normal with most sunscreen.

This is the best quality sunscreen I have been able to find. It keeps your skin protected all day without having to reapply a million times.  The spray as a liquid cream that you have to run in so I dont think the spray bottle is any better than a tube. But the quality of the actual sunscreen is spot on.

eos-eos

Essential sun screen that is easy to wear, apply & great protection.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is the best sunscreen I have ever tried. It is very lightweight compared to any other sunscreen and it does not leave any white residues. Other sunscreens often stain dark colored surfaces and this one doesn't!  Highly recommend it!

Recommended to me by a pediatrician years ago, have been using this brand since for 8 years. Always happy with it, even for super sensitive skin to the sun (like beyond sunburn—inflammatory reaction). It’s relatively expensive, quality really delivers though.

El mejor protector que he conseguido, tengo una piel muy delicada ( tengo psoriasis) y debo protegerme siempre y con este protector conseguí que sea fácil de aplicar absorbe tan bien y protege y a mis hijas se los coloco y no les pica

husband read consumers report on this sunscreen. got it before vacation. he tans easily, i burn before i step out the door. worked well for both of us.

Not quite as greasy as others and I love the ingredients. The spray is moderately easy to use but once you spray it on your hand to spread on your kids, the whole bottle is quite slippery.  Does the job!

I love La Roche-Posay products. I've been using them for a couple of months and I love how soft my skin feels. I was waiting for this sunblock for a while. Now I'll ne able to use it.

eos-eos

I really like it.

While I love this brand and use the lotion version on my face all the time, I'm not convinced on the spray. You cannot hold it close, which makes it hard to focus on small areas if you're already wearing clothes. I supposed you could spray into your hand then spread it on your skin but at that point you might as well get another lotion bottle. Just feels like it won't last long at all.

eos-eos

Expensive, but love the feel of this sunscreen- and no terrible smell either- worth the price

This La Roche-Posay Ultra- Light Sunscreen is my favorite. It is smooth on the skin and it is not sticky at all! I really recommend it for any kind of skin! It is the best product!

eos-eos

I enjoy many La Roche-Posay products including their wonderful companion “face and body” lotion, ”Anthelios 60 Melt-In Sunscreen Milk.” What is the point of a spray if it requires copious amounts of rubbing? Also, with a spray, you later risk the clogging of the exit point, and, down the road, losing sufficient propellant to use all that you paid for! Still, the lotion shoots out very unevenly, thick, streaking white that is impossible to adequately apply. It stained my test areas white (shoulders to elbows) for the life of the applications—over two hours! (And, I am VERY light skinned!) It is a different viscosity than the tube of “sunscreen milk”—I suppose designed that way for a spray? The 5 oz. spray can was $35.99 with Amazon and the recently, previously purchased 5 oz.-tube of lotion (which is nicely, evenly absorbed without white streaking) was also $35.99 at a local drugstore, CVS, but, with a California sales tax of 8.25%. Invest in the lotion for a superior product!

My dermatologist highly recommended this to me. This is what she uses because there is 2 ingredients this has that the traditional sunblock doesn’t have.

Love this so much better than other spray sunscreens. It comes out white so you can see where it got sprayed. It rubs in easily and doesn't leave you feeling sticky. I hate the feeling of the others on my skin. I also haven't burnt and neither have my kids. This one gets an A+ in by book.

eos-eos

The BEST. I use it on face and body for adults and kid. It’s the only thing that protects our sensitive skin against the sun.

Great sunscreen. I love it. Works great.

Waste of money!! Does not work like the lotion. I still burned.

This is a great product; a bit pricey, but it lasts for a while. There is a very nice texture and feel to applying the product and it rubs in easily.

The sunblock is creamy and it’s great. I highly recommend it

Warning: La Roche-Posay makes two (2) version of this sunscreen 1) The original European version. 2) An American version. The European version is called Anthelios XL SPF 60 Sunscreen and has Trisiloxane (Mexoryl XL) which has been in widespread us in Europe for years and is far superior to US approved sunscreens. The US version sold on this site is called Anthelios 60 (NO XL AFTER THE NAME) and basically it is a super expensive version of the same stuff you can by at any US supermarket for $7 or less. Don't be fooled!

I burn easily and have dealt with skin cancer off and on for some time so I'm very particular about what I choose for sun protection. After using La Roche-Posay Anthelios sunscreen for several months now, I can't say enough good things about it! It never feels sticky, in fact, it's not even noticeable. I can go to the beach and work in my garden without worry (or sunburns). Perfect!

eos-eos

It's always been difficult for me to find sunscreen that I can use on my body or face. I'm super-sensitive to the perfumes in sunscreen so was glad to find this one. It's light enough for my face and body. Non-greasy and no harsh scent. It's definitely worth the money for me. I've thrown out lots of other sunscreen products, but this one is a keeper.
