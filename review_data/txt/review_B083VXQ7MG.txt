I got this to put sunscreen on my children's faces because I have the goopiness of liquid and feeling the greasiness of sprays when I'm applying it on them. This stick is perfect because it allows me to hold it at an angle for precision in those delicate areas by the eyes/nose... And keeps my hands clean !the kids say it smells good .

I got this for my son during summer camp and it is absorbs easily no white marks.

My son had a bad reaction to my face sunscreen so I got this. No reaction. Not the easiest to spread but that's okay. It is also a very small stick but is lasting so far.

Quarter for size reference. Appeared to be regular size - bought one 3xs the size for half the cost.

I bought this when I found out that BL made sunscreen in a stick and I heard it was great for kids faces. I like the fact that it’s easy to use when applying sunscreen to my baby and toddler. It’s perfect for using on their face. Before I was using the regular sunscreen and applying it to a beauty blender when applying sunscreen on to their face. That works great too but the stick is so much better and easier. The only thing I wish was that the stick was bigger. That’s why I left 4 stars and not 5. Kind of pricey for a little stick.

I know this brand is amazing and works so I gave all stars but for the price and size I'll say it left me speechless. Almost wanted to laugh at his small and ridiculous it is to the price. I guess lesson learned but it'll get used, just wish it was bigger.

Love how easy this is to apply to my kiddos face. Still need to rub it in, but appreciate how easily it applies to the skin. The stick is small, and you can’t leave it in direct heat otherwise it will melt. The only two things to think about! But would happily buy it again.

My kids HATES having sunscreen put on but she doesn't mind this for her face!

I bought this to use on my toddler grandson. After researching for a safe, effective sunblock for children this came out on top. It is very easy to apply and stays on well.

Works great on the move for quick application. Stands up to pool and salt water. No sun burn yet.
