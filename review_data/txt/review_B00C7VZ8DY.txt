Living in a sunny climate this product is a must. I not only use it as a daily sunscreen but also use it on our boat. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me. I have been a loyal user for many years.

I've used for several years since I'm susceptible to sun damage. Goes on smoothly under my makeup. Moisturizing rather than greasy.

eos-eos

I love it and wont use anything else!!!

Love it! Good for my skin (I have hyperpigmentation). Good size, I used It 5-6 months everyday. No allergic reaction, does not clog pores. But its bleached (makes white skin)

This is the best sunscreen I have ever tried. It is zinc-based and chemical free, but rubs in translucent, so you don't have that phantom-like appearance you do with other sunscreens. I find I am more likely to put it on knowing I don't have to be insecure about having a bluish-white glow. I read about this brand in a WSJ article, and I am so glad I took the recommendation. This is now the brand of choice for my family!

Perfect

This product was recommended to me by my sister's plastic surgeon. I REALLY need a product that works, because my face gets those awful sun spots very easily. So I am religious about applying it. Well, it's just great! I'm on my fourth bottle now, and it has always protected me well. And I live in Colorado, where we're at a high altitude and the sun is fierce. I saw some reviews that said it leaves your face looking white. I'm so surprised. I find it rubs in very well, and is invisible. Perhaps the people using it didn't rub it in - just smeared it on, perhaps? I don't know, but I've never had that problem. (My hubbie uses it on his bald spot too, because it disappears on application. Heh.)

nice consistency, and lays nicely, pleasant consistency but doesn't last long, not sure about how much protection is really inside but I got burnt and learned to apply more often,. it will not protect you for half a day applied jsut once. I am a red head and got really burnt in the face with the thick layer of this cream,... so I ll apply more often

I’ve bought it after having watched an interview with my favourite fashion model She said she was using this cream and it was absolutely perfect for her But when I started using it I understood that it is a simple sun protection cream with no other benefits And it can block your pores if you have oily skin It is good enough , but overpriced I have another cream which is 50 spf and more lightweight on your skin and also makes you skin lighter and evens your skin tone - and the price is lower

The product is good......at first. I am now through my third tube with a total mess after getting through about 2/3 of the sunscreen in each tube. Something is wrong with the tube manufacturing. As the sunscreen gets used it begins to form some kind of coagulation from the disintegrating tube. Whatever is happening in the tube mixes with the sunscreen and it become a holy mess on your skin. In additiion, I took the last tube on vacation and threw it in my bag. The outside of the tube began cracking and so the colors ( blue, silver and white of the tube) ruined my wallet by breaking up and adhering to the wallet and other items in my Louis Vuitton handbag. After significant research, I have I been unable to find and contact the manufacturer.  I can't possible be the only person to whom this has happened. I am on my last of what will be my final and third tube. I have had to cut open the tube, place the sunscreen in a different container and finish using it that way. Dreadful!

It appears a little white when I initially put it on my face. But the white disappears within a minute. I think it did a great job of blocking the sun. I just feel like it’s so expensive for those few ounces.

This sunscreen is well worth the price! It works, doesn't leave any chalky white streaks when I apply it, and it doesn't aggravate my perioral dermatitis!

eos-eos

This works. No sun gets through. I love the feel and it does moisturize too. I've used it for several years. I use it every day under makeup but I also use it when we go to the beach for my sun-sensitive kids. They never get any sun.

eos-eos

It does not irritate my sensitive skin, even after using retin-A. It smells nice, has a good consistency, non-greasy, easy to apply, and soaks in clear. No white face look. Also very effective as long as you re-apply.

Very good product and feels great on skin

Best sunscreen for sensitive skin, does not break me out

I liked this a lot. Feels clean going on and works well.

This sunscreen has the best texture. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin.

eos-eos

Smooth and protecting

eos-eos

Fantastic, love it.

Great product, fast delivery. Will buy again.

The texture is nice and fluffy. It's like whipped cream. Unfortunately, this makes my dry patches appear really dry yet super greasy on other areas at the same time... I wanted to like it because it doesn't leave much of a white cast like other physical screens, but can't.

eos-eos

I was very, VERY disappointed in this product. I bought it to take with my family on a cruise through the Caribbean, and it was not effective AT ALL. We applied as directed, and I'm very religious about reapplying sunscreen every hour or two on me, my husband, and my two ten-year old sons. Unfortunately we all burned. Maybe it was just our skin type, but I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this product. Also, I'm just a mom who cares about skin and I have so ties to this company or its competitors. It's just a product that does not work. iS Clinical, you should be ashamed of yourselves for having this on the market.

This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist about 1 year ago. I have been using it every morning for over a year and I absolutely love it. It doesn't break out my skin and its not greasy. Some people have said that it leaves your face white but you have to spread it really good and you're set!

eos-eos

The product isn't as clear as I thought it would be. However I work in construction so I'm not really going for style points. Protects well in the sun and performs well even when I sweat. Would have given it 5 stars if it were more sweat proof.

eos-eos

First off let me say I have always disliked sunscreens. However, at 65 years of age and two bouts off skin cancer later I must use a sunscreen.This product works fine. Absorbs pretty well. Does the job and is better than any other sunscreen I have tried. I use this on the arms and legs, on the face I use Revision Intellishade Original.

eos-eos

I like how it feels on my skin. I can even apply it on my face. It doesn't leave a white film like other sunscreens.

eos-eos

This is very heavy and white. Not light and transparent as i expect it. I only use it when i am not wearing makeup over it, otherwise you will have 'white face'.

I always had a pretty rough relationship with sunscreens because when applied on my sensitive skin, they use to cause breakouts almost instantaneously. This phobia of sunscreen made me miss out on the trend of mineral based sunscreens. So after a pretty rough summer, I decided to give mineral based sunscreen a try and bought iS Clinical Eclipse because it was recommended by a couple of "Top Ten Lists" on the internet. This time around, I wasn't disappointed. I am a 24 yr old male with an olive skin complexion and hyper pigmentation on one side of my face. The thing with olive skin complexion is that you can get tanned very easily. Thats a big plus if tanning happens uniformly but with me this is not the case. Therefore, I need to use a sunscreen. iS Clinical Eclipse is almost transparent and the best thing is, your face doesnt feel oily once you apply the product. I also noticed one thing else, whenever I applied this product on a wet face, an ugly pimple would end up rearing its head. So dont apply it on a wet face. After using this product for almost 6 months, I would definitely recommend this to a friend.

Love this sunscreen. Doesn't feel thick or oily on my skin. It is very lightweight.

in a 105 heat index in Hanoi, the sunscreen turned my face a streaky white

eos-eos

I really wanted to like this stuff. But, it's not a good product to be putting on your face unless you're going surfing or hiking and want people to know that you have sunscreen on. It doesn't absorb and leaves a white film on your face. Also, my skin hates mattifying products cause they always get flaky after having them on for a few hours. But, I would recommend this product for surfers.

I had been searching for a translucent sunscreen that wouldn't break me out or make me have an allergic reaction. Well I've finally found it and I am in love with it! I tried the Elta MD clear sunscreen but I ended up having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in some physical sunscreens (Octinoxate) then I switched to the Elta MD tinted sunscreen for extra sensitive skin since that one only had zinc and titanium dioxide however this stuff made me break out and I never liked the tint. This sunscreen goes on white however after about 5 minutes of letting it absorb into your skin it gives such a beautiful dewy glow! I swear I've never had my skin look this good with any other products. I won't even wear much makeup with it, just put on a little blush and my skin looks amazing! I highly recommend this sunscreen and am very happy with it.

I've been using this daily for about a year and a half now and I really like it (and haven't even gone through one bottle). It was suggested to me by a dermatologist and I really like it. It's a little thick, but my skin (combo) absorbs it well and quickly. It also layers very easily. The only downside is it HURTS when it gets into your eyes. Every now and then if I'm sweating or my eyes are watering and I wipe them some of the sunscreen gets in my eyes and it's really difficult to get the pain to stop (kind of like when you rub your eyes when there's pepper on your hands). Other than that I'd recommend.

eos-eos

I’ve search for a long time to find a good face sunblock. This is not greasy, oily or leaves a white residue on your skin. Very hydrating and lasts all day. I’ll keep purchasing This product.

eos-eos

Pros Delivered on time + good service. This sun screen, looks good, feels good to touch & is made with good products. Cons: Smears on like a skin, hardy absorbs and lies on top of the skin almost like a second layer and is clearly visible for some time. I would not recommend or repurchase for these reasons.

Meine Kosmetikerin hat mir dieses Produkt empfohlen. Daher hatte ich schon eine Erwartung an die Creme, die allerdings nicht erfüllt wurde. Die Creme zieht schlecht ein und hinterlässt auf der Haut einen weißen Schmier und kleine weiße Kügelchen. Auch reicht die Feuchtigkeit für meine trockene Haut nicht aus um ein angenehmes Hautgefühl zu bekommen. Ich kann die Creme nicht weiterempfehlen und würde sie mir definitiv auch nicht nochmal bestellen.
