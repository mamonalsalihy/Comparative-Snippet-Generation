The label on the bottle does not match the advertising for this product. No where on the label does it list zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Instead the first listed active ingredient Avobenzone 2.4% , Homosalate 12%, Octisalate 4%, Octocrylene 4.8%. Not one of these ingredients were advertised, instead the label advertised stated Zinc Oxcide and Titanium Dioxide. We bought this as it was advertised as a mineral base broad spectrum sunscreen. I am sure it is a sunblock, but we specifically purchased it because of what was not in it. When we recieved it the label stated it contained active and inactive chemicals that were not listed in the advertised label. Extremely disappointing and inconvenient to return. Not a happy customer.

This is the ultimate sunscreen for sun protection. I hike all summer in strong sun at high altitude where the atmosphere is thinner and the solar radiation much stronger - Had been looking for a serious mineral sunscreen and this one does not disappoint. It will protect your skin! Be aware that it is so strong it does leave a white sheen on your skin, so you have to be okay with that. To me, totally worth the sun protection and the white color does reduce after a few hours. Plus the price is quite good for a mineral sunscreen.  Here is the thing to understand. Mineral sunscreens like this reflect solar radiation off, so it doesn't get into your skin. Chemical sunscreens instead "absorb" the radiation. I didn't understand this until recently but I finally have an explanation why the chemical sunscreens with crazy high spf like 50-70 again and again worked less well than the mineral spf 30. Mineral sunscreen is just more effective. Also good for people who are concerned about the chemicals in the chemical based sunscreens.

This product is a great mineral sunscreen that has sufficient coverage and keeps kids from getting excess sun exposure, which is the biggest priority. i can't believe how many people have complained that it makes them look too white. Perhaps they didn't realize that skin protection is the whole point?!? Guess what? Skin cancer doesn't look all that awesome either. So i couldn't care less if my family has a white hue if it is doing its purpose, which is providing a sun screen barrier to protect our skin. The pump is super convenient too. i leave it in our entry way and we all just apply on the way out the door without holding onto a slippery bottle or dropping a cap etc. Great product.

What I like about this product is that it a really good sunscreen for kids. When I put it on my kid, it stays there for a long time. I think it does pretty good at blocking the rays. At bath time, I kind of have to scrub my kid hard to remove what didn't get washed away during the day's play. I would buy this all over again.

Grandson and I both have delicate alabaster skin, and goal of him learning to swim this summer. But more than that we live in a desert. So it is going by the door, to keep him safe everyday and into a travel bottle in both our bags. Great value.

I canâ€™t wait to use this! Zinc is super effective !!! Thank you for making this product ! Iâ€™m African American and my nose starts peeling bad and regular sunscreen only washes off of your face when surfing but the past zinc products Iâ€™ve used always stay on. Who cares if ya look dorky ! Safer than sorry and painful

I used this product while on a caribean cruise and loved it. I applied it before leaving my room to the sun deck and I didn't burn. I also used this in conjunction with the just natural nutritive body serum, and came back really tanned with no burns, will definitely re order. It is very thick. I rubbed a small amount on my fingers then applied it.

I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and was surprised they vary significantly. I recently threw out any sun protection products that contained chemicals. Then I was on a mission to find a UVA/UVB broad spectrum mineral sunscreen that contained both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. This product contains both (zoom onto Drug Facts on this page). I did many stupid things as a teenager trying to get an instant tan in foggy San Francisco and paid the price. Today I am much more cognizant of the dangers of the sun. Daily I use a moisturizer with SPF 50 on my face, 365 days a year whether indoors or out. For long hours gardening, however, I use SPF RX Sunscreen. It goes on white. It stays white. It does NOT rub in. For me, that is a definite plus. Of course, I also wear sunglasses and a wide-brimmed sun protection hat. I do not understand the reviews that state this product comes in a bottle with chemical ingredients included. The product I received is in a tube exactly as shown.

Super good sunscreen with the right ingredients in it per my dermatologist. I was at the beach a week and got NO sunburn thanks to this product.

There are other products with zinc oxide that don't make you look like a stand-in cast member of The Walking Dead. Seriously, it leaves a visible white layer on your skin that is sticky. Save it for the beach so sand will stick. At any rate It will protect your skin from the sun's harmful radiations I will keep it for use in wilderness because it's bullet proof. I'll get another for social settings.  My dermatologist gave me samples of Solbar zinc oxide products. They go on smoothly, dry clear, and not sticky. I will be trying their sun protection products.  Follow-up 8/11/15: I have used the product after my initial review. What I've found is that the whiteness disappears after a half hour or so. So I am changing my rating to 5 stars. I would buy it again.

I took this product to Hawaii for my vacation recently and when I had my resort day I ended up burning within an hour, and the bottle states that reapplication needs to be after 80 minutes of swimming or every 2 hours if not. This product does not work when vacationing in Hawaii because you will burn easily. The product is very difficult to apply and doesn't apply evenly and will need additional time to spread out the white patches or residue that is left. When applying this product will turn your skin white and doesn't fade unless you shower and scrub it off. I purchased the product in advance and didn't start using it until my vacation which was my mistake because I would have returned it the next day have I tested it.

My dermatologist told me about using the titanium & sink blocker. What she sold was so expensive, I got on amazon and searched and searched until I found this. At first it left my skin white then (due to my very dry skin) I oil my face first - (you could use a lotion) - then I apply the block (A SMALL dot goes a LONG way ... then once worked in input on my foundation and other makeup. I like knowing I'm safer with a block. PS-every once in a while I'll get a little white flake that doesn't work into my skin, I remove it and disgard.

PROS -mineral sunscreen c-: -protects VERY well -makes ur skin feel like velvet, it def is not greasy, when you feel ur skin its like there's nothing there but there is at the same time, its a good feeling nonetheless :D -no scent so it doesnt interfere with ur body spray/perfume -waterproof so won't matter if you sweat -doesnt cause acne-> I use it on my face only when I jog cause my face sunscreen isn't waterproof so its never on my face that long -not that bad of a price for size and what ur getting, will last -all of these pros are in one sunscreen(hard to find..) CONS -weird to spread lol, like seriously just be prepared, this aint a normal "cream" basically when you first put it on its like water but then turns very thick and creamy and then its like URGHHHGGH to rub(do gentle circles pls don't abuse ur skin). you have to get used to rubbing this in but a few extra minutes of applying is such a small inconvenience for protected, soft, and not disgusting smelling skin. :) -apparently a white cast. im so pale I can't tell so im sorry I can't help with that :-c -you aint gonna carry this big bottle around so get a portable squirt thing container to put some into when you go to lunch or whatever

Nice to find a zinc sunscreen with no other chemicals. Since I work outside year round in the SoCal desert I need good protection and zinc is it. Who cares if it's a little white, white is better then cancer. I'm just working, not in a beauty contest. ðŸ˜Ž

Received fast and love the product!

Contains titanium oxide and zinc oxide, as recommended by dermatologists for those at risk for melanoma. Goes on easily and provides invisible protection for even the most sensitive skin. Works great to take the sting out of insect bites as well! I love this product!

arrived on time and as advertised

Product is beyond hard to rub in and get rid of that ghost white look. In fact it will take hours before it goes away if it even goes away at all. I apply 45 minutes before I leave for work, as I'm in construction, and even with a 1.5hr ride Im still rubbing it in. Wish I had only ordered the 32oz vs the gallon. I would return of simply throw it away. Will NOT be buying this mess again.

I'm happy I was able to find a sunscreen that combines the best active ingredients for sun protection Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide. I've used this combination for years and it works great for me. I use two brands, and one of them has become difficult to get therefore I was looking for alternative products with the same ingredient combination. Your product is good, however, seems to me that has liquid in it because when applied it doesn't applied evenly. As you continue smoothing it on the skin the liquid disperses and until then you can smooth the actual product evenly. I'm assuming the liquid part is what makes the product not greasy. Also, we all know that zinc oxide has a white finish, this product has an accentuated white finish that can be bothersome for some people especially women, but is not a big deal for me so long my skin gets the protection I want, I don't mind the white finish.

We bought this because our dermatologist recommended a sunscreen containing zinc and titanium. My husband has had several spots of melanoma removed so we take sun protection seriously. We just returned from Costa Rica and this sunscreen worked well. The best we have ever used. No burning and no skin sensitivity issues with either of us. No sun burn either! Apply in small amounts at a time, as it does tend to clump around the hairs on your skin, but applying in small areas at a time solved this issue. We liked that it is all natural and will not be harmful to the environment (save our reefs!) We will be buying this in a regular basis.

I donâ€™t know what the top reviewer is talking about. Hereâ€™s the label.  This stuff is awesome. While in Maui, I applied it every morning and at the end of a week here I donâ€™t even have tan lines from my sandals. That pretty much sums up how awesome this stuff is.  Yes, you will look a bit whiter than normal, but if you want to protect yourself against skin cancer, thereâ€™s always a tradeoff.

eos-eos

My skin is sensitive to most sunscreens. This is one of the few sunscreens I can use that wonâ€™t cause stinging on my face when applies. It does go in white and is more difficult to blend in, but that is not the product but the ingredients. I recommend this product if you fare sensitive and need good sun protection on dry land or in the water.

eos-eos

If you're looking for protection, take it from a 72 year old that just had skin cancer removed from my face. This is it. My Doctor said to get sun block with either zinc or titanium. This has both. It may give you a white tinge, but it makes me feel confident that this is doing the job it's suppose to. I see a lot of senior golfers have smartened up and look a bit like me out there, and that's a good thing! Great product at a great price.

The only two good things about this product are the value and the fact that it is a mineral sunblock without a bunch of added fragrance or other "junk" ingredients.  Bottom line: I dislike this product. It arrived with the inner seal disturbed, and the sunscreen itself was badly separated. Being in a large bottle with a pump, mixing it up once separated is very difficult. Even once getting out a bit of a well-mixed portion, it spreads unevenly.  I am very very pale (definitely a 1 on the Fitzpatrick skin type scale), and this still leaves a very white cast on my skin. It also rubs off easily on clothing, hands, e.t.c., even long after application. This causes me doubt in the sun- protection department, since it never seems to set up on the skin properly.  Reapplication is very important with sun block usage, and this is horrible to try and reapply midday. The first layer always dries out, showing textured patches on the skin, making the next layer even HARDER to spread. The white cast only intensifies... which is wild. I try to think of myself as looking like an upper-class 18th century Parisian, but really, I just look like rubbish.  I was going to return it, but I know that, most often, returned personal products just get sent to the landfill. I'm continuing to use it for home days, events where I'm mostly covered by other sun protective gear.. basically, any place where I'm not planning to be seen or really relying on it for adequate spf.  ... which means it is basically useless.

eos-eos

A good price for a large-sized mineral (reef safe) sunscreen. Be warned that the application is a much longer process (takes a long time to rub in compared to non-reef safe) and certainly leaves the skin with a much more ghostly appearance BUT it is necessary to protect the reefs from harmful chemicals if diving, snorkeling or swuming in marine sensitive areas.

eos-eos

This a very good sunblock. It does a good job at blocking the sun and it is very sweat proof. Beware however that with this type of sunblock it will look white where ever you apply it. If you apply this on your whole face, your whole face will look white as if you are wearing white make up base (this is the ONLY reason I did not give it a 5 star). Other than that it's an excellent product. A little goes a long way.

eos-eos

I like it, it applies more easily than the one I was currently using. What I do not like is that the expiration date is from this year, I received it now in February and it expires in September 2018 and I only use it for my face. I don't think I'll finish even one before it expires so the other one I will lose it. that is a failure. that's why I gave it 3 stars otherwise I would given it 5 ðŸ˜ž

eos-eos

The sunblock does the job in protecting my skin but this mineral sunblock is harder to spread than other mineral sunblocks, goes on super white and dries out my skin w/ consecutive use. All in all it does what I purchased it for and I read that applying moisturizing lotion beforehand can help with the dryness.

We bought this sunscreen for our Hawaii family vacation. Great value if you go for a 32 oz bottle. Not as easy to spread as conventional formulations, but not too bad either. Excellent sun protection, so highly recommended if you need reef-safe sunscreen.

eos-eos

i had very high expectations, but this product has some mayor flaws:  1. very (very, very) difficult to spread, so you cant get an even coat. and forget about applying on your back without help.  2. if you are successful aplying a layer over your skin, you will look pale as a vampire.

eos-eos

Really works great in the hot Florida sun. Great protection but the only problem is you have to put it on lightly otherwise you look like a white face clown if you use too much of it. I am very pleased with the protection that it offers and you can still tan through all this despite being protected. Just use it in small amounts.

eos-eos

We didn't get burned at all in Mexico with this. The problem with it is that is is very white and hard to get the white to go away. We bough it because it was reef safe. It did it's job but if you want to look good at the beach this is not the one to buy. I did last a family of for a week in Mexico with plenty left over.

This product definitely takes time to rub in and absorb. But the guide looked at it and said it was ok for coral reef, so that was primary goal in purchase, good to have 2 pack for party of 6.

I was really looking for a thick stay-on zinc paste for under my kidsâ€™ eyes while at the beach. Wore off like any other sunscreen. Plus it doesnâ€™t apply evenly- some parts of applying are thin and easily absorbed, while others are thicker and stay put. Was disappointed.

eos-eos

Pros: Easy to spread and not excessively greasy  Cons: Makes you look pale  Bought this stuff for daily use. It spreads very well as far as physical sunblock goes and doesn't leave your face too greasy. It does however make you look noticeably pale. Good for daily use (assuming you don't need to dress formal for work) or the beach. For special occasions you may need something more subtle. Four stars overall.

eos-eos

seems to work extremely well. very thick. Kind of hard to spread over hairy men's arms, legs or 5 oclock shaddow. Only need a small amount for each extremity. Doesn't wash off in water sports. Doesn't burn eyes. Doesn't stain clothes. No smell. Can see the whiteness though which looks kind of strange on my darker skin tone.
