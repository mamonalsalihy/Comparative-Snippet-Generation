Please never change this product!  PRO TIPS: Shake before use. Leave bottle upright so sunscreen doesn't dry out. Rub hands together with sunscreen and then apply. Really rub it in good. Dont apply too much at once, apply a little bit rub it in and then apply a second light layer.  Doing all this and you will have a barely noticeable white glow! And I have darker skin color! People complaining are not following these tips.

Update March 12, 2019: They changed the formula. I just opened a new tube and noticed that it glided on my face much better. The first ingredient is no longer shea butter but aloe vera gel. Argan oil is also added as the third ingredient before shea which makes it's more liquid. If any of you see the comment that says it's hard to apply, that's no longer true. I now can apply it on top of my vitamin C gel. They also add a bunch of antioxidant and plant extracts which help when you're exposed to the sun. At first, I'm a bit worried that my sensitive skin may react to those extract, but so far, it's all good.  The differences between the old and new formula; 1. The new one is much easier to apply but also more oily. You will need a bit of powder on top. 2. The new one is less chalky. Thus, it's better for a darker skin tone. However, the old one was a better primer if you have a light skin tone. 3. The new one no longer contains green tea extract. It was replaced with calendula extract and a bunch of herbal extracts which makes the smell more "herbal". This can be good or bad depends on how you like it. I'm fine with it.  Overall, I prefer the old formula for its superior primer effect and more matt. However, my skin seems to like them both equally.  Update on June 24, 2018: This 3 oz tube lasts sooo long. I also like that it's not separated into layers like some oil base sunscreen. The tube is not transparent, so I can't see how much left. Guessing from the weight, I think there's still around 1/4 left after 5 months of daily use on the face. My skin has almost no acne now besides some hormonal monthly acne. Will continue to use it for sure! :)  Orginal review: I have a dry yet sensitive and acne-prone skin, the worst combination ever! Since my favorite sunscreen was discontinued, I have been on a quest to find a replacement for a year. This sunscreen is the first one that has everything I'm looking for. It's moisturizing but has a matt finish. It acts like a primer and blurs my pore. I can easily put powder and concealer on top of it on the day I need to wear a makeup. On the day that I don't need a full coverage, I mix in a bit of foundation to "color" it.  The ingredients are full of antioxidant. The first 4 ingredients like Zinc, Shea butter, Calendula, and green tea extract are known acne fighters. I have been using it for just 10 days and the result has exceeded my expectation. Not only my pores has gotten smaller but ALL my inflamed acne has disappeared! This has never happened before except when I used 10% benzoyl peroxide (which cause my skin redness and flaky, so I had to stop using it). My skin now looks very healthy, no more redness, pimples, or dryness.  The cons: If you use vitamin C serum or any gel-like moisturizer, it tends to peel off when you put this sunscreen on top. I fix it by mixing a drop of Argan oil with the serum. If you're not acne-prone like me, other kitchen oils like olive oil etc. should be fine as well.  The reason for this long review is that I hope people will use it more so that Babo will not discontinue it. I hope I won't have to search for a new sunscreen again. That was not fun!

I really love this one. I've done a ton of homework on my mineral sunblocks and have also tried a bunch while searching for my unicorn of a product: non nano zinc, a high enough percentage of zinc, non comedogenic, water resistant, and not leaving a whitecast as much as possible. This product ticks all of those boxes plus is very lightweight and easy to spread, is cruelty free, made in the USA and the company is a certified B Corporation. I wish there were more in the tube but it's not even close to being as bad as the more expensive products I've come across. And for all of the pluses concerning this product, I won't hesitate to put my money towards buying this again.

This sunscreen applies pretty smoothly and doesn't clump up. It seems to be pretty water resistant based on my experience with using it while exercising. Removal is easy with an oil cleanser followed by my foaming salicylic acid cleanser. I'm sure any foaming cleanser would be sufficient, but I just want to make sure all of it is removed at the end of the day.  There is a noticeable white cast, but depending on how much you apply and if it's the second or later application, it's not too awful. I've been working from home, so it's not really a concern. Plus, I've gotten used to it.  What I really like is that it doesn't break me out. I've used mineral sunscreens from big brands that you'd think would make agreeable products and they broke my out. I don't normally rely on EWG scoring, but I definitely agree with the score for this sunscreen.  I highly recommend using a good moisturizer under this sunscreen. This is only a sunscreen. It doesn't moisturize. I use Vanicream facial moisturizer with it and there's no pilling. Even when applied minutes later.

We bought 4 coral reef safe sunscreens for our vacation and this was the only one we used constantly. Kept us from burning in 80 degree constant sun in the Caribbean. No real chalkiness like some of the zincs, a little liquidy so you get more than you plan( my spouse never remembered this). Worked great as long as we reapplied every few hours. Only downside was being a liquid that you had to rub in so that it wasn’t chalky means you had some exfoliating going on with any sand in the picture. But one 3 oz lasted all week for 2. But all in all this will likely be my go to reef safe sunscreen now.

Excellent sunscreen, and free of all the harsh chemicals found in many sunscreens. My daughter has very sensitive skin, and anything BUT this will break her face out within hours. This gives her no issues, and she has never burned- just be sure to follow the directions as to how often to re-apply. You need to rub it in well since it's a zinc sunscreen, but that's no big deal. Once rubbed in, its invisible (granted we are fair skinned, it may make a darker skinned person look a little ghostly), but we love this product. The spray on version is great, too.

This is my favorite brand of probably 8 different natural sunscreen brands. Less gooey and oily than other brands I have tried. Also less white appearance after rubbing it in. Best to shake it before squirting some out. (This one is more liquid than others, so shaking seems to work, whereas with most others I'd have to carefully kneed the container to mix it and avoid an oily mess coming out.)  I like this and it's affordable, but I actually use their sunscreen stick more often. It seems more secure in my bag, and the flat design of the SPF 30 sport stick is great! The outside of the case stays clean, it doesn't roll away, and it has a larger application area.

Babo Botanicals was rated 0 or 1 at ewg.org, meaning it's VERY safe. It doesn't contain any/much questionable ingredients. It truly didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I can still "feel" something is on my face, though it's totally tolerable. I'm realistic and I know I cannot have it all. I'd rather deal with the slight discomfort with physical sunscreen than getting all the possible cancer causing chemical sunscreens. The rate of skin cancer actually increased after sunscreen got popular. We don't know whether it's because people wrongly believe they're safe with sunscreens on and extend the hours of exposure, or it's because the chemicals provide more harm than benefit.

I did a little research looking for a safe sunscreen for me and my kiddos. I refuse to use your average toxic store bought sunscreen, especially on my little ones. This sunscreen goes on WAY easy for a zinc based sunscreen. I usually buy the Badger brand sunscreen, which works, but it was always a pain to apply and always left that white residue and you had to rub in forever. And this sunscreen seems to work well as every time I’ve remembered to apply it on my kiddos, they don’t get burnt. Same goes for me! Been using it in Texas the whole month of June and so far so good!! ❤️ I do make sure to reapply if they are playing in water for an extended period of time of course. Will continue to buy as long as the formula remains the same!

I was looking for something that was safe for my kids and for marine life. I was worried that it would be thick or leave heavy white streaks, but it melted right into their skin. They were on the beach wearing this sunscreen for a couple hours, and no sunburns at all. I’m very satisfied with this product.

eos-eos

In my opinion we all have sensitive skin and should be buying products that we’re going to put on our bodies that aren’t gonna irritate us. The sunscreen is one that I use for daily use after I apply my skin care regimen. It smells very natural and like minerals, it spreads easily and the white cast is very minimal I’d say for medium to fair skin. It washes off easily so I don’t recommend this for swimming but I did try the same brands spray on sunscreen-That one sticks a lot better in water. It hasn’t made me break out and it’s giving me good sun protection. I totally recommend for anyone

eos-eos

I did lots of research and tried a number of products when trying to find sunscreen for my red-headed, very-fair-skinned son. I love this. It’s natural zinc, but not greasy and also easy to spread…and trust me, that goes a long, long way with us as we put this on every day for summer camp. I can only apply once for day camp, and I do TRY to get him to wear a hat for additional protection while outside, which only sometime happens. He has never come home sunburnt though, so I really do trust this product!

eos-eos

Other sunscreens make me break out and I don't even have sensitive skin. This is pure zinc-oxide (the only chemical you need to protect your skin from the sun - so it speaks to my minimalism). There is no smell. it is not greasy - its easy to rub in. It does a decent job of protection but you do have to reapply every 80 minutes for it to work properly. This is a natural product so you do need to use a bit more. I used this all last summer and just got another for this summer. LOVE!

I tried out 3 new mineral sunscreens this summer, and I liked this one the best. It was effective as a sunscreen, spread easily, and left me looking the least pasty of the 3 I tried. It did not leave my skin greasy or cause breakouts. This is the one I will be ordering again!

eos-eos

I tan easily and mostly don't use sunscreen. But I wanted something to put on my decollete, since it gets the fiercest sun exposure - and tolerates it quite badly. As other reviewers have said it goes on white and needs to be rubbed in quite a bit. I suppose if you were trying to do your entire body it would be super annoying; but since I'm only doing a portion of my chest it's no big deal. And it certainly works!

eos-eos

I've tried several other mineral sunscreens (Badger, Raw Elements, ThinkSport, etc.), but this one rubs in the easiest without leaving a noticeable white cast, and it's the least greasy/oily. It's a bit difficult to rub in all the way on areas with a lot of body hair, but it still works better than others. I recommend this.

eos-eos

I thought I would give this clear zinc sunscreen a try. I'm older and those age spots are starting to show up. So after al little of my basic moisturizer I apply this sunscreen and it actually seems to make my skin look smoother with less lines. I just apply a little make up over it and voila, perfection. I volunteer with taking dogs outside to walk and use a play yard at my local SPCA so I am in the sun so I do feel that it has worked very well.

eos-eos

I love it! Love the way it spread and how it goes into the skin, doesn’t leave the skin super greasy either! I also like that it’s fragrance free!

I was searching for a safe sunscreen for my littlest and we love this! It spreads easily unlike other sunscreens I have tried. My son’s skin hasn’t burned despite being at the beach and pool all summer. A little goes a long way with this and I like that I don’t have to put toxic creams on him to keep him safe from the sun! Perfect and we love it!

I ordered this Babo sunscreen product, the Babo aerosol spray sunscreen and the Babo face stick sunscreen (all spf 30) to take on our Florida vacation last week. Upon arrival we coated our bodies down with these products and went to the beach. After about 1 hr we coated again. This is the result after only 3.5 hrs in the sun with repeat applications. Myself (in the pictures above), my husband and daughter all burned terribly. We all have olive skin tones and tan easily. My husband received the worst burns of his life. I tried to return these products and amazon will not allow the returns. Do not buy this brand.

I got this for a safe zinc daily sunscreen during pregnancy. I had tried other zinc options but they were so white they made me look sickly. This one has a very slight somewhat herbal scent which I actually quite like. It is in fact clear after you rub it in. It’s pretty thin in consistency so when you open the tube you don’t have to squeeze at all it just kind of spills out. Makes for a little messy application/control of amount of product but I don’t mind it. The finish is dewy and almost gives my skin a smooth plastic look which I like a lot as well. I can’t speak to the sun protection because it’s still winter where I live. I will continue using this brand in the future.

eos-eos

Love it! I bought this because it’s friendlier for the environment. I wish it came in a plastic-free container and that they had an option for a bigger size BUT i still love this product and am really happy with this purchase. It doesn’t have a strong smell, dries out pretty quick and doesn’t leave your skin sticky.

It's a natural sunscreen with zinc oxide as the active ingredient, so it is white and pasty, not clear. It's just a nature of zinc oxide. If it was clear it wouldn't have enough of active ingredient to be effective as a sunscreen. I moisturize my skin before using it with a moisturizer, and it helps in spreading the sunscreen. I like zinc oxide because it's not only a harmless ingredient but actually helps in healing the skin. I can use it when I have a break out and it clears it faster. My husband had a long problem of peeling skin on his hands from washing things. I asked him to try this sunscreen with a moisturizer and after he puts it on his hands at night he wakes up with nice, smooth hands. I bought an additional tube for him.

Bought this during my pregnancy as well as multiple other mineral lotions. I found this one to be the easiest to rub in.

I really love that it’s organic and it glides on my skin really nicely. There is no Strong and noticeable odor like many of the other sunscreens I have tried. I would recommend This sunscreen.

Excellent product for those who may be allergic to other sun screen products. I've found that when using most name brand sun screens, I have a very uncomfortable allergic reaction: a raised and itchy rash that lasts for several days. This zinc-based lotion causes no such issues, and has very little odor. It does leave some whitish residue if not spread quickly and evenly, but to me that's a small price to pay in exchange for good sun protection and no rash. Recommended.

I have been seeking out mineral-based sunscreens that are easy to spread and do not leave you with a horrible white film that just doesn't go away. This is the first mineral-based sunscreen I have ever found that goes on smoothly, rubs in well and does not leave you all white and greasy. I LOVE this sunscreen and I love the spray-on version too!

eos-eos

I like this sunscreen overall. There is virtually no whitecast by the time you get it rubbed in. For that reason alone, this is a GREAT option for the price. For me, it feels a little thick going on, and not in a dewy/moisturizing type of way. It actually dries a little tacky in my opinion. I have dry (and sensitive) skin so my skin can usually handle extra moisture but I don't like the tackiness that doesn't sink in or fade all day. For that reason, I think I will look for another sunscreen that will be better for everday wear (probably means more $$) and save this one for wearing out on the boat or for lake days when I don't mind something a little more heavy duty.  Update 4/28/21: I've been using this sunscreen daily now for 6 weeks as the last step in my skincare routine. I ended up not looking for a different product in an effort to save money and not be wasteful. This product has grown on me! My sister recommended that I try a translucent/setting powder over the sunscreen and that significantly helped with the tackiness. For best results, I personally recommend these steps for applying:  1) Using clean hands, rub a nickel-sized amount of sunscreen between your hands. Really rub it around. 2) Gently pat/rub the sunscreen all over your face. 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 with another nickel-sized amount, if desired (I think derms are typically recommending using ~a quarter sized amount for best protection). 4) Wait at least 10 minutes (I prefer 30) before applying powder to let the sunscreen soak in and dry down. Powdered foundation probably would work just as well as translucent powder though I've only tried the latter.  When I follow these steps, I find the tackiness to be much less of an issue and the white cast is virtually nonexistent, at least for my fair skin.  I still give this sunscreen 4 stars because although I'm liking it, I probably will not repurchase after I've used it up.

I have a child who reacts to every sunscreen except this one and the Badger brand unscented. Unlike Badger, this one is much easier to apply and goes on a lot smoother. I don't know for certain what ingredients my child reacts to in most sunscreens, but this one works for her. Two thumbs up!

eos-eos

This is one of the best natural (ie, non-chemical active ingredient) sunscreens I've tried. Clearly the finish won't be as "clear" as chemical-based sunscreens, which would not be fair to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how it does become clearer after you rub it and let it sink in for a minute, and this has the clearest finish I've found out of all the natural sunscreens I've tried. I also like how the finish is really matte and not greasy and how there's no fragrance. Would strongly recommend for sensitive skin.

I developed a rash and eczema from using normal sunscreens. But when I found this product I was so happy because now I don't have allergic reactions to these ingredients and this is an excellent sunscreen

I surf all the time and this stuff works great, even for a long session. My wife originally bought it for our toddler, but now I buy it for myself, too. Doesn’t look too pasty for a zinc-based sunscreen either.

My skin is very fair and I burn easily. This is the first completely non-toxic sunscreen I have found that works this well. Definitely recommend!

I bought this to use in the Caribbean recently and overall I was pleased. I was surprised how easy it was to spread this thinner lotion, compared to other natural brands I've used in the past. That was a real plus for me. I reapplied the sunscreen several times over a few hours of intense sun and several swims and it worked pretty well. I never expect these natural products to completely prevent a slight burn and probably if I'd applied it once more time I would have avoided some skin redness completely.

We like how safe this sunscreen is & it is easy to apply. It is not thick and goopy & rubs in well.

This is great!!! Before I would go out and garden a bit in the morning without sunscreen (in shade/not in direct sun) & my face would get red. When I use this sunscreen, my face doesn't really get red. Feels fine when put on, not all oily and smelly like other brands.

Allergic to the sun and so far, my favorite sunscreen. I still reapply to be safe but it is not too thick and does the job. Definitely recommend!! I use on my toddler as well who prefers this over the thicker sunscreen.

I love this Sunscreen. It lathers on really well and doesnt leave a weird slick/oily feeling on the skin. The fact that it is broad spectrum and has zinc oxide as its active ingredient displays the best parts of this sunscreen. And to top it off it is cruelty free! Really recommend.

This is the best sunscreen. I was a little hesitant because the reviews were mixed but this is great. It blends in super easy, no white cast, even feels moisturizing. I haven’t tested how long it will last really, i’ve only used it on my baby and she’s not in the sun for hours and hours.

I chose this sunscreen because it didn't have any carcinogenic chemicals or chemicals that mimic estrogen. I picked it because study show that zinc or titanium are the two most effect ingredients and least likely to cause long term problems. It's easy to apply and becomes clear rapidly. The best part is that it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out. I would recommend this highly!

This is my new favorite sunscreen at the beach. Works great, goes on well. Does leave a bit of a white film on my skin. Still on the hunt for a true clear zinc that won’t break the bank.
