This product contains methylisothiazolinone (2013 Allergen of the Year). Many people with eczema are allergic to this methylisothiazolinone, and Neutrogena should eliminate it from all their products, particularly ones that say hypoallergenic on the label. It is banned in the EU in leave on skin products like this. I got a terrible rash from methylisothiazolinone (perhaps from this product, hard to know for sure) - it led to being diagnosed via patch testing.

The American Contact Dermatitis Society named methylisothiazoline it's "allergen of the year" in 2013. You'll find it listed about 2/3s the way through the list of ingredients. That seems like an odd choice for a product targeted at people with sensitive skin. It might also help to explain why so many reviews mention skin reactions.

Donot recommend, I just got this today but just after one use I just wash my face and I saw rashes all over my faceüò•I don't know what to do to get rid of this now.This is the first ever product that had reacted on my skin so bad just in one use..Total waste

I started Udine this years ago after a bout with skin cancer left me with 14 stitches down the front of my face. The active ingredient (zinc) doesn't cause cancer (a weird irony with some sunblocks). This was the first one I found that didn't sting when I put it on my face, although I understand from other reviews that some people have gotten reactions to it. It has not increased my incidence of milia, either. The zinc gives the skin a slight white cast, even after it is rubbed in. I use it every morning under my makeup, so that is not a problem. Even when I go without makeup, it is not very noticeable on me, but I am fairly pale. I imagine it might be a problem for darker skin tones when not adding makeup. I am very happy with this product and have had no recurrence of skin cancer in almost 10 years (and I grew up in a time when no one heard of trying to block the sun and we used to put on baby oil and "lay out" to tan faster - it's a wonder I've not had more trouble with cancer).

Sadly, this product was recommended by my dermatologist. Despite the fact that it states it's for sensitive skin--it broke my neck area out in a terrible itchy skin rash. I was miserable and on a trip in Guatemala trekking up and down Mayan ruins where it was hot and humid. When I looked it up on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) app, I understood why because it's very toxic. Really and misleading advertisement for this product.

I have very sensitive skin and have burned almost without regard to any product used. This product has done a good job so far but it disappears very slowly so expect to look like a ghost. If you have a large area to cover, get the extra-large size. I just use it on my face. Other exposed skin gets spray 50+ spf and most often I wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants no matter how hot it is and I never go into water so I do not know how it holds up to that.

I'm allergic to most suntan lotions, possibly due to their fragrance and possibly due to the active ingredient, or both. This is zinc-based and unscented which works for me and is safe for reefs. I easily burn but using this allows me to boat on the tropics without a burn (unless I miss a spot). It lasts a while even in the water. The only down side is that it goes on pretty white. If I care about that, like if going out, I mix in a little foundation which solves the problem.

I used this on our trip to Jamaica, and I got a rash! I've used this product for years with no problems. I compared the ingredient list to an old one, and the inactive ingredients have changed a lot! I'm so sad. This was the only kind I had found that I could use without an allergic reaction. It may work for a lot of people, but not for this "sensitive skin" girl.

eos-eos

For years I've added Neutrogena to my daytime moisturizer and even to my foundation. So glad they're now offering a tinted sunscreen!  I just come from my dermatologist. She said she's never seen such great skin on a 67 year old!! Thank you Neutrogena.

I was using Coppertone Sport for the longest time and I would inevitably get a rash. I always attributed the rash as heat rash. I read the tube directions and it mentioned to stop using it if a rash occurs. It never dawned on me that it was an allergic reaction. So, I got this Neutrogena product and lo and behold, no more rashes! I use the Neutrogena facial sunscreen ‚Äî never gave it any thought to use Neutrogena for the rest of my body. Duh.

My eyes are sensitive to sunscreen even if it‚Äôs not in my eyes but on my face. This one works and has worked summer after summer. I can count on it.

This is by far my favorite sun protection for my face. I've tried so many: cheaper and more expensive. This performs! Plus, it never makes my face burn like so many other lotions I've tried. Yes, it protects really well, even after swimming and sweating.  Although some say it leaves a white film on their face, if you rub it in well, it doesn't show up on light skin. I'm not sure that it's "reef safe", but I'm not seeing any ingredients listed that would disqualify it from that category, so it's probably better than most. Neutrogena should clarify!

eos-eos

No problems with item, use it regularly, works well with my sensitive skin. Weirdness is that it arrived in a plastic grocery style bag, untied, with a sticker on it that had someone else's name??? No address on bag so I can't even verify that it is my order. Amazon says it hasn't been shipped yet. I am really confused, but the date and time are correct on the sticker that doesn't even tell me how it was shipped, so I can't call the shipping company that accepted this item in a plastic bag. Very weird!

I always get rashes from sunblock on my ears and legs and especially skin-folds. No problems with this, it's great. You sure don't look cool wearing it, but it's not as bad as the straight up zinc stuff. It says to store it in a cold spot away from the sun but I've had mine in my car for weeks without losing effectiveness.

eos-eos

Have used Neutrogena Sensitive Skin for quite sometime. This particular sunblock is soft and easy to spread which leaves my skin softer. I use the sunblock year around especially in sunny California. If you seek protection from the weather elements and have sensitive skin Neutrogena Sensitive Skin is an excellent product.

My dermatologist recommended I use this for Melasma because it has certain ingredients. A little goes a long way and one bottle lasted the entire summer. I apply it where my melasma/skin darkening comes out and it results in a more even skin tone. The skin takes in very little UV Ray's when this sunblock is on.  Additionally, my elderly friend uses this sunscreen too because he has sensitive skin. The only downside is that it does result in a white tone on the skin (as many sunblocks do).  I will continue using this product.

I first bought this product when I was living in Florida because I was spending so much time in the sun, either competing in or coaching track. I have dark skin and for years I never used a sunscreen until a dermatologist recommended I start using a sunscreen. I tried a few different brands, but I started breaking out with an itchy rash around the back of my neck, and between my forearms and biceps, and calves and hamstrings. After trying the Nitrogen Sensitive Skin, I figure I must be allergic to sunscreens with Benzoophenones, Oxybenzone, Dioxybenzone, and Avobenzone, because Neutrogena Sensitive Skin contains none of these as an ingredient.  I recently went to a baseball game and sat in direct sunlight for about 3 hours and had no effects from the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen. Like others reviewing this product, I will say it does leave a white haze on your skin if you don't rub it in really well. But for me, I'll take the haze rather than a sunburn or allergic reaction any time.  If you can't find Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, try Neutrogena Pure & Free Baby sunblock lotion, because they are essentially the same product. The only difference is that Neutrogena Pure & Free Baby has added the inactive ingredients Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, and Potassium Sorbate.

I have an extreme sunscreen allergy, typically anything with SPF will swell my face and body up like a balloon. I can wear this with no irritation. I use this on my face and body when we go to the beach, we live in Florida and the sun is extremely intense here so this was a great find!

eos-eos

Finally found this after years of trying. No stinging when I put it on, it doesn't run into my eyes. It is less white and obvious than other mineral sunscreens. Has protected me from skin cancer which I am prone to. It does tend to rinse off quicker in water, so refresh it if you are swimming. No scent and inexpensive.

I have super sensitive skin and bought this for skiing, since skin protection is so important. This sunscreen was perfect! Not oily, didn‚Äôt leave a residue on my skin, and, most importantly, MY SKIN DIDN‚ÄôT BREAK OUT!!!!! In fact, I think my skin was better hydrated, soft, and protected than ever! Will certainly but again!

My son got a rash from regular sunscreen, but this stuff works great! FYI a little goes a LONG way, I was really surprised. I was glad you only need a little, excuse the tube is pretty small. It doesn‚Äôt quite go on clear, there will be a white tint. It‚Äôs also somewhat oily, at least compared to the neutrogena ‚Äúultra-sheer.‚Äù Overall we like it and will buy more

I have sensitive skin and I wanted a sunscreen that didn't smell horrible and didn't break me out. This sunscreen does the job. It's not anything fancy but it works. It has a very faint smell, however, I have noticed a very light white film once I've applied the sunscreen and rubbed it in. Honestly, I don't mind it. If you're as pale as I am no one would ever notice.

eos-eos

Normally i find sunscreen gives that slightly greenish haze but this is silky enough to pit a couple dabs on my face and run in. I put minimal makeup on top i.e mascara, eye liner and lipstick

This is probably the best lotion that I‚Äôve used for my face. Usually I apply the Neutrogena sports lotion and then on my nose I apply this one on top. It forms of frost that completely protects me from the damaging rays of mr sun. this is the best, I recommend it!

eos-eos

This is the only sunscreen that I can smear around my eyes including my eyelid and not have it irritate my eyes when I mildly sweat. Goes on fine. Oh and it does a solid job at protecting my skin from the sun. In the middle of summer, if I'm out ALL DAY, I would apply it twice. But usually I just need to apply it once for a 4 hour round of golf, for instance.

My husband uses this sunscreen on his face when he golfs. Others he tried caused him to break out. This one does not. He‚Äôs very pleased with this product and recommends it!

I‚Äôm allergic to chemical sunscreen. Causes spots and buts that sometimes feel worse than getting actual sunburn. This physical sunscreen is great and offers good protection. You might get a bit whiter and sticky but it does it job.

I live in AZ so sun protection in the summer is a must. I have tried greasy and oily sun blocks before and although they may work well for the body, I needed one that works on the my more sensitive face. I applied evenly to my face and neck, (Note: a small amount goes a long way, I use about a dimes worth). It did seem to linger on my eyebrows so careful when applying. Stayed on after wetting my face.

eos-eos

Even though I had a little bit of a pale skin tone, my face did not burn and it did not clog my pores. Benzones also work well to block sunlight but are not yet studied enough to be safe in my opinion. This stuff should be safe.

eos-eos

So, I am allergic to fragrance and this product IS fragrance free for sure! I wear it often and it has never burned my skin.  The only complaint I have is that it‚Äôs not easy to rub in, especially on hair areas( like beard) and leaves a pinkish color. Def do not want to take a picture looking somewhat pink lol

eos-eos

Finally a suncreen that I don't have to worry about it migrating to my eyes and causing irritation and crying all day. I apply it to my whole eye area/ eyelids everything, with no issues. It goes on smoothly and evenly. It can leave a slight white cast if I apply abit heavy handed, but I'm very light skinned, so no big issue.

I have used many sun protection products on my sensitive skin and I have found all to be adverse when I use it. This product is an outstanding exception. It has no negative impact when I use it and found it to be extremely effective. I highly recommend it.

I need to wear a high spf sunscreen with the only ingredients titanium oxide and zinc oxide. This product checks all the boxes, works well and is easy to apply.

I have fragrance allergies and rosacea, so this is a good sunscreen for me. It does work against me getting sunburned. What I don‚Äôt like is it goes on white and doesn‚Äôt really blend in so you still look a little pale.

Does what it is expose to do without the chemicals that can get into your blood. Don‚Äôt know if it is really a moisturizer as much as a sun block. It doesn‚Äôt dry out my skin.

Great for sun protection. Easy to apply and spread.

Advised to use sunscreen on my face at all times outside but never liked the feel of them. This one feels more like skin lotion, is lightweight, and washes off easily with sensitive skin soap. Provides great protection!

Primary reasons why I purchased this sunscreen: (1) I wanted to avoid avobenzone active ingredient, because when it mixes with the iron in your sweat or hard water, it causes rust-looking orange stains on your clothing. (2) Most tans for me start with a mild burn so I opted for a higher SPF for a recent trip to Costa Rica. (3) This tube is exactly 3 ounces so I bought 2 for a 2-week trip so I could pack them into a carry-on bag.  Result after wearing this product for 11 days: (1) No stains on my clothing. (2) Absolutely no burn on my skin. (3) No issues with TSA. Highly recommend!

I have a hairless Chinese Crested who enjoys baking in the sun. He has clothes but loves to take them off and cook himself. He gets sunburn. I put this on him before he gets his breakfast and it protects him from the bulk of the damage the sun can do to the homely little guy. He still gets spots, but he doesn't turn bright red after his tanning sessions. And it doesn't irritate his sensitive skin. It's a great product fur a bald pup!

Several sunscreens were burning my daughters skin when put on or around her eczema spots. This sunscreen has not done that and I feel safe using it on her.

Other sun blocks have caused dreadful reactions with my eyes. In fact, i had begun to indoor (much as Love swimming!) because my eyes were so bad. Some friends told me I was imagining it. BUT Not a hint of a problems since I have switched. What a difference in my summer .THANK YOU!!

Excellent product, it is a brand I trust and it protects me from the sun better than other products

I like this sunscreen for two reasons. First, it is titanium oxide / zinc oxide based, which is much safer for the environment than standard sunscreens (which can kill coral reefs and other marine life if it gets into water). Second, I have sensitive skin which normally breaks out with prolonged sunscreen use, but that's minimized with this sunscreen. The only down-side is that this type of sunscreen makes your skin look very white, so you have to rub it in really well.

eos-eos

Very nice moisturizer for over 50, sensitive skin, with sunblock. Spreads nice as thin layer. Does not leave 'white' coat. Dries as matte finish. Pleasant under makeup.

I do like it with my moisturizer it feels good moves easier

I love the texture. Does leave a cast but I mix it with a little foundation and it works great.

I like how this doesn't show in your skin pores after it's rubbed in. Seems to work well and doesn't make my skin breakout.

My son is 7 and is sensitive to other sun lotions , sticks or sprays. He will break out in bumps from ordinary sunblocks. This one he does not I can apply it to his face and not worry about him breaking out.

Absolutely the best sunscreen for sensitive skin! My kids have very sensitive skin and their dermatologist suggested this sunscreen and it works perfect! I even use it and I love how it's not greasy like other sunscreens! Gentle enough to apply to your face as well.
