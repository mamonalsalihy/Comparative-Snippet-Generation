Okay…. So this was made in heaven….. Zinc oxide sunscreen normally leave white cast, dries terribly on the skin leaving skin very dry and uncomfortable, stains clothing, etc.  I’ve tried over 20 zinc sunscreens and nothing compares. This is the best hands down. ESTHETICIAN APPROVED. i will be referring to all my clients because it’s for all skin types, doesn’t feel greesy but feels moisturizing, feels amazing on the skin all day long, doesn’t cause my reactive sensitive skin any allergies, and DOES NOT LEAVE A WHITE CAST. BUY IT NOW.

I went to Florida and before I left I put the Love Sun Body face sunscreen on my face and neck and put my makeup over it. The lotion is very silky and rubs in. I did NOT look like a ghost. My face wasn't white. You don't need a lot to cover. My make up went over it flawlessly. It was not greasy and has a nice light scent - it doesn't have that chemical smell like regular sunblock. I even forgot I had it on. When we arrived in Florida it was a beautiful day with a nice breeze. My sister and I enjoyed the back yard for a while and I can tell you this product absolutely works because later on when we went to get ready for dinner, my sister was very sunburn because she didn't put sunblock on and I was not. My face and neck were totally protected. I was so happy I used it that morning!! I would recommend this product to everyone!!

I’ve tested it on my chin for 1 day & I had no irritation, which is a good sign. I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, so I have to be really picky with skin care products, especially when it comes to sunscreens. Most sunscreens either have alcohol, fragrance & other chemical irritants, which I’m trying to avoid, given the fact that I deal with Rosacea as well. This sunscreen is moisturizing & doesn’t leave a shine on my face, which is a huge plus! I agree with the rest of the reviewers here. This might be my holy grail sunscreen that I’ve been looking for this whole time!

I have used Love Sun Body sunscreens for several years including their original formula. I recently purchased their improved SPF 30 sunscreen. It applies noticeably better, absorbing quickly into the skin. And, it seems that Love Sun Body’s SPF 30 formula is exactly what it claims to be. For instance, I play in baseball tournaments in Florida and this product seems to provide protection that is better than some SPF 50’s I have used in the past. For me it is very important that it is all natural. No burning of the eyes with this product. And I feel good that I am applying a natural product under baking sun conditions. Reef friendly also was an important selling point for me.

This is the purest and best sunscreen that I have ever used. Cleanest ingredients, applies easily, feels great on skin, does not leave a white tone on skin & very effective in blocking sun.

I'm a stage 3 melanoma survivor, but I spend a lot of time outside in the sun. I'm looking for effective but safe for the environment mineral sunscreens. Love Sun Body recently changed their formula to make it more sheer and I agree it is better than the first version. While it is still thick enough to make me feel confident in the sun, there is no white residue after rubbing it in.

I live in Florida and have tried every sunscreen, it seems. I am very concerned about using one that has 100% natural ingredients. I am impressed with the fact that Love Sun Body has an Ecocert – Cosmos Natural certification. It is sheer, lightweight but effective and I love all of the products they offer, including for my niece's baby! I will be ordering more - this is now my go-to sunscreen! I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to, as it is so important what we put on our bodies!

Loved how silky smooth it went on and it simply went on very easy and wasn’t whitening. My skin feels great after I apply it especially when I go outside all day in the sun on a sunny day. My skin feels refreshed and moisturized after each application! Thx for making this stuff!

This product is great! It goes on sheer, is the perfect size for traveling, and leaves me looking glowing. It also doesn’t feel oily like many other products I’ve used. 10/10!

I really like this product, sets into skin easily and can put make up on after without feeling like it’s too many layers or sticky.

Love the brand philosophy; chemical free, eco-friendly and reef safe sunscreen! Smells better than most. The improved lotion is not thick, goes on smoothly and does not leave a white cast. Gives full coverage. We love it so much we have Love Sun Body lotions in a basket at our beach house for everyone to use.

I had tried the previous version of this face cream… This one is much better. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs into my skin. I even use it at night as a moisturizer before going to bed after washing my face. I like that the ingredients are all natural.

Love the idea that I can use this on my face every day for protection and moisturizing. It is a safe product. which is a priority for me. This meets all my needs.

I am a medical doctor in the field of Dermatopathology and a skin cancer specialist. This 'sunblock' exceeds the FDA requirement to block the cancer causing UV rays. AND this product dries in seconds and doesn’t leave you with a chalky white appearance.  I recommend LOVE SUN BODY to all my patients and colleagues. I use it daily.  If I use it, it's the best.
