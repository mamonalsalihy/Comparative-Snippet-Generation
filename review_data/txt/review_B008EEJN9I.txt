takes a few extra rub downs than the more expensive brands before it goes clear into your skin, but it does spread easy. It is water proof however you really must wait 15 minutes after applications for it to sink into your skin. I swim a ton in an outdoor pool so I bought this over the smaller over the counter ones since over the course of a summer I could easily spend more 2 times the amount that this huge jug cost me. Over all i would recommend for anyone wanting to avoid skin cancer/skin burns who is frequently outdoors. SPF30 is more than enough for anyone, SPF is just a marketing tactic they use to make you send more. SPF 30 = 97% of radiation is blockerd SPF50 = 98 % is blocked. It is an minimal increase that is negligible for real world use. This is why they use the SPF number instead (to make you buy the higher priced higher number when in reality it makes almost no difference).

Bought it for a summer in the garden. Seems to be going well. Everybody loves the smell, though it is supposedly unscented. It rubs out nicely and hangs in there on a sunny afternoon. It has a nice creamy feel. I keep it in a spot on the shelf next to the kitchen door out to the garden. Just smear it on as you head out.

This sunscreen lotion goes on very easily without leaving white streaks. I use this while at home to put a base layer of sun screen on myself and kids before getting swimsuits on and going to the beach. The pump makes getting the sunscreen out very easy, especially with greasy hands. Once I finish this gallon on sunscreen, I will definitely buy another!

great quality. I wish they had disclosed the ingredients in the description. it has parabens and popelyne glycol... but the sunscreen absorbs great and it has a great non greasy feel to it.

purchased the guys who work outdoors on a regular basis had access to sun screen - the pump makes it more hygenic for multiple person use.

Great product. The product really is fragrance-free! I have to use sunscreen year 'round and did not want to smell like coconut all year. This sunscreen makes that possible. This sunscreen is not greasy at all and blends into the skin very quickly. Buy with confidence.

Wow, what a great product. I love the big quantity. We are a family of 6. My extending family is coming to California from the east and it will be perfect. Easy pump. Works great...no burns so far. I am afraid to take it out to the beach. Sure it will be taken. Haha.

This was an incredibly good value on this brand of sunscreen. I've seen it priced at twice and three times this much money.

I bought this product for my high school football players and it is the best sunscreen on the market. You only have to apply it once to get all day protection and the fact that it has Zinc Oxide in the product makes it so that my players won't have to constantly reapply and it is good for their skin
