Oh snap this sunscreen is the best! I've been buying it in stores for years, but suddenly, there was no Aussie Gold to be found one day. Where was I going to get my sweet smelling, sun protecting, skin browning, Australian Gold in a bottle? BOOM! Amazon to the rescue. I jumped around like a Kangaroo when I saw this was available. Once again, my skin would be burn free, I'd smell of pure decadence, and look like I'd spent my entire life shirtless in the Outback serenading Koala's with my didgeridoo. Thank you Amazon, but more importantly thank you Australian Gold!

Great stuff buy it every year. I burn very easily I'm pale skin. However if I do get a little Sun I put this on and I never feel the pain of sunburn. FYI to for some reason mosquitoes don't like the smell of it but it smells wonderful.

This is my favorite to use. I've been using this for several years. I rarely get a sunburn. I'm fair skinned and burn easily. This protects me even in the Florida sun on the beach when I'm on vacation. I love the smell. People have actually complimented my fragrance too.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND SKIN ON THIS PRODUCT! IT'S A SCAM!  Everything was off about this product! I have at home a original one that I bought from a drugstore, I've been using it for over 3 years and it's my favorite sunscreen/bronzer to use. Lately has been hard to find it at drugstores near me, so I was very excited when I found this product on Amazon.  Well, first of, one of the caps got here broken and there was nothing I could do to make it work, I figured I'd just substitute with a old one I had here with me, but before that, I decided to try one the other one that wasn't broken, it felt very off, it was very liquidy and not creamy at all, very oily on the skin and the smell was definitely not the same and I definitely know the difference cause I had just enough of my almost empty bottle to put in half of my body and on the other half I used the new one, even my husband was able to notice all of those differences. Besides all that, I still decided to give it a try, on that day I went to a baseball game at 1pm on a very hot summer day. When I got home the side of my body that I had put on the new sunscreen on, was itchy, not due to the product itself but for the lack of sun protection, the same happens to me when I go out in the sun without sunscreen. So basically I had very good protection on my right side but not on the left. I was very disappointed! Of course after that I didn't even wanna try the product on the other bottle and returned them both!  This product is definitely a fake, I couldn't help but think that they either put a different product on the bottle or watered down and added some oily stuff to make more batches of it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND SKIN ON THIS PRODUCT! IT'S A SCAM!

I am very fair skinned (my family is Welch, red heads with pale skin and pink undertones). I burn and peel without a 45+ spf. It’s literally impossible for me to get a tan. I laid out for an hour yesterday and TAN LINES!!!!!!

eos-eos

I exclusively use this brand for sun lotion because I love the smell of it. It doesn’t smell like sunscreen, even my boyfriend likes the smell so it’s not anything girly it just smells nice and not like your tropical sunscreen! It does have instant tanner so don’t wear a white bathing suit with it or just be very careful not getting it on the swim suit, but it’s great for a pale girl like me. It gives me a little tan while making sure to keep the harmful UV rays from damaging my skin. My mum actually got me into this type with the instant bronzer because as a teenager all I wanted to do was be tan even though it is terrible for your skin and I wouldn’t wear sunscreen so I could get more tan. Now I have the best of both worlds! Also I can’t find this brand at 50 spf with the instant tanner in any of my local stores so being able to get it on amazon is amazing.

I love this brand of sunscreen for it's smell. I've been using the SPF 30 with bronzer but have found I need to increase the SPF for my fair skin. This is a nice alternative. It smells great, the spray gel is easy to apply and it seems to hold up well to salt water :)

I have never liked a sunscreen. Ever. They’ve all left me feeling slimy, hot, sweaty, and smelly (most with a starchy white cast). Because of this, I have unfortunately never worn it anywhere close to often enough. Then I stumbled onto this stuff at my mom’s house and fell in love.  The texture of this sunscreen is lightweight and moisturizing, and it does not make me feel slimy or hot, etc. That is amazing.  It does make me a bit shiny, don’t expect any miracles from the spray nozzle, and the smell is pretty tropical (but also pretty pleasant). Even with these very minor side notes, I will recommend this to anyone who will listen.

I stumbled on this product while shopping for our recent trip to Cabo. First, let me say this sunscreen smells absolutely FANTASTIC! I normally use a 30 spf and I found this product to do a great job protecting me from any sunburning. It doesn't feel greasy at all and absorbs easily leaving my skin looking and feeling great! The thing I really like about it is that while they call it a "bronzer" it doesn't give you a strange "fake tan" look at all, it just kind of gives my skin a subtle glow. As you can see in my photo, the product just has a slightly creamy-tan color to it which I love! I can't stand suntan lotions that leave my skin looking white and pastey...This one is my new favorite and I recommend trying it!

I wear sunscreen everyday to keep wrinkles at bay. The smell of this product is wonderful. It doubles as a fragrance and a sunscreen. I have not had a chance to use during warm weather and do wonder if the bronzing will rub off when sweating. The bronzer is not very dark in my opinion. Hopefully it wont be an issue. It made my face appear greasy but I use another product for my face.

I love this product and have since I found it years ago. Gentle bronzer mixed with uv protection and a great mild fragrance. However this year in an attempt to be environmentally conscious and kind to our ocean reefs they have reformulated this product. I am glad they have done this but it is a little different now. You will #1 fragrance. The gentle orange fragrance is gone. The spray pump is often less effective and the product doesn't atomize as well and is a more direct spray/stream that can be a bit wild at times. Still love the product and glad they have removed reef damaging chemicals so I can continue using it. This company has by far the best price and consistent in delivery. Support them!

I have used this sunscreen for a year when I go to the beach (almost every weekend) and I love that I never get a sunburn and always get a nice tan. I also try to stay under the shade while sitting, and that may also help with no getting a sunburn. But I also walk and swim and the tan I get is a golden beautiful color, I like that it tints my skin a bit so I don't look too white... but be careful because it may also tint your bathing suit

eos-eos

I would wear this for the smell alone. Its down right delicious. The bonus is the SPF. I'm pretty dark and it kind of gives me this glowiness and I nevvveerrr get burned. My boyfriend is a pasty white boy and he gets this really nice sort of even bronzing in the sun but no freckles or burns whenever he puts this on. We both love it and I've been using it as a present for people because no one I know ever knew of this brand and everyone needs sunscreen and it smells soooo yummy and works so well so its like a total winner.

eos-eos

The pump is a nice touch but the lotion shoots out so be careful or it gets all over. I live in lower Alabama where the bugs are God awful. I purchased this on a recommendation that not only is it great sun screen protection but it’s also a great mosquito and yellow fly repellent. Before I go out I put on AG and not only am I protected from the sun but I am no longer bothered my mosquitoes and yellow fly. This stuff is truly amazing!

eos-eos

Fair skin and no desire to sunbathe, this suntan gel spray works wonders on my pale skin. It protects me from sunburn AND gives my skin a healthy warmer glow.  This is not like the stuff that turns your hands yellow and smells bad. It is a convenient spray that never clogs (I turn the sprayer head to "lock" each time). And it's a very light beige color with a pleasant fragrance - not the tell-tale fake-tan look or smell! I DO wash my hands immediately after applying so that I don't have to worry about getting it on my clothes. I did learn that you must let it dry (5 minutes tops) before putting on clothes, as I found it on the inside leg edges of my crop pants.

No streaking! Easy to apply. I am very fair and have 58 year old female skin...dry, thin, age spots. So, when I use self-tanners my skin appears extra crispy dry! Not so with this product. It goes on evenly-doesn't stain ankles, knees, toes...Smooths on like lotion. Only drawbacks: Color is for the very fair skinned. Smells like sunscreen-but it is a nice scent. I have not used it for sun protection so I was unable to rate that. Additionally, I have not used it at the beach, swimming pool, etc. so I do not know how well it stays on after a day in the sun/water.

eos-eos

Really like this sunblock! I spend 20 hours or more a weekend outside cutting grass and this sunblock keeps me from burning. It seems to be helping my skin tan as well! The most favorite part is this sunblock is actually NOT GREASY! I've used other sunblocks that advertised not being greasy but they still were. I really like this sunblock and the tanning enhancement. I'll for sure be ordering more. The price is fair as well!

eos-eos

This is the only sunscreen I use! Period. I’ve used this for at least 10 years and it hasn’t failed me yet! I have fair-ish skin with freckles. I apply my sunscreen before I get dressed so it has plenty of time to absorb. I might reapply mid day if I’m out all day. And if I feel my skin getting too hot, I seek shade. This strategy wins every time. I’ll eventually tan this way and I will not burn. I even tested it in the Caribbean! It smells fabulous and goes on smooth and evenly. And it gives a nice glow to my tan. Good luck out there!

eos-eos

I use this every day and the color is just right. As I have had skin cancer I must cover myself in sunscreen daily from head to toe. This goes on smoothly and gives a nice glow with good SPF. Not pasty white like others with this high SPF.

eos-eos

Great stuff

eos-eos

This product feels more like a luxurious moisturizer. It goes on smoothly as a creamy liquid and absorbs quickly. The scent is fabulous, thnk a pineapple-y pina colada and the shimmer from the bronzer, as well as the tint are very subtle, no glitter. Please note a bronzer is differnt from a self tanner so the shimmer only lasts until you wash it off. I am very satisfied with the quality

eos-eos

Love this product Australian gold is the only way to know. It enhances your tan while sun bathing. Plus gives you the protection you need. However I do not wear this with a white bathing suit because it will stain it. This product is amazing and smells great. I still give it five stars

eos-eos

I use this on my face and hands daily. It smells soooo good. It's really a nostalgic scent for me. Reminds me of my early twenties when I had time to have fun in the summer. It leaves my skin soft and surprisingly not greasy. The price is unbeatable. The spray nozzle works great.

I am very fair skinned and do not tan well. I burn easily. This gives me a nice tan, great sun protection and smells good too.

eos-eos

Highly recommend this product. The SPF standard holds true and the consistency of the lotion is amazing. Goes on very good. It’s not oily or creamy. No odd smells. Hands down the best tanning/Sun protection in one. Have already bought another bottle as a back up.

We winter in Florida so we can spend hours outdoors and go to the beach frequently. We’ve used other brands (Coppertone, Bananaboat, Neutrogena, several store brands, etc.) until we tried Australian Gold Extreme Sport. Easy to apply, covers well, dries quickly, and is truly swear and water resistant.

eos-eos

I go to the beach on weekends, early in the morning, and stay to around 10 - 11 am. I wear this sunscreen before I leave the house. Not only is the tan even and great color, but my skin is shiny and a lot less dry. I would recommend this product to everyone that wants to get a tan. Not sure I would use it for longer use unless you reapply. It smells great without being over the top smelly.

eos-eos

I have used Australian Gold products for several years. Love their products and this was no exception. Budget friendly, great texture and smell. The locking cap is pretty great for preventing spills in your bag as well. ☺️ Exactly as expected. Definetly recommend.

Photo on Amazon is incorrect as it shows the old bottle. The packaging and formula are different. I just hope it works at least at good as the old formula. I have not fully tested it. See photos.

eos-eos

By far the best suntan lotion - I purchased the 30, 15 and 8 in the gel formula. Goes on smooth, easy to blend and eliminates burning when using the right protection at the right time.. i.e. 30 when you're first exposed to the sun and then lowering protection once you have a base tan. Quick order/delivery helps too.

eos-eos

This is my favorite tanning/sunscreen lotion. It gives you an immediate bronze look before you even lay out. I apply every hour I am outside just to make sure I do not burn. I have never burned and have always had a nice tan when using this. It smells awesome as well! The only reason I purchased it through Amazon was because I searched everywhere I usually buy it, (Walmart, Giant, Target) and couldnt find it. You know when you search online to buy a product, its a good one!

eos-eos

For me I have extremely fair skin and unable to be outside for long periods of time, do to severe sunburns. This lotion gives me the perfect combination of protection and a bronze/tan look on my skin without the sunburn. Keep in mind you have to reapply every 80 minutes if you are in a pool or ocean.

eos-eos

I use this product daily. I love the light scent. It spreads evenly and does provide me with good sun protection. I do find that like all sunscreens, I do reapply it several times a day. I like that it give my skin a very subtle sheen. The sprayer can get clogged so I recommend shaking the bottle daily. I find that spritzing it on my hands and then spreading the product to get a more even coverage works better than spraying it directly onto my arms.

eos-eos

This is one of those products you don't want to write a review for because you love it so much. I tell people I collect sunscreen and sunglasses. I have a lot of sunscreen. This is by far my favorite for my arms, legs and chest daily. It doesn't smell like sunscreen, has no whitecast, and has protected me from the harsh Arizona sun. I think it smells like a dreamsicle, but only when you put it on. It's the most in sunscreen sunscreen I've found.

eos-eos

This product works great for sun protection. I apply it and can stay in the sun for hours and not get burned. It's also helps with a nice dark bronze tan. Excellent skin protection with keeping out harmful rays 😎

It spreads very easily and absorbs quickly. Non-greasy. Doesn't give too much color so that it looks fake. I use it daily and will definitely order again.

The spray bottle makes this sunscreen easy to apply and the bronzer ensures you'll apply evenly (and look tan doing so). It's a thicker formulation, like a gel or cream, but it spreads and blends easily over your skin. I personally prefer a more coconut-y smell with sunscreen, but my fiance did like the scent, and most importantly, it's effective against sunburn. I normally tan easily and 50 worked well on me in the Caribbean summer sun, and it worked well for my fiance who is more fair. I would purchase this sunscreen again.

eos-eos

I enjoy tanning myself, I have tried many products over the years and I found this one worked very well with my fair skin. It has a moisturizing effect and just enough coverage that I don't burn. I will be reordering again.

This is my go to product for a great tan. Smells great, easy to apply, and adds some color. Especially good for the beginning of the season. I buy the 15 and 30 spf

It’s long time I use it and it is very effective in protecting from sun burns ( now even more with 50 SPF) non sticky, makes you tanned faster, good scent, affordable price, what else!

Classic Australian gold smell! Love it! Nice bronze and good protection. Only complaint is the spraying mechanism. It sprays more of a straight line rather than a "shower" type spray so you really have to spread it with your hands

eos-eos

Always use Australian Gold Sunscreen around our pool. You will find multiple SPF at my home for my family and guests. Great value and it smells wonderful. I do not use this product when i go to the beach and intend on diving as it does have some chemicals that will harm our aquatic life and coral reefs but we use these products for our pool and every pool we go to whether on vacation or what not. Will always buy!

eos-eos

Just like all the other Australian Gold products, this one also didn't let me down. The outdoor spray gel has great coverage, protection and scent. I will purchase it again.

I bought the SPF 4 by accident but I was SHOCKED by it working better than most SPF 100 sunscreens I’ve used. I am very very pale and have a very red undertone therefore I burn like no other. I tried out this sunscreen today and sat outside in direct sunlight for two hours and didn’t get any burn! I did miss a spot right above and below my bikini top and they are very burned. And that is how I know this sunscreen is a life saver!! Most sunscreens would still leave me burnt after 30 minutes. So worth it!!!!

eos-eos

I have tried many sunscreens. I hate the feel of oily, goopy, thick creams and the sprays seem to be ineffective and I usually burn with them. I applied this gel spray ONCE to my very fair, pasty body and then went swimming in a quarry for 2 hours. I didn't get burned at all and even was complimented on the scent! It soaks in well and doesn't leave a film or a goopy feeling.

eos-eos

I have been using Australian Gold 30 with bronzer for at least 5 years. I live in a warm climate and apply sunscreen every day. I switched to the #50 for more protection. It has a slightly different smell. I prefer the smell of the #30, though I want the sun protection of the #50. The bronze is a nice added touch.

Australlian Gold is my favorite sunscreen... Great smell. Protects against sunburn but I will get a tan with out the burn.

Very nice sun protection. Spreads easily. Smells very good. The only slight problem I've had with it is the sprayer doesn't always work that well. It is not clogged. It seems like a production defect because it doesn't fit exactly right. Overall a good product.

This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. I’m pale Irish and burn easily, and I haven’t burnt wearing this all summer and the bronzing makes me look like I have a tan. It doesn’t rub off, doesn’t stain, doesn’t smell like fake tanner ... it’s wonderful! Highly recommend!!
