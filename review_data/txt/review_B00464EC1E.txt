I was introduced to the Elta products many years ago at my dermatologist's. I am a woman of a certain age with very good skin. I plan to keep it that way. After reading the reviews stating the Amazon product is different than the dermatologist products, I compare the two I have. I didn't see, smell or feel any difference. My skin has not experienced any breakouts. The price is definitely different. I can only say I will purchase here again and save a bit of money.

I am SO disappointed. I bought this and used until I realized that it contains Octinoxate which is toxic for the coral reef. Hawaii has banned the sale of sunscreen with this toxic chemical in it to protect the environment. I am disappointed that my favorite sunscreen uses ingredients that hurt the environment

This company deserves to be sued. After getting burned horribly, with blisters, I then knew why my 2 year old daughters skin was breaking into a serious rash. This product. Looking in to what can legally be done for recourse. I am shocked this is an “Amazons Choice”. I will be taking this to a lab to see what is in it to find out what can be done for legal recourse. For the others who had similar experiences, a class action suit seems to be in order.

This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist after she removed a melanoma. It contains zinc oxide--that white stuff that lifegueards put on their noses and ear tops. This product disappears on my face and doesn't look chalky. I like to spend time outdoors and feel safe with this protective layer. This is pricey, but worth it--just wish I could buy it in larger quantities..

This product was suggested by my dermatologist and it is great. I typically wear the tinted version, but bought this by mistake, but still kept it for other areas than my face. A little goes a long way and surprisingly the small bottle lasts a long time. It does not burn the eyes when sweating which is a big concern for the males in my life. I bought this also for my son who is a red-head and works construction and it protects him. I have also tried the sport waterproof tube and it works great as well. I highly recommend Elta products. They may be a bit pricey, but my skin is worth it...and as I said, a little goes a long way.

This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. OK, I'll give it a try, as the doctor recommended it. Getting older, as some of you know, you don't have as much moisture in your skin, so it's a must. Living in a higher elevation state, ok, Colorado, I need the sun screen as well. This product goes on smoothly, and does not leave an oily film or feel on your skin. My skin just soaks it up. Yes, the price is a little expensive, but it's so worth it. I have sensitive skin, and this product does not bother me at all. I have thought of purchasing other products, which I have through the years, but now that I have tried this one, I'm never going to other products again.

Update: This sunscreen breaks me out! I will stop using this.  I needed a moisturizer and sunscreen in one combo and this item is great! This does not have a strange smell like normal sunscreens and this goes great under my make up. This formula doesn't feel sticky or make my make up separate. This sunscreen literally just feels like a moisturizer, not sure if that's a good thing or not. I don't really like the pump but it's not too big of a big deal. If this helped, please give this review a thumbs up

Buyer Beware!!! I bought this from my dermatologist and loved it. The container I bought on Amazon was not expired but smells rancid. This could have been a bulk shipment left in a storage facility too long or a manufacturer's defect in production. Obviously, I don't know why it smells so bad and yet is marked as still useable. No matter, it is useless unless you like smelling like Old Kitchen Grease all day. Since it wasn't expired I didn't think to test it when I purchased it. It sat in my bathroom cabinet for 3 weeks until my other container was emptied. By the time I tried to get a refund, the return period was over.

Which basically means that NO ONE here complaining of dry skin can compare to my everyday! Basically, aldosterone is the hormone that tells the human body to keep hold of fluids to stay hydrated, to excrete water through urine, and whether to absorb necessary salt from the food in your intestines or whether to just go ahead and leave the salt to be excreted. However, since I do not produce aldosterone, my body just instantly excretes ALL of my fluids and never absorbs any salt from my diet. The salt is particularly problematic because every single cell in your body requires salt for each and every biological process. In fact, the heart muscles cannot beat without salt and depend on a sodium channel pathway to continue to move the blood flow properly. So, basically I am extremely dehydrated ALL of the time and due to this continuous dehydrated state, I have THE WORLD'S DRYEST skin! When I say I have tried EVERY product, I have tried EVERY product. Most recently, I tried the L'oreal hydra genius for extremely dry skin that over 1,200 people rated 5 stars. That stuff might as well have been water because it literally just dried on my face like water and did absolutely NOTHING! After that, a friend of mine kept telling me to try the Cerave facial moisturizer and I finally did because I have their skin ointments and the skin ointments work. My friend kept going on and on about how amazing this Cerave face moisturizer was and how she kept annoying her mom to try it and finally her mom tried it and her mom was shocked by how great it was. I tried it and honestly I'm not seeing how that Cerave face moisturizer is ANY different from any other off brand generic face moisturizer you can buy at walmart. Like it literally was no different than grabbing the equate face moisturizer at walmart. And I get really irritated when over 1,000 give a basic level moisturizer rave reviews because I'm over here at deathcon 1 with the dry skin situation and I need the best there is to offer! I don't have time to waste on whatever junk product neutrogena is advertising the heck out of this month even though they know its nothing better than the other products they're put out. Again, I researched and read the reviews and finally decided to try this moisturizer and i'm SOOOO glad I did.  Also side note: if you do not have serious legit medical skin issues, can you take your whiny but over to neutrogena and stop leaving pointless reviews about how it made your skin oily/breakout??? IF YOU DON'T HAVE LEGIT SKIN MEDICAL ISSUES, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU AND YOUR REVIEW KEEPS SOMEONE WITH LEGIT MEDICAL SKIN ISSUES FROM READING A HELPFUL REVIEW FROM SOMEONE RELEVANT!!!!  Anyways, this product will effectively keep your face moisturized. It may seem slightly too dry the first few days, but your skin will adjust and during that time, I suggest you do what I did and CAKE IT ON!!!! For example, I remember the second day I used it, I literally smeared SOOOO much of the stuff ALL over my face and literally within 5 minutes my face felt like I had never applied any moisturizer to it, so I caked it back on again! lol It will be like this for a few days, and then you'll slowly start needing less and less. Also note, that this is JUST a moisturizer. It doesn't have any healing properties or anything. On my face, the skin is literally so dry that scratching my face will sometimes make my face feel sunburned and it will just feel like I have a sunburn when I don't, the skin is just dry and irritated. This moisturizer won't do anything to relieve the burning feeling or instantly soothe your symptoms. You just have to put the moisturizer on and keep putting it on until your skin is finally hydrated enough to stop experiencing that burning sensation. I sort of expected to put this stuff on and thought my burning would instantly go away and then I realized oh its just moisturizer, it doesn't have anything but moisturizer in it.

I have normal to dry skin with some rosacea, sensitivity and eczema. I can't use the UV Clear formula because it has lactic acid and I don't want to even think about what it would do to my skin long term. UV Daily is perfect. I've using it for a few months and have experienced absolutely no sensitivity. It is also very moisturizing without being greasy or heavy. A very elegant formula - I only use it for my face as it only lasts one month per bottle. It has a slight, I mean slight white cast. If you have light skin, it shouldn't matter unless you plan on handling black clothing. Let it dry on your skin first before you do that.

Melanoma issues run in my family, so I use an SPF daily. Personal research and my wife's dermatologist make EltaMD a no-brainer, but which of the many formulas works best is up to you. My wife uses the unscented clear UV with spf 46, which she loves, but she already uses a moisturizer with her makeup.  I prefer a moisturizer for my face, even with a beard or stubble, and spf 40 is good for me. Try it. It's not as expensive as the trendy brands. Keep it in your shopping cart and when it goes on sale, get two. You're welcome.

I bought this sunscreen on the recommendation of Dr. Dray, a dermatologist who has a YouTube channel I follow. Of particular note is the product moisturizing capability in addition to great sunscreen protection. I'm 64 and have dry skin, and was finding it hard to get my hands on a sunscreen that also wears well under makeup. EltaMD UV Daily Facial Sunscreen is definitely an answer to my various skin care needs. In addition, it has a little dispensing pump, which makes it easy to use. Will definitely buy again.

Love this stuff! The only sunscreen that’s been easy enough, non-smelly enough, and fine on sensitive skin so that I wear it daily. Highly recommend. This is my second bottle and won’t be my last. I tried the tinted version but actually like the clear the best (I have very fair skin and products easily look orange on me).

eos-eos

I’m a guy and have used this stuff almost daily for the past year. It has absolutely rocked my world- makes me look years younger, keeps the acne and pimples at bay, firms/evens out your skin, and most importantly protects from sun damage.  I have very fair skin- I don’t tan, I burn and I’ve sustained a lot of now-revealed damage to my face over the years by not using this product sooner and every day. Yes, it a bit pricey. But absolutely worth every penny.

Es muy bueno, vivo en Miami y he probado muchos bloqueadores porque mi piel es muy clara y mi cara se mancha muy rápido si no tengo protección. Cuando se absorbe en la piel la deja hidratada y no deja la piel blanca, se ha vuelto mi preferido ya he comprado dos y voy por el tercero.

I have been using this for close to two years now ever since I saw this product listed in a very reputable news publication that was detailing the top sunscreens. A little bit goes a long way and although I wish the containers was larger, I'm still happy with it and the protection it gives, although i usually still wear a hat when out walking on a sunny day.

eos-eos

I purchased EltaMD from my dermatologist. My bottle was running low so I ordered this product from Amazon. It was slightly cheaper & didn’t have to make a trip to the Dr. I have a family history of skin cancer, so I was afraid to trust the amazon product with my fair skin. It smells a little different, I tried to return it, (it said “ships & fulfilled by Amazon). I could Not return it, “this item came from a third party and can not be returned” 😡

Wow! I have super sensitive skin prone to allergic break outs from dust. My doctor prescibed clindamycin and retin a to fade the scars left behind. Retin A makes your skin super dry and flaky esp in the beginning but also irritates it. This caused other lotions to actually feel like they were burning when applied. Not this! My skin felt super dry and flaky and I put this on. About 80% of the dryness was gone and my skin felt smooth and soothed immediately. I used a face lotion with allantoin before and highly reccomend it as an ingredient for sensitive skin. And the 40 spf is a definite plus as retin a leaces you more susceptable to sunvurn. Great product and a little goes a long way.

Originally purchased from dermatologist and have bought on Amazon ever since  Live in Florida and bike, golf, tennis and boat daily so protection from sun is important

I love this sunscreen/ moisturizer! I currently use cetaphil gentle skin cleanser or clinique (mild ) for face wash / simple 12 hr to moisture ( i like to moisturize twice) trentinoin 0.025% at night and pixi glow 5% glycolic acid toner in the am( i do this on the days i dont apply trentinoin). This product works well with my routine my skin really loves this product and i will definitely purchase again. My skin type is non acne prone sensitive combo

I have crazy sensitive skin but the small amount in my daytime moisturizer is not enough protection for me. I got this as I have started walking and needed to protect my very fair skin. Most products break me out and since I was needing something so often, I wanted a higher quality that I previously used.

eos-eos

I live in Florida and use sunscreen every day! This goes on smooth as silk and doesn't make me look like a ghost. Sometimes I mix it with a bit of my tinted make-up if I want a little more coverage. I'm on my 2nd pump and will definitely order again. (Plus my dermatologist approves my choice.)

eos-eos

This is literally the best face sunscreen ever. I am a pretty cheap person, and the price tag is worth it. The application feeling is perfect, it doesn’t pill under makeup, doesn’t cause acne, and is just overall the best sunscreen I have ever used.

Excellent product. Easy to apply, doesn't leave greasy feeling. Yesterday i had a little left over on my hands after applying to my face so i rubbed on one shoulder. After being outside in the sun in a tank top, next morning i noticed the shoulder where I applied the cream is white while my other shoulder is bright red. I'll be ordering body sun screen from the company now.

Had extremely sensitive skin from accutane. This item did not irritate my skin, did well undet makeup, no white cast, absorbs quickly, no odor, and acts as a decent moisturizer. Its definitely not for deep moisturizing but perfect for day makeup moisturizer

I have been using this EltaMD UV Daily Face Sunscreen Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid SPF 40 and would highly recommend this products because I have been using this products for about 5-6 years and it does not disappoint. This moisturizer is light not heavy at all perfect for sensitive and/or dehydrated face. My skin type is dehydrated so when I found this product I also needed a SPF with my moisturizer (I am lazy to apply so many products) so this was a great choice for me. During summer time I do noticed the difference and keeps it hydrated no need to reapply.

This moisturizer, Elta MD UV Facial Broad-Spectrum Moisturizer with sunscreen, was recommended by my dermatologist to use along with my Tretinoin cream for fine lines, etc... I use it during the day as I need a combination of moisturizer and sunscreen while using the Tretinoin cream. I find it goes on very easily and absorbs nicely. It makes my skin feel soft and protected. If you are using a prescription Tretinoin cream as I am you know there is a time when you feel like you have a sunburn, when that happens I use Elta MD Intense Moisturizer at night which is made for those using prescriptions or who have had recent procedures. I use that at night and it works like a charm. So the combination of Elta products works great for me. Just make sure you buy them through Amazon directly and not a third party to make sure you get the real thing.

eos-eos

I like this product during the cooler months when I am not outside very much. It is only 40 SPF. I have fair skin so I need a higher SPF during the year when I am outside more.  I like the product but I have had problems receiving my orders on time and receiving them at all. Thank goodness for Amazon's good business practices taking care of my problems receiving this product.

I love this because I sweat a lot with sun screens, but this one is perfect. It gives me the perfect protection, light to wear, moiturize, not leave the skin greasy. And I can use together with serum, moisture and the end this sunscreen, and leave me the face ready to wear make up. Moreover, it not have odor, so it is perfect because this not activate my migrain. I am using it for 1 year.

My Dr's office charges $20 more for this. I have tried all the over the counter products but they always felt greasy or didn't protect that well from the sun. This product is great! This product leaves my skin feeling soft and non greasy. Even after 10 hours at work my skin still feels great. Works well under makeup also. I am in the sun a lot and Elta MD protects my skin better than anything else. The tinted is also great for days you don't feel like wearing makeup. Tossed all my other products. Lasts me several months.

Love this stuff. Been using the tinted one for many years but got sick of it being the wrong tone for me as I’m quite fair and the tint is too dark. Finally got this one and it’s perfect, if I wore makeup it wouldn’t be noticeable underneath, it’s so thin and absorbs quickly.

I am fair complected and have had numerous pre-cancers frozen from my face annually. I have also had two biopsy's that were positive. My Doctor recommended EltaMD sunscreen as the best he's used. It is not greasy, works into the skin quickly and provides hours of protection. I spend long days flyfishing in direct sunlight and so far have not had any burns but you must reapply if you happen to wash it off accidentally. I usually use it twice during a 10hr day on the water.

eos-eos

I’ve used this product for over 10 years and I love it! I use this every single day before I apply my makeup and even when I go natural. I also ran a half marathon and marathon in this sunscreen and didn’t get a burn. I am porcelain skin and prone to acne and this doesn’t bother my skin!

eos-eos

I wear this daily unless I’m going to be sweating profusely. It stings a little if it sweats into your eyes, or if you rub your eyes after applying. I recommend washing it off your fingers before going about your morning. It’s nice and light, takes very little for full coverage, and has absolutely no impact on my makeup application. This is my 3rd bottle, and I haven’t found any product I like better.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is the best. It is a little white when you first put it on, but it disappears after a few minutes. It does not smell or sting your eyes. It does not give you that odd taste in your mouth so many sunscreens do. It doesn’t ball up, or impact my makeup (which is minimal) at all. It is like putting on a moisturizer. This is a sunscreen that is easy to use - so I do!

Update: Wanted to add that this small bottle seems expensive for the size but it really does last forever and I use it every day and sometimes at night.  I have rosacea and still break out like a teenager at the age of 41. I was putting desitin on my skin at night to calm down my acne and using sunblock every day with a lot of zinc as well. But zinc is a pain because it is sooo white, and it leaves your face looking so shiny. Well my doc told me about this. I was a little shocked by the price but I tell ya, I love this stuff!! It does not burn my face at all or leave it white or shiny. In fact its so nice you can put makeup on right over it. My skin is even way clearer. Worth every penny!! Just bought my second bottle. :)

I don't like heavy creams or makeup. This sunscreen is light and goes on well. No white leftover mess like other sunscreens. Would recommend. Have used for several years

Best sunscreen without a tint. Easy skin absorption without reside, no chalky caste. Great alone or under makeup. Feels like a moisturizer rather than spf. I like the pump container rather than a squeeze tube, although I always wonder if there is another pump left in the can.

Excellent! I gave rosacea and a very delicate skin, I live in south Florida so is very hard to protect yourself from the sun down here, but this sunscreen is the best that I gave found in years! Is not heavy and it protects exactly how it says in the advertising!! 100% recommended

I have dark skin so wearing sunscreen can be annoying since it leaves this ugly white residue on my face. This glides on very lightly and doesn’t leave any white. It moisturizes and I sometimes use it as my moisturizer or on top of my moisturizer. It can be a little greasy if I put on too much.

This sun screen was recommended by my dermatologist and I did not hesitate to pay the retail price. Then, I was pleased to find that I could order it from Amazon. Just be sure to check on the bottom that there is expiration date to ensure that it is a genuine product and not a knock off. It is easy to travel with and doesn't leak in my suitcase... easy to pop in a bathroom drawer... doesn't leave a whitish residue... and best yet, it works!

I have pretty sensitive skin and this stuff is so light that I forget I have it on. It is light nd not heavy at all, my wife wears it under her makeup. Everyone needs this! Seriously.. everyone needs sunscreen so buy this!

I use and like the Elta MD line of products. My dermatologist recommended this product; besides moisturizer, sunscreen, and a little tint, it has hyaluronic acid, which is a nice hydrater. This goes on smoothly and has just the right amount of tint for me (I'm fair), but it rubs in nicely, I think a darker skin tone can enjoy this product too. Also, the SPF of 40 is pretty good. I would recommend this product to my friends.  Excellent packaging and delivery.

MD was recommended to me by my dermatologist three years ago. I can honestly say that it has worked well for me. I never leave home without wearing it. Fine lines are in check and wrinkles are at bay. I am dark skinned and I find that it won’t leave a white film once applied and worked onto my face.

Great sunscreen; absorbs well. Does not leave a greasy or filmy feeling on skin. My teens use it as well without any issues with their acne prone skin. I reapply after prolonged time in the sun and have never been burned and I live in Florida and am outside a lot.

I don’t love the feeling of face sunscreen or makeup with SPF—but I love this one. This sunscreen feels very light and doesn’t feel greasy or have a strong sunscreen scent. It’s pricey, but worth it. A little goes a long way.

I wanted to add a sun protection to my daily facial skin care routine and this is it!! I have been using it this summer each morning and it feels like I’m wearing nothing. It is lightweight, has no smell, and protects my face from sunburn all day! I do reapply if I am at the beach or pool. Never had a sunburn!

This product is non greasy, has virtually no odor and keeps you protected. I purchased it to keep at our beach house and have used it several times already this year. We spend the whole day on the beach several times a week. Let's just face it, I'm on the beach every day weather permitting. We do use a canopy wear hats and sunglasses but still we will get "pink faced." I have been impressed because I have not had the first sign of a sunburn nor has it irritated sensitive skin like so many have. I WILL be purchasing more :-)

I saw this product in YouTube, and the host recommended it among other creams she tested. As she said, this is really perfect under makeup. I am planning to keep using this.

I use this product to put on as a base coat of protection before applying my make up foundation. It is really important to me to make sure that my face is protected against UV radiation as I am light skinned and burn easily. It is very smooth and does not feel greasy like a lot of other facial sunscreens. Another thing I liked is that it has zinc oxide in it, which is an important ingredient for sunscreen to have.
