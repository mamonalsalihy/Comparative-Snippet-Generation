Wish it was more affordable but haven’t found another one that doesn’t burn my eyes as the day goes on.

This is a great product. It is hydrating but not greasy on my dryish skin.

Great protection and just perfect amount of tint

My face has slightly dry skin and a mild sensitivity to hormonal acne (milk and PMS can trigger chin acne). I'm looking for a daily facial sunscreen, and I chose UV Daily over UV Clear since Daily is more moisturizing. It looked great for the first few days; my skin looked nice and dewy, and there wasn't a hint of wearing a sunscreen at all. But I spent an hour in the sun on the third day, and on the fourth day I noticed some obvious tanning and a few blemishes in unusual spots for my face. If it was just tanning, I'd probably continue using it and just put on a double layer, but the acne bothers me. I'll keep it as a backup and keep looking for a good daily.

I tried on it for about one month and it didn't cover my face at all. It has a relatively good scent and soft texture and spreads on the skin well. However, it does not work as sunscreen. All black sun spots have been darker.  Today I took a closer look at the item and compare it with the picture on the website. I noticed that the cap of mine does not have a silver line on the rim. I showed it in the picture. I have a feeling that mine is fake. I would like to return it instead of keeping testing on my skin and being damaged by the sun.

I’ve tried several different sunscreen moisturizers and this by far is the best. It’s lightweight, non greasy, and easy to spread all while giving the right amount of moisture. A little goes a long way and it does not cause breakouts. The tinted sunscreen moisturizer is my favorite too for when I just want a little coverage and not wanting to wear makeup.

Not authentic

I’ve used Elta Face sunscreen for 7 years with great success. I’m not sure if they have changed the formula or if I got a bad bottle or if this is a knock off product, but after using it for 4 days straight, my entire face is peeling and on fire. I will be trying to return the 2nd bottle I purchased that I have not opened.

This is a nice sunscreen that did protect my skin well. For me upon applying it absorbed quickly therefore I experienced no moisturizing affect at all. I have oily skin & this surprised me. Usually moisturizer doesn’t absorb so quickly. Within 5 minutes my skin became very dry. I actually developed flakes throughout my face. My face was dry, not plump & ready for the day. This was a disappointment as this was recommended by my dermatologist for a safe facial sunscreen moisturizer. I was looking for a change. Unfortunately my skin type reacted adversely to it. My safest so far has been CeraVe A.M. Moisturizer SPF30 so I’ll stick with that. This is my personal experience. I do use EltaMD AM THERAPY Moisturizer which is fabulous for improving my skin tone. I feel the brand is worth the $ spent. Unfortunately their sunscreen didn’t work for me. I do feel it would work very well for other skin complexions if you’re willing to pay the price.
