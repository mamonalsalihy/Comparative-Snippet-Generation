The listed active ingredients are NOT what you will receive. Rocky Mountain Sunscreen has been false advertising their products for YEARS. The labels shown in the marketing add for this product clearly show what should be in the product. What I received was less of active ingredients and completely omitting one. What I received was 3% Avobenzone (as advertised) 10% Homosalate (advertised as 15%) 6% octocylene (advertised 10%) and no Octocrylene at all (advertised 10%) This is the second gallon jug I have purchased in past 3 years with same false advertising. I have called Rocky Mountain Sunscreen both time letting them know of the error, but guess what, same false advertising. Buyer beware, I will not be purchasing again

Hands down BEST sunscreen ever. I live on a Caribbean island so I am very concerned with the affects sunscreen can have on our coral reefs . This sunscreen is also wonderful coverage, keeps our skin protected from the strong Caribbean sun.
