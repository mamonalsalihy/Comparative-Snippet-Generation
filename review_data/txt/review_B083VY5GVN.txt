and I love how the bottle changes color as soon as it's exposed to harmful UV rays, including when I am inside (if I am too close to the window). This serves as a great reminder of the need to apply sun lotion generously on my skin.

This sunscreen is amazing. The only downside is it leaves a white film and is very hard to get off

I put this on my arms, chest, shoulders and back of neck every time we go out on a motorcycle ride. I never get burned and it doesnt sweat off of us. Great product!

Great sunscreen. This sunscreen is easy to apply And blends in your skin. Also cool that the bottle changes to pink when there are harmful uv rays. See pic.

Iâ€™m extremely happy with this purchase. It really does protect from the sun and does not make you burn. You must reapply though

Mineral sunscreens are great. Actually they are the only proper sunscreens IMO. But it is very hard to spread them. This is by far the easiest to use among the mineral sunscreens that I tried. Highly recommended

Seriously disappointed. As soon as we got wet; it would run off of our skin. Leaving us look like we were in a paint war. Embarrassing in public.

I like that the bottle reminds me to apply it early in the AM when I'm outside. Used at the beach and the amusement park all day. Reapplied every 90 minutes and no burns. Somewhat water proof.

I have sensitive skin that burns easy. This protected me with no reapply for 4 hours in the direct sun! Well worth the money just wish the bottle was bigger.

Does not take much product to cover. Excellent sun protection.
