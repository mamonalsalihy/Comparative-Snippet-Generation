I researched the heck out of sun block lotions before trying this and the other top products on the market. EltaMD is clearly the best of the best. I have very fair skin and I'm in the Sun all day in Southern California. After 3 years of use I've never once gotten sunburn at all. In addition, it goes on much easier than the other products that have this level of protection. It's not near as thick and goes clear very quickly. The amazing part for me is that with using this product almost everyday, it last a really long time (4-6 months). So price is good based on how long it lasts and that it does it's job really well. I used to pay $45 for the 7oz. Now it's often in the high $20's or low $30's.  I only apply it once in the morning and never again all day running around. On tropical vacations it stays on great in the water as well. I have fairly sensitive skin, but this has never caused me to breakout or have any irritation issues.  Just an FYI... I do not work for the seller or manufacturer and I'm not being paid for my review. I just like the stuff. It works!

This spf 50 is the best I've tried, and I try many lotions/ sunscreens. (Dr. Obagi is just at good but pricey). I'm writing this review in May 2017- about this May 2015 purchase. The product itself is amazing and does not leave your skin looking white or blue, like some products which contain zinc oxide/titanium dioxide; however the price has DRASTICALLY increased and I'm very disappointed. I paid $28.20 for this 7 oz bottle in 2015 and just reluctantly purchased it in 2017 for $48.50. I've emailed Elta MD but have not heard back 3-5 days later. Elta MD is high quality but the price increases of all their products are excessive. I use many of their lotions and love them all. I'm hoping more men/women express dissatisfaction with regard to the price increases in hopes this will change.

It's too bad that Elta MD more than doubled the price of this product in less than 6 months. My dermatologist recommended this for our family's fair skin and it worked great until they jacked the price from $19.95 to $47.50 for ONLY 7 oz.!!!! I went to reorder on Amazon and was in shock. Good bye Elta MD. It was nice when the middle class could afford to use this.

The EltaMD line was recommended by my dermatologist. I’ve tried the Sheer, Every Day, Sport, and Active. They don’t clog my skin and I don’t break out. The main difference seems to me to be their thickness. When I play 3 hours of Pickleball in the Summer, I use the Active. It goes on thick and white, but it lasts. It is so water/sweatproof that you have to wash your hands to get it off. I need to apply only once after 1 1/2 hours. The Sport is great when I’m sweating less. It blends in quicker.

I got this sunscreen based on recommendations by my dermatologist. I have been using it daily for over a year and I love it. It doesn't feel like traditional sunscreen. It doesn't burn your eyes if you sweat. This is definitely one of the best on the market.

I have used EltaMD sunscreen products for many years and been happy with the sun protection they offer! I have still have problems with pores clogging, but NOT with EltaMD sunscreens. The SPF 50 has a slight "sun lotion" smell when first applied, but dissipates fairly quickly (and really more in your "space" rather than near by people smelling it). This lotion applys without streaks, doesn't feel sticky, doesn't stain clothes and keeps me safe on a sunny day. I haven't tested the water-resistant portion ... but their other products with the same claim have been stellar in protection. If course you still need to reapply according to their instructions.

This sunscreen kept me sunburn free while I was deployed in Africa. I used it for times I was spending long hours outside and for my 5k runs. UV index was normally 10-13 during my stay there. I never once got sun burnt when using this product! And trust me, I have seen people get really bad burns out there.  It also held well in the humid climate and during my long runs. I am really happy with this product and will continue to use it now that I am back home.

I was introduced to this brand by my dermatologist. I've used it for 3 years now and I prefer it over drugstore brand. I am picky because melanoma runs in my family.

eos-eos

Perfect product. If you like comfort, protection, when you are running or any outdoor sport activities this is the perfect product. I will recommend this to everybody .I give this sunscreen 5stars .I have been using for few years and I am very happy with it. Delivery it was super fasy. Excellent seller .thank you

Stumbled across this brand while researching for SPF that won't cause acne or have a heinous smell. This meets all my expectations. Light, dissolves quickly, dries clear, can wear under makeup without greasy appearance, and is long lasting throughout the day. It doesn't clump or chunk up or leave a chalky-look if you emerge in water. If you get it on your eyelashes by mistake, it will sting a little, but that is to be expected. Washes off easily. Love this and will continue to purchase, forever!

I'm so happy to finally find a zinc oxide based sunscreen that doesn't make me look like a ghost! And so far, no stained clothing. I have very sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate my face. It seems to work fine under my tinted CC cream once in awhile. Normally I use it alone. It also doesn't have the stickiness that some ZO products leave - Elta blends in quickly and clear. This 7 oz size is convenient and reasonably priced, and I love the pump because it makes it so easy to apply when I might just run off without it (in Florida) sun). It seems to come off easily in the shower, without a lot of rubbing like some. I've already bought a second bottle.

eos-eos

I buy almost everything on Amazon, and what it always comes down to is what other reviewers are saying about whatever it is I'm looking at, so based on the reviews here, this was a no brainer.  My skin is sensitive, if I go out pretty much anywhere for any amount of time without sunscreen I get burnt - so having a quality sunscreen is a must, and this stuff is it. Since using it all summer, going fishing, camping, swimming, whatever - this sunscreen has kept me protected.  This stuff really is waterproof, and doesn't sting your eyes - very tough and resilient. Yes, it's expensive, and the bottle is pretty small, but it's lasted me about 2-3 months and I still have some left, and the protection is worth the extra cost.  Thanks Elta MD.

My wife and I live in Playa del Carmen MX for about 3 months each year. We spend every day at the beach for at least 6-7 hours, and I swim in the ocean for at least an hour each day. This product is fantastic for the intense sun there. My back never burns while swimming. We use about 4-5 oz per week between the two of us. At the end of the trip our skin looks great. We do get tan but not until after about 3 weeks have passed. We also buy the little containers with the lotion designed for faces. It goes on smoother than the Sport Sunscreen. For the extra money do your skin a favor and buy something that really works.

eos-eos

My dermatologist recommended this! Works great, not sticky, leaves no trace once rubbed in. I don’t need to apply as often as it says even after swimming. Luv it and this dispenser. So much better than the squeeze tube application!

eos-eos

Fantastic on body and face! I have fair skin that's a little on the oily side and tends toward hyperpigmentation/melasma in the summer. I was a little worried that it would cause me to break out if I used it on my face but that's absolutely not a problem with this sunscreen. It stays put and does not drip into my eyes while I'm running and does a excellent job of blocking the suns rays. My skin tone is nice and smooth now, no melasma and no zits. Actually it even seems to give my skin kind of a glow. Really just everything you'd want in a sunscreen. I was so happy when Amazon dropped the price to $24 and I wish I bought more at the time because I see the price went back up.

I have bought this product over and over. I searched for years for a sunscreen that wouldn't cause me to breakout like a 16 year old kids going through puberty and I finally found EltaMD. I am extremely fair skinned and love being out in the sun but burn quite easily. Since finding this product I don't think I have had a sunburn. We spend a week on a houseboat each year and I apply this every couple of hours and my friends and family are amazed that I come back just as "pale" as when I left...I consider that a compliment :-). The only downside that I have seen with this product is simple to overcome. It is hard to wash off. I have found that I simply have to lather twice to get it off. It doesn't cause discoloring of your cloths and doesn't have a strong smell.

eos-eos

I have very sensitive skin. I've been using this for about 1 year on and off.The sunscreen doesn't give off a white cast like most others which is nice, however, it does leave my skin looking very greasy. I have also had a handful of incidents where my face started burning like crazy after I started to sweat and I had to immediately go wash my face and pat it with cold cloths to relieve the burning sensation. The smell is not good either. I work with children and they've asked me "what that smell is" every time I wear it on my body and face.

eos-eos

This is a great product! Is not as light and absorbing as the SPF 45 (my favorite, but was unavailable), but is truly more of a sport sunscreen and is a little heavier. I just mix it with some moisturizer and it goes on my face/neck a bit smoother and absorbs better. I'll use it till its gone and then go back to my fave SPF 45.

eos-eos

I discovered this line from my friend. I am so happy I bought this even if its a bit pricey bec my skin is super sensitive that I wonder if my legs would break out from a product. Thankfully this product worked for me. This will be my new go-to travel sunscreen.

LOVE this stuff. Recommended by my dermatologist and cheaper on here than what she sells it for. :) Well worth the money. If I pay 1/8 of the price for over the counter brand sunscreen and it doesn't get used by the rest of the family, then am I really saving any money?  I use the EltaMD for face or Obagi sunscreen for myself on a daily basis (arms and neck and chest for driving in traffic) because I have melasma on my face and neck, but this summer I purchased this for use on an island primitive camping trip. No shade on the island unless we were inside of our HOT tent, so we were exposed for 3 days straight and in and out of the ocean trying to stay cool. Not only did this keep us from burning BUT it goes on and dries so quickly that my 16 year old son who normally will avoid wearing sunscreen due to its sticky feeling, actually walked over several times a day and put this on his arms, neck, face, legs,feet and back himself. That speaks volumes for how great this is.  My 16 year old comes into my bathroom to use it daily now for marching band practice.  It has a convenient pump that gives just enough to slather on the right amount for a limb or torso so you know you aren't using too little.  Rubs in quickly and smoothly with little to no feeling afterwords.  Super Lightweight on the skin.  It is water/sweat resistant as it claims and doesn't have you smelling like sunscreen or sand, gnats and other gunk sticking to your body because you are sticky.  Highly recommend this product, especially if you have an aversion to wearing daily sunscreen like I do.

Love this sunscreen. After having melanoma, I needed a good sunscreen to wear daily. This goes on so nice, no odor and works.

eos-eos

Best stuff out there. FDA approved, amazingly sweat and water proof, less smell, good feel. I don't think I'd want to use it on my face every day (Elta Clear is what I use for that), but I happily use it on my neck and hands every summer day.  I haven't had any fakes/knock off issues so far.

I bought this for my husband and he has reported "sunscreen goes on smooth, leaves a silky touch to the face, does not burn my eyes when I'm working out. "

I like creamy formula that blends in well. It is too expensive though and probably won’t buy again.

I have been using this in Florida for over a year. I have not had burned skin when playing pickelball for hours. Even through sweat and wiping the sunscreen has protected my face from sunburn.

Recommended to my husband by a golfer friend who obtained thru his dermatologist. He loves it...goes on quickly, smooth, disappears into skin and does not leave a white film. Now that he uses this, he no longer has a red face, neck or arms when he gets home from a round of golf in the Florida sun.

This stuff is great. Bought it for Maui against a friends advice who claimed the Four Seasons complementary poolside sunscreen was better. Normally I would have agreed but I had this stuff. It lasts in the pool, ocean, sweat, anything. It has little smell and protects my extremely pale skin. This comes from a person who burns looking at the sun from his hotel room. I strongly recommend. Allergy free as well.

Everything about this product is 10 out of 10.

Excellent for acne prone skin as well. Love this sunscreen. Full coverage and great for sensitive skin. Medium tone color. If you are darker completed you may want to add some foundation to it.

The best sunscreen ever! It is lightweight and creamy, not greasy. Every other brand with the exception of LaRoche Pocey , makes my nose break out. This brand does not but it’s not oily or greasy at all.

After researching many products. EltaMD has all the correct ingredients necessary to protect from the sun, yet is not greasy or sticky. Goes on very smooth. Recommended by my dermatologist.

I wore this on my vacation to Hawaii. I am extremely pale and I was very scared of burning badly. This prevented any sunburn from occuring. Granted I was constantly applying. This stuff stays on in the water without feeling all slimy. When my face would sweat there was no burning of the eyes. The price is a little crazy, but I figure with the trend in medical costs it saved me thousands in skin cancer issues.

Been using EltaMd UV Sport for a few years now and I love it. I am involved in a lot of outside activities and living in Florida the sun is scorching. I have not once since using this product have had any sunburn. Does what it says WORKS GREAT!

eos-eos

hands down best sunscreen. Only thing that protects me while I play tennis in the Texas heat.  Added bonus that is doesn't break me out. This is the sunscreen I tell people to get if their serious about protecting their skin.

I keep this on our bathroom sink to use it daily on my toddler before daycare. Because it has zinc in it, it doesn't bother his eyes (so application is easy and painless), and it keeps him covered all day rather than having to reapply. It's less thick than I expected, but that's sort of nice. The pump makes it SUPER easy - no need to pick up and squeeze each time.

eos-eos

Great product especially for sunny California. It passes the test for protection and application. The only thing when you apply it, there is significant zinc for sun protection. So, you will need to rub it in quite a bit.

eos-eos

I use it when I swim every day

eos-eos

The pump bottle saves money. I use this daily. It goes on thin and smooth with no funky tanning color. I find that the bigger number SPF's break down the antioxidents in your skin so you might go for a number that is large enough protection but not too high such as the 40-50 SPF range--especially if you have sensitive skin.

eos-eos

I have tried so many different sunscreens and this is my all time favorite!

Product goes on smoothly, blends evenly and has no scent. It’s waterproof and effective.

Good protection and no cloying scent!

I was looking for an everyday high factor sunscreen that did not sweat off into my eyes. This is it. It goes on with a nice silky feel, and is not sticky or uncomfortable at all. The only suggestion is to put it on a good 30 minutes before going out in the heat. It also works great on toddlers faces.

eos-eos

We used this on a recent vacation and it was great. Uncommonly nice texture and worked as advertised. We needed a sunscreen to work for swimming and we mostly followed the instructions to reapply every 80 min although we sometimes stretched that out a bit. Very, very happy with this product and will buy again. I also love their tinted SPF 41 sunscreen and use it as my daily foundation.

eos-eos

Does not sting my eyes and goes on smoothly. Hope the sun protection is good as I wear sunscreen 365 days a uear.

Like the large size, good for running but you do need to look in the mirror before leaving as you do have to rub in the white.

Goes on smooth and will rub in to tamp down whiteness of Zink Oxide. In several years, if I don't get Melanoma, I'll come back and add another review. :)

This is literally the best sunscreen. It goes on clear and works so well throughout the day.

I LOVE this sunblock!!! I am currently on the Obagi Nu Derm system and was needing a waterproof sunblock for my face for my outdoor workouts and runs that wasn't going to make my face look white and wasn't going to run into my eyes and this one is perfection!!! Soooo happy I found it!!

Love this sunscreen. It has the right thickness to it - not too pasty and not too thin. Lasted 4 hours in the pool w/o reapplication.

My dermatologist turned me on to this stuff b/c I sweat so much- off the shelf brands would 'melt' off and killed my eyes. This stays on. Still reapply as directed but it kept me safe- I work on a farm so I use a ton of sunscreen.
