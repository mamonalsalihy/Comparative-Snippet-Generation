I found this stuff when I was in Hawaii and it is so worth the price tag. Easy application, water proofing is legit, it is easy on the skin (especially around the eyes where a lot of sprays will irritate) and smells amazing. Always makes me think of my trip, it is the only stuff I use.  Prefer the lotion but I travel solo a lot so always have the spray on hand as well, it has never let me down.

This is my favorite sunscreen. It smells so tropical. And it protects the reef so I buy and make sure to use when It when I dive on vacation.
