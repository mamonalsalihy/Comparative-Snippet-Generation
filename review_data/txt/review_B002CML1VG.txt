Bought this not realizing that it contains oxybenzone which is highly toxic not only to coral reefs but is absorbed through the skin and linked to endocrine disruption as well as cancer. Ingredients such as these have not been properly evaluated by the FDA and therefore I sent this product directly back to Amazon. If it’s destroying reefs, what do you think it’s doing to your internal organs? EWG gives the product a 7, which isn’t good. That’s well into the harmful zone. Look elsewhere.

A motorcycle instructor who works in the sun all day was RAVING about this sunscreen, so I bought it. I'm a ginger and I got sunburnt today because I thought I could go out in the garden for 10 minutes without sunscreen... I should have put on my La Roche-Posay! This stuff is better than Neutrogena (better be, for that price) and goes on thick at first, feeling a bit more like the Neutrogena 100SPF even though this is rated at 60SPF. Then it "melts in" and is quite comfortable and I forget I'm wearing it. I use it on my face, too! It feels more like wearing a bit of lotion / moisturizing cream. It also works REALLY well.  MOST IMPORTANTLY it does NOT smell like sunscreen. It has a "plastic" smell to it which is a little odd at first, but that smell pretty much vanishes after 15-20 minutes. It's not like other sunscreens where I am aware I have sunscreen on ALL DAY and I can't wait to take a shower.  So, my sunscreen collection looks like this:  Neutrogena spray cans + sunscreen lotions for when I'm not feeling fancy enough for a $30 sunscreen, but want something I trust. Trader Joe's 6.99 spray sunscreen. It's oily, but it WORKS and is CHEAP. La Roche-Posay: for going on sun-filled dates or BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I DESERVE IT.  (Banana Boat has betrayed me and forever belongs in the trash.)

You're black and you're reading this? You're considering buying this right? You think because it's expensive, it's a foreign name, the logo and graphics are sleek, all the works- you think that it's a good product for you. It may be good for the job. But it's not good for the person. So go ahead. Order it. Let it come to your house. Let yourself open the package, feel as if you are at a height in the sunscreen product realm, and bathe in the feeling of UV protection right as you're about to put on. Do it! Do it with your black self. Because as soon as you apply it, and even if you rub it in...  ...you won't be black for long.  2/5. Utterly white on black skin. Does NOT sink in or blend in. Leaves you looking like a ghost or like Dave Chapelle's white people skit. Please, please take heed my people.

I specifically bought this sunscreen because the description says oxybenzone free, and the product picture of the label does not contain oxybenzone.  The ingredients list on both the box and tube I received include oxybenzone. :(

I bought this because it was highly recommended by Consumer Reports. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it is very thin (I guess that's why they call it "milk") and with the very least perspiration it got in my eyes and it stings like crazy for a long time.

Excellent, I have fair skin and have had several skin cancers. I am always looking or improved sunscreen options, so I try a lot of different products. This is the best I have found so far. The screen works very well. I can be out for hours and not worry about getting burned. There are a number of good spf options out there, but what sets this apart is how it feels. This is the least greasy product that I have used. So if it feels “less bad” you use it more. That is not to say that there no lotion feeling, there is, this is just the best I have discovered. I have not tried it while swimming so I can not attest to its efficacy. It also helps confirm how good the sunscreen works, based on this being the highest rated product by Consumers Report. It scored a perfect 100. That’s how I found it. The only negative is the cost. It’s expensive for the spf, however I feel it worthy of consideration because of how it feels. I have reordered.

Although this sunblock protected my skin from sunburn, the texture was nothing like its name implies. It left my skin feeling incredibly greasy and if I sweat the smallest amount I was covered in white liquidy film. Very disappointed for the price will go back to coppertone sport for sure.

I am hypersensitive to certain textures and sunscreen has been a big problem for me. I cannot stand the feeling of greasy/waxy lotions. It makes me feel awful. A friend recommended this sunscreen as he works on a ship. I purchased it despite the higher price than normal sunscreens you can buy because I was willing to try anything. I will never go back! Any doubts I had we’re gone with the first use! I still feel it on but I can now enjoy being outdoors without panicking to get to a shower and wash it off. This is a game changer! Amazing stuff.

I am a 30 year old male who has used sunscreen sporadically throughout my life. About two years ago I started wearing this every day, religiously. I apply it once in the morning, right before I leave the house, and once at around noon. Remembering to apply is difficult, so I've purchased quite a few tubes to keep in all of the places I spend most of my time: my car, desk at my office, both bathrooms, and backpack. I began wearing sunscreen purely for cosmetic reasons. The added bonus of reducing the probability of skin cancer is a nice cherry on top, but I often think that the additives in cosmetics, like this very sunscreen, are probably toxic and carcinogenic to some extent. (I am professionally a statistician, and my fiancee is a biologist who studies skin – I have both a healthy appreciation and skepticism of science). If you're very light skinned like I am, do be sure to supplement with vitamin D to make up for wearing so much sunscreen. Seriously, do it, it's like one of only a few vitamins you can take that WILL actually improve your health. Especially if you spend most of your day indoors or wear any sort of face coverings consistently.  My results have been fantastic. I started noticing a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles about three or four months in of twice daily use. Two years in, I am constantly getting comments on how young I look by strangers. A male cashier at a corner store recently commented on how young I look. Many of my friends think I'm about 25-26. These are welcomed compliments since I've never received any like them at any point in my life. Lines that have not disappeared are lines that are caused by repetitious use of facial muscles. I smile hugely and constantly, so my smile lines around my mouth and eyes have remained and gotten a little deeper due to use and the passage of time (and probably because I'm smiling and laughing more than ever).  I have huge pores and acne-prone, oily skin, so I'm weary of products that make me break out. I had to through away an expensive, low-additive, non-toxic moisturizer recently due to this issue. Despite how thick and greasy feeling this sunscreen is, it does not make me break out. Washing my pillow regularly has done more for me than anything else recently regarding my occasional outbreaks. Despite this, my fiancee does not like this sunscreen. I'm in the "if you can't feel it, it probably isn't doing anything" camp, so I don't mind it.  The one big negative is that it stains anything you get it on, so be mindful if you're applying it around your neck.

I purchased this due to the high marks and at Consumer Reports. They specifically tested for toxic chemicals and this formulation safe. Several Amazon reviews show old formulations. I provided a pic that also shows the expiration date so you can see it's a new. According to CR the SPF is closer to 30 which is still good. I was out in direct sunlight on a fishing boat for several hours and did not get burned with a UV index of 10.

My mom has a neurological disease, and if she gets burned, she will have horrible itching for weeks afterward. I also experienced horrible, whole body joint pain when I had my last sunburn. My doctor could not tell me why a sunburn would cause this, but nonetheless, I am extremely careful after that happened. I have used other sunscreens that did not work very well. So, I was very worried about our trip to Hawaii, where the sun is more damaging compared to where I live in Oregon. We used this as directed, re-applying as instructed. We were in the sun all day, every say for 5 days. We came back tanned, but not burnt. I am very grateful for this product and I will use it from now on! This does sting the eyes after application when you are out in the heat, sweating. So, I would urge you to buy the face sun screen from this same product line which is just as protective and does not sting the eyes at all.

I see there are complaints about "Oxybenzone" so I carefully examined my tube, June 8, 2022, and No - no Oybenzone is listed as an ingredient either on the box or the tube. In other respects I like the product for penetration and coverage with out the zinc white. Other protective sunscreen have zinc and it is as difficult as can be to get of of my leather car seats. This product is a keeper.

I bought a few of the top sunblocks from the Consumer Reports list from this year (2019). This one is top of the list and tested at 100% and is great. Double checked price at Target and they tend to charge $41 for it (large tube - 16 ounce). So it is top notch protection, and also top price. However, no breakouts, which is nice if you care. I care enough for this to matter, though frankly I'll take zits over cancer. I've put it on my face and neck for pool deck (2 hours, no burn, reapplying) and running (under 1 hour, sweaty, mid afternoon, summer sun in June and July) and avoided burns entirely.  Seems to have decent moisturizing effects and it's not super oily/greasy, and actually does have a good melt-in feel. I also tried the smaller zinc-oxide based mineral milk melt-in from LaRoche Posay, but found the zinc's whiteness wouldn't disappear, leaving me somewhat purple looking. Not a good look at the office. And i think it was even more expensive per ounce.  The runners up, just behind this one for protection: Also of great value on that list (and available here on Amazon) is Coppertone Ultra Guard Sunscreen 70, which is substantially cheaper but we use it mainly for shoulders downwards. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TKOHMM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Walmart Equate is even better value (half the price, only comes in 16 ounces) and is in a tie with this one.  And for kids' sunsticks (like the glue stick variety), Target brand "Up" 55 SPF for kids tops the list.

eos-eos

good sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist. Not sure its any better than any other sunscreen I've used. Wouldn't buy again. Not for use on face - oily. make sure you order the serum for your face if you break out at all (I'm in my 50s and this made me break out)

This is a fall/winter sunblock. And it is best for face and neck, not only due to the price, but because it is superior protection, and your face and neck will have little to no contact with other stuff that could rub it off..  This is a top notch sunblock I been wearing off and on for years. But I still prefer the Japanese sunblocks, as they are almost like nothing is there, and has superior UVA protection like this, but stronger in sweat /humid weather than this.  Overall 5/5 because this is great all around. And you should cherish having a bottle of possible the best or one of the best UVA blocking chemicals known to man.

Having extremely fair and sensitive skin, breaking out in rashes after relatively short sun exposures and living with a pool in sunny GA has me constantly on the lookout for effective and easy to use sunscreen. I managed to buy 3 tubes of this on special, and couldn’t be happier. It spreads easily, absorbs quickly and has no real smell. I did have to reapply after a little more than an hour, but it took just a quick sec because it absorbs so quickly. I had no reaction to it and didn’t burn. Will buy this again.

I have been using this product for about 2 months now and find myself overall pleased with it. It is a bit greasy, so if you have oily skin it might not be the best, I find that I can skip my moisturizer and just use this when I go out.  pros:good protection, doubles as a moisturizer, absorbs pretty fast  cons:really irritates the eyes and nose if you get any in your eyes or nostrils, not as good on cold days  the "melt-n" absorption seems to be heat dependent. On chilly days it is a very thick cream and takes quite a long time to fully absorb in, leaving a bit residue on my face. But on hotter days it absorbs quickly and leaves a light shiny finish on my skin, so it's definitely not a matte finish.

eos-eos

I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have sensitive skin and I hate the feeling of sunscreen as it’s often oily and horrible to wear in hot humid weathEr. This goes on smoothly and is absorbed immediately. There is no greasy feeling and it protects me for hours. It also does not hamper make up applications. I’ve tried at least twenty different brands and this one rocks in every way.

eos-eos

I know not all sunscreen is created equal, so I looked on the Consumer Reports website. It depends on what you want in a sunscreen, but I decided this was the best option for me. I have used it several times and like it a lot. It's not cheap, but I think it's worth it because I'm worth protecting. :-)

eos-eos

It’s expensive but it’s your skin so it’s worth the price. I’m fair skinned and spend an hour every day in a pool outside swimming and this is the only sunscreen where I don’t burn. I ran out recently and had to use Coppertone broad spectrum 50 spf and I burned within twenty minutes of getting in the pool. I bought the La Roche face sunscreen as well and it feels much nicer to wear on your face than this sunscreen and lasts a lot longer. This is one of the few sunscreens on the US market that is broad spectrum that actually works for me. You want to look for a broad spectrum and one that has a 30 spf, anything more doesn’t add much. This brand only seems to have spf 60.

The sunscreen was applied easily with no problems at all. There was no heavy smell. It was not sticky even with reapplications. I had no problems with sunburn at all. I tend to have irritation to many skin products, and this one was ideal for my needs, I had no breakouts at all. I highly recommend this product for those who are sensitive to skin products.

Too many sun protection lotions are too thick or leave white streaks on your skin, but not La Roche-Posay. As the name says, it melts into skin easily with no residue. It protects your skin from getting a sunburn with an SPF of 60.

Most of my lifetime, consumer sunscreen protection has been a loosely regulated field full of bad products. The FDA stepped in and now sunscreen has to actually protect you while also not harming you. It sounds dumb, but we used to let people smoke on airplanes, it took someone to say the obvious "I don't think those curtains are protecting us from the smoking section". Same deal with sunscreen. This is the stuff Consumer Reports recommends, they were right.

eos-eos

Doesn't stay white after rubbing it in, doesn't wash off easy, doesn't leave oily feeling, actually protects from sun, and a little goes a long way so it lasts. Another plus is my kids don't complain about their eyes stinging when they sweat while wearing this. Originally bought it for my wife but we used it so much I had to buy us all more. Costs a little more but worth it for sure.

I bought this based on my doctor's recommendation. I use it daily on my face especially under my moisurizer, primer and makeup. I usually use it all over as well. I haven't had any issue with it. I rub it in my hands before applying to warm it. The product absorbs well and leaves no residue. I've noticed that my facial skin looks better and my dark spots are fading slightly. I will continue to use this forever. The cost is minimal compared to having skin cancer.

I've been using this product for years - recommended by my aesthetician and dermatologist. I use it on my face, hands and neck. Great for dry skin - I don't use a moisturizer with this product. Highly recommend this and other La Roche=Posay skin products , I've used many other of this company's products. Good quality.

I was looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t burn my eyes(I like to put them near my eyes for maximum protection), and not too greasy for my oily skin. After watching a dermatologist’s YouTube video I decided to give this a try and honestly I’m amazed! It’s fast absorbing, gives my skin a semi matte finish. The down side is it does give a slight white cast, so if you have darker skin tone you might want to avoid this product.

Great sunscreen. My skin looks brighter and more plump when I use it in tandem with my skin regimen. I stay moisturized all day. I have fair somewhat dry skin, for reference. As with many other sunscreens, the only con is it can get everywhere if you don't give it plenty of time to absorb. Definitely recommend.

This is very good sunscreen. Bought for a trip to the Caribbean. It performed well and was a really good sunblocker in fact the best I have ever used. Contains UV-A and UV-B protection. It's is a bit milky (chalky) on your skin at first but blends in after 10 full minutes.

I researched this product and found it contains less of the harsh chemicals or your skin. Protects from the sun really well.

Suffering from PLE for 10 years. Brought this bad boy to Greece for 2 weeks. I finally got some color. I was adamant about reapplying INSTEAD of coming back paler than when i left.

This works well for Sun protection, goes on easily and smoothly, and feels nice on the skin, for body anyway. My face didn't want to absorb it, leaving it really shiny and gross feeling, with noticeable residue which needed addressed with blotting and powder. It made me really regret forgetting to pack my Elta facial sunscreen, but for a body sunscreen, this will be my top choice going forward.  Note: I have not used it while swimming, and only for moderate activity not heavy exercise, so I can't speak to its effectiveness in those situations.

This product is quite costly, but it really provides the best protection I have ever had. It is easy to apply, and not greasy.

Since I had a spot of melanoma a few months ago I now have to be religious with sunscreen every day. I’ve always disliked the feel and scent of sunscreens.

I play tennis regularly and a lot of times during the peak sun hours of 10am - 3pm in Florida. I had used several brands of sunscreen with high (50) SPF such as Banana Boat Sport, Coppertone Sport, Neutrogena, Bull Frog. As you know the higher the SPF the thicker the cream. I don't get burned easily, but I still need a good sun protection from sunspots. I heard of La Roche from a friend and decided to give it a try. It is quite pricey comparing to other brands. But the old saying that you get what you pay for is still true..in this case. The cream texture is light considering the high SPF of 60 and it is truly fragrance-free. Since the cream is not thick at all, it feels better when cleaning off in the shower. On top of that it does not give you that 'whitish, ghostly' look like other high SPF sunscreens. I highly recommend it. At least give it a try.

Still my hands-down favorite sunscreen. Silky and dry to the touch, wears like iron. I have 50+ fair and sensitive skin, so SPF is really important for me. I have been using this brand for 6 years or more, and nothing competes.

Works great! I did not break out at all and it felt really nice on face and body. It does not have that stick sunblock feel.
