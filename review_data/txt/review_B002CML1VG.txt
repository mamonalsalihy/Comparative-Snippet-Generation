I purchased this due to the high marks and at Consumer Reports. They specifically tested for toxic chemicals and this formulation safe. Several Amazon reviews show old formulations. I provided a pic that also shows the expiration date so you can see it's a new. According to CR the SPF is closer to 30 which is still good. I was out in direct sunlight on a fishing boat for several hours and did not get burned with a UV index of 10.

Melts easily but doesn’t protect much from sun

Despite being a chemical sunscreen, I was surprised that this sunscreen leaves a white cast that does not disappear after drying, even after spreading it thin and rubbing it in

We bought it to see if my daughter would get hives from it and unfortunately she did, like every other sunscreen we’ve tried. I do not recommend for highly sensitive skin.

This goes on in the beginning a touch oily but sinks into the skin beautifully. I have been using this as my moisturizer in the morning and I love it. Highly recommend, love that this brand also doesn’t test on animals.

I noticed it contains oxybenzone and decided that was enough to send it back. I tried it once before I saw the oxybenzone and it felt greasy to me and left my skin shiny and white after applying it.

This sunscreen did not meet my expectations at all. I was looking for something that wouldn't burn my sensitive eyes but it does! At the beginning it feels like it's smooth and absorbs well but after a while it pills badly on your skin. I would not purchase it again.

I didn’t like how it dried cakey.

I really love the sun protection on this – I am medium tan but I feel this gives me a solid level of coverage and protection from the sun. Sadly I think this goes on very think and definitely has a "traditional" sunscreen feel, i.e. not very elegant or comfortable to wear. It takes quite a while to rub in and remove the white cast, and I personally would only use this as a body sunscreen, as a facial sunscreen it's a no-go. I would still recommend this.
