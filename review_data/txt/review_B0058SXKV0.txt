I used to like this product because it’s sold everywhere but didn’t realize it was harmful to reefs despite a freakin sticker saying so which is ironic. It contains Octocrylene which is about to get banned in Hawaii by Jan 1, 2023. So yeah just another evil corporation. Try something else that doesn’t murder coral and other marine life.

sunscreen works well. Like the small bottle. It does get really running when its hot.

Banana Boat is my favorite sunscreen and this is a perfect size to get past TSA in a carryon

Put in goody bags at child’s pool party. They were wash to use and the perfect size.

Used them up and will buy more. Good size to bring with you during a travel.

Used this sun screen when vacationing in florida and did not burn at all while at the beach all day.
