This product is marketed as reef friendly presumably because it does not contain oxybenzone. However the four active ingredients used instead, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene, are also widely regarded as not reef friendly.

Banana Boat Sport is a great sunscreen; it holds up through sweat and sea water (or pool, lake, river, rain, etc.) I’ve never gotten sunburnt while wearing it, but I do reapply it every hour and a half to two hours depending on what I’m doing. I was excited to find such small travel size bottles of it because my husband and I are going on a week-long beach vacation, only taking carry-on bags, and needed sunscreen. We fit 20 bottles in a quart size bag, which is equivalent to more than two standard 8oz bottles. See pictures for reference. We can each bring one quart size bag of toiletries per the airline we’re flying with, so one of us will be taking this sunscreen and the other will have everything else. I’m beyond happy with my purchase. Edit: We bought the 24 pack of 1oz bottles.

Saved my skin while in Costa Rica! Was super hot and humid there, so I was sweating like a pig but this sunblock did it's thing and I only reapplied when needed (after swimming or shower..or wiping sweat from face with handkerchief too many times ) came home without major burns and we were in the hot equator sun ALOT... And I'm a fair skinned redhead so that's saying something. Travel size was great. (We only did carryon luggage so the travel TSA size was necessary) but the size was also great so I could carry a bottle in my purse/ hip bag when out on excursions.

I think this is one of my favorite sunscreens, as you don't really need anything more than SPF30 for effectiveness. The spf30 doesn't feel heavy on your skin, and it spreads much more easily. I use this fairly regularly as where I live gets plenty of sun year round. It doesn't sting nearly as much as some other sunblocks when it runs in your eyes if you're exercising either. I like these smaller bottles, as they always tend to get misplaced during vacation, but I love having these scattered around places where I get dressed for the day, so I remember to apply, if just a little bit.

I absolutely love this product. The travel size tube seems to last me for about 6-7 days with twice daily application. Goes on easily and absorbs without that greasy feeling that so many other spf lotions leave you with. The breathing factor absolutely works, I don’t feel like I have anything on when I use this and there are zero clogged pores or breakouts. Seems to even moisturize a little. Love that it’s reef safe. Highly recommend this product. For reference I have olive skin (pretty fair in the winter though) and usually don’t burn very easily.

We ordered the six pack of the sunscreen. These were the perfect size for our trip to Cancun. My wife and I both packed three of these each for our trip. For a 6 day trip to Cancun, we used only 4 of these. It was very easy to store these. For our next trip, I will definitely buy these again but I might try the 3 oz. bottles next time. Make sure you buy these for your trip to Cancun or Los Cabos because they charge so much for this sunscreen there. You'll want to be prepared for fun in the sun.

The sunscreen worked well for a ten day vacation at the beach for people who burn easily. A nice quality is that the size of the containers makes them travel well. Another great feature is that the sun screen is "reef friendly." We were at a beach where that was a requirement.

Got these for vacation and travel since we were going to be in the sun for hours at a time. The packaging was fine and I received all three in the pack, the size is perfect for a suitcase or small bag. They worked well for me and the others who used it. It takes a lot of rubbing in and the application time is long but the protection is there. No one got burnt and I don’t burn I just continue to get darker but I still want to minimize sun damage. The people I was with on the other hand are prone to sunburn but were fine after applying and reapplying as needed.

Purchased for a group trip to DC. Just the right size for travel and more than enough product for groups of 2 to use. The price can't be beat. Would highly recommend for group trips, summer camps, etc.

Nothing compares to banana boat. It smells good, doesn’t get greasy, always keeps your skin well protected! These travel size sunscreens were perfect to throw into my carry on for our recent Hawaii trip. Definitely will be buying again!

We traveled to Panama without wanting to check any luggage. These were the right size to fit in my carryon. They came in a pack of 3 so I used a Sharpie to number them so I would know which one to use. I didn’t want to come home with 3 half used bottles:)

If you need to bring sunblock on your vacation but don't want to check a bag, the Banana Boat 3-pack here is a great solution. I burn easily but did not as long as I reapplied it after spending time in the water. The one time I did get a burn, it was my fault, not the sunblock's! I didn't reapply it enough or cover up when I felt my skin getting too hot.  If you apply sunblock 2 times per day, expect to go through a little over 1 tube per person per week. So one three-pack is perfect for a couple, two of them would work for a family of 5, etc. It didn't feel greasy, although of course if you're sweating it will make your sunglasses slide down your nose (a little face powder takes care of that, ladies).  This three-pack is a great value as well. I found a 3-ounce tube of Neutrogena's sunblock for $10 at a local grocery store. This pack cost less than that for twice the sunblock.  We've used Banana Boat's spray-on sunblock and like it too, but it can't go in a carry-on. Banana Boat protects me better than Coppertone's non-greasy formula as well, so for air travel, this is the choice for me.

Used it daily while on vacation in Kauai. Never burned. Was especially useful while on the beach for three hours on a sunny day. No shade was available to help protect me from the mid-day rays. Only had the sunscreen to protect my skin. It worked.

I took 6 bottles to Jamaica in my carry on (I dont travel with checked in luggage) and had no issues boarding with TSA and coming back. Didn’t get burned. And didn’t have to buy expensive local sunscreen. 6 bottles were more than plenty for two people for 5 nights.

This fair skinned Ohio office working couple used this exclusively on our week and a half trip to Las Vegas last July. We spent the majority of our trip in 112 degree weather outdoors by the pool, on the strip, and primitive camping in the mountains. We never had a hint of a burn. We will be using this brand exclusively for all of our endeavors.

I find it much handier to have 24 of these little dudes hanging around everywhere rather than to have one big bottle of sunscreen. I spread them around to backpacks, cars, briefcases, shelves next to doors, gardening tool sheds, etc. so I am never far from getting the sun protection we all need. I like the product too. Not too heavy or greasy.

Inexpensive compared to the fancy ones. Same ingredients. Love the scent. Reminds me of the beach. I’ve used for years.

Worked well! We only used one bottle between two adults in 3 days. Mine seemed to be brand new and had over a year left on the expiration date, despite what other reviews said! Great bang for buck and will buy again for trips!

I bought these for a week trip to mexico. Great coverage and easy to apply. Would purchase again. Spent a significant time in the pool and ocean - reapplied as needed - didn't burn at all.

These are great for traveling. I brought a few of these on a three-day bike trip and it was very convenient to keep in a jersey pocket or in my saddle bag. The recommended amount a sunscreen for an adult is 1 oz (the whole tube) but with a bike jersey and shorts, I only used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a tube. Didn't get burnt even after biking for 4 hours after application. Also didn't run in my eyes after sweating with it on which I can't say about all brands!

Bought this as a reef friendly item for Mexico & had no problems getting it on. It is thick so you have to rub it in good

Up until Banana Boat, all sunscreens have irritated my skin and seemed to be useless to prevent sunburn. Banana Boat works!! It does not cause the usual burning that I have had to endure with other products. I give my enthusiastic approval for this product.

I got this for my daughter when she was traveling. It packs well and tube is durable so no worries about it spilling in your suitcase. On our return home. Some other liquids were trashed at the airport but they let this one pass

I bought this for the USO. I got some epic sunburns 45 years ago when I served(at sea in US Navy), so I'm sure its important for our young service members to have sunscreen. I hope they find this helpful.

Step 1: Purchase the big box of 1oz-ers  Step 2: book trip to beach destination (ex: Costa Rica)  Step 3: fill nooks and crannies of carry on travel ziplock toiletry bag with these little guys  Step 4: Whip out at beach cabana you rented and apply before heading to the beach. Tuck into swimsuit top to look cool en route to beach. Whip out again while on beach for reapplication (good observation - that was 3-4 steps in one)

This product lasted a long time and kept me from burning in the tropics. We snorkeled coral reefs and I was glad to be safe.

Talk about travel ready size! This pack (we bought 2) was perfect for our trip to Cabo. Everyone got their individual sunscreen, could throw it in their bag and BOOM protection from the sun. It worked well in the pool and ocean too!

I was hesitant to purchase after reading some reviews but purchased it anyway. I looked everywhere and didn’t see an expiration date. You have to apply it moderately and keep applying it, like every other sunscreen, so it will work. Don’t expect to barely apply it once and think it will last all day. It worked great for us in the Caribbean. We applied it three times a day. When we were in the ocean we applied it after swimming too.
