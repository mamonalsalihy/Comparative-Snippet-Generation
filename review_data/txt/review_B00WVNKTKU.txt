Phenomenal sunscreen!! This has 22% zinc oxide and yet, is easily applied and absorbed. I absolutely LOVE this product. I always use zinc based sunscreens but my husband usually hates the accompanying "ghost face" and my daughter is too squirmy to let me work in the other zinc based sunscreens I've used. It can be a struggle to get it on them and blend it all in. This Block Island Organics natural sunscreen is so light- it's a bit on the liquidy side so don't squeeze the tube too hard- it rubs right in and looks natural. It leaves a slightly matte feel which I consider a bonus during hot sweaty summer days. And, there are no nasties lurking in this product. No parabens, dyes, fragrances. I am thrilled I found this sunscreen and highly recommend this product.

For years, I used the Burn Out brand of zinc sunblock. As many consumers know, the formula used in Burn Out was changed and a lot of people started complaining. This is why I decided to try a bottle of this Block Island Organics sunblock. The zinc content is 23% which is high enough to actually protect you. I like that it goes on completely dry with no greasy feel. But be forewarned that you will have a white finish to your skin. For me, the white sheen is not enough to turn me away from using it. You have two choices when it comes to sunblock lotions: 1) You can use the chemical sunblock lotions which contain carcinogenic compounds and endocrine disrupters OR 2) Use a physical zinc sunblock that contains no parabens, sulfates, petrochemcals, phthalates, or nano size particles of zinc. This sunblock lotion fits that description.

ZINC-based is the way to go according to any skin cancer specialist that I have visited. Also, considering your skin absorbs anything it touches it is great to know this is a quality organic product. It is very light in application - you do not need much at all to cover you. Stays on and provides good protection in water or sports. Doesn't burn my eyes like others.

At the urging of a friend, who is organic in all things, i tried the Block island organic sunscreen SPF 30. I was really surprised at how easily it can be applied on my dry skin. It also appears to last and last all day, though they say to reapply in 3 hrs. i use it on my hands as well. It's non irritating to my eyes, though I don't apply near eyes. I strongly recommend this product. One suggestion is that it's more runny than other sun blocks. I dole out a blob on one hand, and apply from that blob, carefully.

After many many many years of wasting money and looking like a smeary ghost, I found this sunscreen. I have to wear sunscreen every day and (used to ) absolutely hate it. I don’t want chemicals on me every day as much as I can avoid them but mineral sunscreens are usually thick, hard to rub in and/or leave a residue. Not this stuff!!! It is truly amazing. Yes, it’s very watery and that actually is a big plus. Easy to rub in, easy to use enough product. Thanks Block Island!!

This is an amazing sunscreen. My family and I recently took a vacation to some of the southern Caribbean islands and took the Block Island sunscreen with us. It worked very well and no one sunburned. It is odorless and rubs in completely. Great for sensitive skin. It lasted through a couple hours at a time snorkeling/swimming without having to reapply earlier. We highly recommend this brand and I have purchased more for other relatives and friends.

Everything about this sunscreen is perfect! It's organic. No dyes,no perfumes, non-nano. Anyone who wants a clean. Sunscreen and good protection...buy this. I have very sensitive skin and this never once bothered me while on Mexico for a week using it daily. .

I have used BIO Sunscreen for a few years now. It is one of the best that I have tested. Primarily for my face and upper body. It looks white at first, but once it is rubbed in, it is clear. It's light weight. No odor. I have yet to get any burn on my face or upper body while in the sun for couple hours. I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen does not cause any breakouts on my skin. I take great responsibility in caring for the skin I have. So I protect it. This sunscreen is great under makeup too. Let it set a few minutes before applying makeup.

This goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly within a minute or two, leaves skin soft and protected, but not greasy. I love it! I use it daily before my walks in the hot Southern California sun. I use it on overcast days as well, as UV rays come through.

This sunscreen goes on easily but does leave a white film that gradually fades. It does offer excellent sun protection and is an environmentally safe product.

The product contains coconut oil which is known to be highly comedogenic. I bought this product because I thought natural ingredients would prevent my face from breaking out, yet coconut oil makes it worse. This is pricey yet not that efficient.  Update: The co-founder contacted me and generously offered a sample of their other moisturizer. This is more like a lotion while the other one is truly a moisturizer which does not contain coconut oil. I haven't found any ingredient of comedogenic concern in that formula. I will continue to update after longer time of use. Five stars for excellent customer service and their effort to provide natural and organic face care options for us. For those who have acne-prone skin like me, maybe the other one(Natural Face Moisturizer SPF 30) is more suitable for us: https://www.amazon.com/Block-Island-Organics-Moisturizer-Protection/dp/B014VFTR4O/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1484342619&sr=1-1&keywords=block+island+organics

We live in LA and have 3 fair skinned children that burn easily. I have been applying this sunscreen daily before school and itś working really well. Itś a mineral and organic blend that makes me feel like I am not giving them exposure to extra chemicals daily. The SPF is great for high sun areas and the zinc ensures good coverage for face and neck that tend to burn. I really recommend this. Make sure to do small amounts and blend so itś not splotchy, but it doesn sting eyes and kids love it! Parent approved, no burns;)

Because I work outside, a good sunscreen is essential for me when the weather gets warm. I'm very pale, and when I get burned (which happens very easily) it's usually a bad burn that lasts for a while. I also have sensitive skin, so it's hard to find a sunscreen that isn't irritating or doesn't cause a reaction. But I think I finally found the sunscreen for me! It's amazing, and works so well! My skin doesn't feel greasy at all after using it, and it has a very mild, pleasant smell. Because it's so fluid, you don't need very much at all to cover a decent-sized area, and it rubs in so quickly it's almost annoying at times. Be careful when you open the bottle though -- because of its viscosity, it'll pour out everywhere if you open it right-side up (I always open it upside down then carefully turn it right-side-up over my hand). Maybe it's just me, but after using it for a few days straight, I've noticed that my skin itself feels softer and smoother too. After using this for a few days, I even bought a bottle for my coworker who also loves it! I'd recommend this to anyone, especially to people with sensitive skin.

Great product in that you know no harmful chemicals being absorbed. I do find you need to reapply more often and it will wash off after prolonged swimming.

This is ideal for the protection of my face & arms. Once I was told to apply in small amounts, unlike a lotion, I am very happy with the product.

Light and relatively transparent for a mineral-based sunscreen. Purchased because it's recommended by EWG and is organic. Very happy with purchase--feel like I'm doing the best for my skin!

Nice minty scent which is unique for sunscreen, not the typical tropical fragrance. It is not greasy which is nice but it takes a little effort to rub in. Once rubbed in well, there is no white cast.

I was looking for a safe sun screen for my family, and I found this through EWG website [...] . I trust EWG guide to help us find a safe sunscreen! This product is easy to apply, no odor, not greasy, doesn't leave white stuff on your face or body :-) My kids hate certain sunscreens which get oily and make their face so white, but they like this product! EWG guides says this product is safe and gives well balanced protection against UVA and UVB. So far we are very happy with this product!! [...]

I have a 2 1/2 year old and a nine-month old, so we wanted to find a lotion with safe, all-natural ingredients that will rub on smooth and easily and most importantly protect them from the sun! We loved this lotion. It has a very smooth consistency and was pretty easy to rub in, which is key when you have a toddler itching to get away from you. Lastly, we thought the white cast associated with all organic lotions was barely noticeable. We're big fans and will definitely use again.

This sunscreen doesn't have harmful chemicals, and yet when you rub it in, it's clear. It's doesn't make your skin white like some of the other healthy sunscreens. I highly recommend it.

I wear sunscreen every day. I use this on my face. I like that the product is more natural. It goes on very white, but soaks in and is non-greasy. Makeup goes on over it very well.

I feel very protected when I wear this sunscreen. I specifically bought a mineral based cream because I read that protection begins immediately rather than 20 or 30 minutes later while waiting for a "chemical" cream to absorb into your skin. I noticed the cream has a pleasing scent but this goes away after a few mins anyway. Looking forward to ordering more for my family.

I love this sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and absorbs more quickly than other physical sunblocks I have used. It's worth the price!

This is the perfect sunscreen for us. As a large and active family, we are constantly applying and reapplying, especially in the summer months. Block Island Organics' sunscreen is the best we've found. It has a clean application, and absorbs perfectly and quickly. Feels great, and it provides incredible protection. This is a staple in our cars, backpacks, and beach bags. We are so glad that we found this amazing sunscreen!

We are using Block Island sun screen at the beach in Florida. Our skin had not been exposed to the sun for a while since we are from the North. It worked beautifully and I even noticed that facial sun block was a very good moisturizer making my small wrinkles less visible.

I love block island product - especially because I spend lots of time in the sun on the beach in Southern California. It's always sunny in Cali (not Philadelphia) and it can be really intense. Finding a trusted sunblock that works well and consistently protects me against the sun is HUGE. A friend recommended BI product to me... and since then I've recommended it to all my friends and family, my beach crew and they all agree it's the best sunblock on the market they've ever used. #1 they're natural and organic. Ok fine - other brands have that too... but somehow they've managed to make a mineral based sunblock without all the chemical UV filters and it doesn't feel oily and greasy. Yay for not feeling gross after applying it on my skin. I'm almost in my 40's but most people mistake me for a young millennial because my skin looks so damn good. Generally speaking I feel particularly good that it's not tested on animals and is safe for the environment. And it's made in the USA by a small, entrepreneurial company so I like that I'm helping a small business grown. Maybe Block Island should be on Shark Tank? Just saying.... Go Block Island Go!

AMAZING!! I first discovered Block Island Organics moisturizer for my face and absolutely fell in love! So I decided to try this one, aimed at protection for the whole body - and I'm so happy that I did!! It has the same healthy, non-chemical ingredients with coverage that actually protects my skin. I'm very selective about skin/sun products being that I'm a Southern California beach girl who loves the sun, but who has also experienced skin cancer in my 30's. This product rubs on great and keeps my whole family protected - including my 5 year-old and 13 year-old, who are constantly in the sun - at school, at the park, at sport activities. It has become my body sunblock "go to". I'm just really stoked that I found this company and that I can stop experimenting and worrying about using subpar products. A really big 'Thank You' to Block Island Organics!!! Spectrum UVA UVB Protection - Non-Nano Zinc - Lightweight Non-Greasy Sunblock - EWG Top Rated - Non-Toxic - Made in USA 3.4 FL OZ]]

With two young children I've been searching for a good organic sunscreen and tried them all. Block Island is the best for me as it doesn't leave white marks on our skin and is just as effective. I reccomend to all my friends.

I decided to throw out all my poisonous sunscreens and try this. I'm a mountaineer and snowboarder living in Colorado and a good sunscreen is crucial for high altitude activities especially when dealing with snow reflectivity. This performed better than any of my previous toxic products. It goes on thick and rubs in easily. I don't mind rockin' the white-face look as do most mountaineers!  UPDATE 7/25/17 - I lost my original container so I bought another. The new one doesnt white face at all and it's thicker! Did the formula change recently? Either way, I'm pleased with this product!

Definitely a must-have for anyone looking for an effective sunscreen that's also organic - none of those harmful or toxic chemicals, so I feel good about using it as well. Also I love that it doesn't feel greasy. Highly recommended!

Am in the sun for long hours almost daily and have been using this product for awhile now. Provides great protection, no dangerous chemicals, and doesn't dry out your skin.

I am very fair skinned, I never tan, I only ever burn in the sun. I have many allergies, reactions to many products and psoriasis. My family and I went to Disney World and I knew I needed a sunscreen that would keep me from burning and not irritate my skin. I have been using the Block Island facial cleanser for years with no problems, so I decided to try the sunscreen. I was skeptical at first. It takes a bit more effort to rub in than other sunscreens and my skin was visibly turning pink as we enjoyed the parks. However, I didn’t burn once! My skin was pink because I was hot. It is an excellent product and if it can protect my sensitive fair skin in the late June Florida sun, it will work for you too! The only reason I did not give this sunscreen 5 stars is because of the white trail running factor. If you sweat a lot or if you’re caught in the rain like we frequently were in Florida in late June, you did get a lot of white streaks that you have to rub back in. To me, that’s not a make or break situation for purchasing this sunscreen but it may be for some people.

I love this sunscreen! It took some practice to get the application amount just right. But once I did it was really great. Felt so natural. And no sunburn! Great product. Arrived very quickly as well!

Not a fan of this sunscreen at all. It smells quite stale, which isn't a deal breaker but then it was pilling and separating, even with thorough shaking before application. It left me with an awful white cast and little white globs everywhere.. was hoping this would be a new staple, heard good reviews from the skin care edit. The only nice thing about this C*ap is it worked for sun protection, didn't burn while on the job site outdoors. Really wanted to love this with it's clean ingredient list, who knows, maybe buying direct from the company's website you'll get a superior product. heard complaints from other people that amazon is selling rancid stuff so maybe that's the deal with this sunscreen separating, pilling and smelling. Going to have to continue my search for a good mineral sunscreen else where.

I ordered this after reading of problems with chemical blockers EWG.org but hated wearing it. Yesterday read Consumer reports that the chemical blockers, while they can cross brain/b.ood barrier do not seem to cause trouble (true?) and that the protection from certain chemical barrier lotions outweigh the mineral blockers. I diid ream a while ago ion EWG that buying 30 SPF is better because they do not need to contain nano particles and I think those are the ones that can cross the B/B Barrier. I have thrown this product away! I did not use it till more than 30 days of purchase. Darn!

Makes you look like Casper the ghost, or one of the living dead. I've used lots of zinc sunscreens because they are the most effective against UVA, tend to run into your eyes less and you don't have to keep applying them. The downside of zinc is it's more unpleasant to wear. You have to get used to them. Not this one. It doesn't feek tacky or sticky. It's just WHITE. Does seem to work, at least against UVB

All mineral sunscreen. Absorbs quickly. A little bit goes a long way.

I had done my research for my toddlers sunscreen since she could start wearing it and have been happy with a different EWG 1 rated sunscreen on her since then. I decided it was time to improve my husband and my sunscreen as well. Being that my in laws have a home on Block Island, when I saw this product on EWG I thought I would try it. We went to BI and applied, while it was chalky and difficult to rub in before drying I figured that can sometimes be part of mineral sunscreens and wanted to give it a full try. With our first bottle, it seemed to work decently well apart from the application issues and the fact that two of us plowed through it in a couple beach days. We opened our second bottle and that day we burned. Maybe it was a defective bottle, but either way, I haven't burned in years because I am very diligent about application and reapplication. I was incredibly disappointed and a little pained on my back, shoulders and forehead, as was my husband. The good thing was I didn't apply it on my 2 year old and she was completely burn free with her original sunscreen. I really wanted to support this company, but something is off with the formulation, and as much as I want to protect the reefs, it can't be done at the expense of effective sun protection. Love Block Island and the mission they are on, but I can't recommend this product.

Protects well, smells good, little bit goes a long way. I feel like I'm doing something extra good for my skin protection.

I decided to try this since I was also trying their face wash. (Which I love!) It's hard to find a natural sunscreen that doesn't coat your skin in a thick white residue of zinc. I was pleasantly surprised that this sunscreen applies thin and light. And it also doesn't have a strong smell (just a faint smell I can't really describe, but it isn't bad). My only qualm is that it applies a little sticky to the touch, so you're going to want to wash or wipe your hands off after application. But, honestly, I do that anyway with every other sunscreen I've ever used. And once it's on your skin it soaks up fast and isn't sticky. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a natural sunscreen or an alternative to the ones that are thick and don't soak in well.
