This sunscreen is super pasty and hard to spread. I have dark skin and after I apply this, I look like a mime. This product is awful

This product would work okay if it wasn't expiring in a week ! I have 2 of the one you sent that I have been using that have expired; I didn't need another one!

I used to use a product that was called the same as this one, but I don't think they are, in fact, the same. packaging changes all the time, so that's no way to tell. anyway. this product is thick and a pain to spread on. I've taken to using small amounts and patting it onto my skin. It is a nightmare to wash off at night. I guess that's good on one hand. I have noticed that my skin stings a little when I am in the sun with this product on.

I purchased this on June 19th 2022. I did not get the tube that is pictured in ad I got a green tube that is expired and it's not returnable! You stole my money

Great non toxic sunblock that stays out even when wet .

This has become my go-to sunscreen. It’s not too greasy, not drying either, and it doesn’t irritate my skin. It applies easily and it blends in perfectly. If you have sensitive skin that’s reactive and prone to break outs, I highly recommend that you try this product. This is one of the rare sunscreens that does not bother my skin. Also, it’s very affordable, which is always nice.

Like the product, easy to use, absorbs, not sticky. Most of all it did not give me a rash! Some others have and I am pleased to use this daily. I let it settle then add my makeup.

I like this sunscreen because we live in Hawaii and it is reef safe. I was paying under $6 and I really liked it. It’s small but worth $6 cause it stays on well. Then I went to repurchase a few months ago and it more than doubled. I understand incremental raising of prices over time but this greed just turned me off. Yes you can price how you want it’s your product. And I can buy what I want and it won’t be your product anymore

I like other alba sunscreens. I thought I was buying something similar without a fragrance. This is incredibly thick and hard to spread. It does leave a very visible whitecast….but does provide good protection. Putting it on is a chore though.

I received this product this month and the expiration date is July, 2022. It is the old sunscreen and is not even the same packaging as advertised. I am not a happy camper Disappointed that it can't be returned.
