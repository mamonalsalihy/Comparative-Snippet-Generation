Make no mistake: This product has unbelievable water resistance. The biggest issue is if you’re a person of color, this moisturizer will leave an extreme white cast on your face. Period. This is not POC-friendly, and I had to wash it off with great effort because of the high water resistance, before putting on another moisturizer that’s more POC-friendly (i.e., Cerave AM Facial Moisturizer). My whole morning was ruined because one brand decided that they were going to design a moisturizer for white people and leave people of color as collateral damage.

I used to be a fan of the UV Shield, and while that is more cost effective than this one - this is THE BEST formula I've used from them. It's moisturizing without being oily and causing a shiny effect, and super sheer. Like any chemical sunscreen, it does sting my eyes so I use a mineral one just around my eye sockets to avoid the eye stinging but I apply this twice per day and it feels like wearing nothing. Truly a lovely formula from them.

As a user of EltaMD UV clear, I wanted to give this sunscreen a try due to its water-resistant properties. It exceeded my expectations. It’s moisturizing, feels very light on the skin, stays on through sweat, and doesn’t cause breakouts. It does give a faint white cast, but that’s to be expected for any water resistant zinc sunscreen.

... This sunscreen is the greatest. All sunscreen has an oily base and this one (like many) needs shaken up before applying - but the consistency is much more liquid-like, making application super fast and easy. I wish I could afford to use it everywhere - and I did for a minute. Soon, though, the cost made me realize, for me, this would have to be a "face-only" sunscreen. You will be AMAZED at how fast you can apply foundation after applying this sunscreen. It will be MY go-to from here on in. I can't recommend it enough.

I really wanted to like this but it did not work for me. It left a noticeable cast on my skin especially in photos. It also caused weird spots on my face to dry out. The texture of the sunscreen was nice but I wouldn't recommend this unless you're super pale and super oily. For this price, I'd recommend skin aqua super moisture milk over this. That one is usually less than $20. This eltamd is not worth it.

I still think this is an excellent product, but I noticed a couple of things when I purchased a couple of new tubes recently (5/2022).  First, the product that I have been using (on the left) I couldn't find anymore. So, I opted to purchase the version on the right. It's equally light weight and comfortable to wear under my makeup, for about the same price as I am accustomed to paying.  The particularly interesting thing is the packaging. Notice that both tubes reference "3 oz" and a metric number of "85" However, upon closer inspection, note that it's now "3 FLUID oz" instead of the previous 3 oz weight measurement and "85 MILLILITERS" instead of the previous 85 grams. So, the numbers are the same, but the volume of product that is in the container (for the same price as the larger container) is smaller.  Maybe the newly purchased product is actually lighter in weight than the previuos product and a weight measurement is more accurate than a volume measurement. If it is an effort to veil the reduction in amount of product for the same price, I think Elta gets bonus points for handling pricing inflation so cleverly.

I have always put off wearing sunscreen because every other sunscreen I wore broke me out like crazy. I read the ingredient list and tried to narrow down what it could be. I found this sunscreen that did not have all those other ingredients I thought were the cause of the breakouts. And FINALLY! a sunscreen that I my skin loved. No breakouts, it really is sheer like it says. My skin has IMPROVED! so much after using it. Was not aware how my acne scars never faded even after all this expensive skin care. If you don't wear sunscreen what's the point of skincare.

I have overall acne prone oily, fair skin. I found that this sunscreen is super light weight, but over time felt slightly itchy-drying, I had to use one of my thicker moisturizers underneath it that fixed that issue. (as opposed to the light weight moisturizer I usually used). It does reapply very nicely throughout the day.

I’ve used this sunscreen in the past as it was only available through my dermatologist office and paid a much higher price. You can imagine how elated I was to find the same quality product here for a fraction of the cost! It goes on smooth and doesn’t feel greasy. The zinc oxide is sheer and very effective! I can even use it on my face without the worry of a rash or clogged pores.

eos-eos

Probably by far my favorite face sunscreen. Everything I’ve ever used has felt like it’s clogged my pores or feels like I’ve put worlds thickest layer on my face. This felt like nothing, when I first started to use it I kept forgetting I had sunscreen on my face it was amazing

I've suffered for years with having sunscreen drip into my eyes when it got hot out. With Elta MD, I smacked on a generous amount while out in the Costa Rican sun and never had a burn and never had it drip into my eyes from sweat or water. Highly recommend. I will throw out everything else I have because this product is so good. Worth the price.

I love this sheer moisturizer with SPF. It goes on smoothly, works well with my moisturizer, and best of all, it doesn't leave a white cast to your skin. I use this daily and my skin looks great!

I have extremely sensitive skin and I break out very easily. I’ve been using this product for over a month every day and I have not had any breakouts, plus it lasts all day long. I work outdoors for a living and I sweat a lot. It doesn’t faze this moisturizer at all - it stays put and I only use about a dime sized amount. It’s not greasy and it’s a bit more like a primer. The $$$ is well worth it!

Works well with my makeup and the fact that I have rosecea.

One of the best sun screens I've used. Light and great under makeup. I prefer the non-tinted but have used the tinted as well.

I don't understand some comments complaining of the white color. Okay, I have a very fair skin, but I don't see getting whiter when I apply it. Great texture. It is light but you feel moisturized at the same time. Definitely would buy it again.

Recommended by my dermatologist. I moisturize, then add this as a base before my makeup. It’s not greasy/or oily. Does not effect how my makeup feels, looks, or applied. Weightless protection from the sun. I’ve even applied it with patting later in the day for the warranted protection from the suns and electronics harmful rays

Elta MD sunscreens are excellent. This is good for face or body. I don't like it under foundation because the foundation tends to flake off after few hours. The Clear formula is excellent under foundation. I highly recommend these sunscreens.

I have used it several times and it comes off pretty quickly after getting wet. I am also still getting a lot of unwanted sun with it. Disappointed.

My skin is very sensitive to anything I put on it. This is the only facial sunscreen I can use that wont cause a flare up of my skin. I use daily.

I didn’t realize this was only 1oz! What a rip off. I can buy 3oz for this same price from the Dermatologist. How frustrating

This is a great product ! I swear by it ! I love the sheerness of this product and honestly use it for arms chest neck and shoulders as well .

I've finally ordered the famous EltaMD and was happy to discover it's just what I hoped for - a light & comfortable moisturizer that deosn't leave any white cast and sits well with any foundation or face powder. I was so happy I immidiatelly ordered two more (one to take with me in my bag). I think it's the beginning of a true lovestory

My dermatologist recommended this and I’m so glad. It’s light weight and covers easily.

I have always loved the sun but as I’ve reached middle age my body started to change and now the sun doesn’t love me anymore. This sunscreen has been a game changer as I’m able to enjoy the sun without getting a rash on my legs due to sun exposure.

Product is amazing - goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into your skin without oily residue - I feel well protected against the sun. I’ve recommended it to many people since I’ve purchased it. It is recommended by all dermatologists - Thank you for this amazing product.

i did get a tube a very small one, but it works great for me traveling. Still the best sunscreen out there!

This product dried out my skin & caused some atopic dermatitis. I always shake my SPF bottles to ensure it's mixed well...this product is advertised as not having a white sheen upon application, but that's not true. IDK if they were thinking of people with pale skin or not when advertising that, but I have slightly tan skin and this product was incredibly white when applied really well. But I let that go, thinking, "Hey, at least it'll protect me from the rays...however, it left my skin feeling/looking chalky and broke me out.

Sadly, I can no longer buy this product. As of 06/28/2022 there was nothing on the Elta MD website expressing concern about the Supreme Court's decision to strip women of their rights to control their own bodies. Products that market to women have to show that they advocate for us, or lose our custom. No one in power cares about our street protests, unless it is to arrest and/or brutalize us. What they do care about, though, is money. Control where yours goes.

I really like the look and feel of this product. It blends on the face easily. The problem is that it is drying on my face. So I am now moisturizing before I put on the Elta. Don't know if I will buy it again. I am 63 years old and have normal to slightly oily skin.
