This is a pair of classic Coppertone sunscreen products that both provide good protection against the sun. As SPF 30, the spray might be a little less protection than you are looking for. I'd typically go with SPF 50 and up these days. The spray version goes on totally clear. There is no sign of white or any other color when it goes on. It smells like a typical old school Coppertone sunscreen but the scent is more potent and lasts longer than I remember old school Coppertone sunscreen scent. That could be toned down a bit.  The version for the face comes with a higher SPF and is simply awesome. It feels very light and if there is any scent it was really, really light. You can buy facial moisturizers that offer SPF protection from some high end facial cream brands that cost as much as $100 for an ounce. While those are quite nice, this Coppertone product feels pretty similar to some of those and is soooo much cheaper. The high end designer sunscreens might be marginally better but considering the difference in price, I think I'd opt for this Coppertone over most any of them.  Overall, this a a good set of Coppertone sunscreens. You can't go wrong with it. I wish the spray version had a higher SPF and the scent was toned down a bit but other than that this is a great combination.  There is no mention that I can find that mentions anything about these being "reef safe". That may or may not matter to you but if you do care about that and are going to the ocean you may want to look for something with that label. Honestly I don't even know exactly what that means but if it does mean something then you might want to buy a product that is if you'll be heading to the ocean. For a day on the bike or hiking trails, this stuff works great!

The Coppertone SPORT duo of SPF30 (chemical blockers) 5.50z spray and the SPF50 (mineral blockers) 2.5oz poly plastic tube is, overall, good. Especially since you are getting both for less than $20, as of this review. I'm primarily pleased with the quality and use of the smaller facial sunscreen lotion. While it is a mineral-based SPF (~24% of zinc oxide), it does not leave a telltale white cast. YAY! Odorless. Double YAY! Runnier than regular sunscreen lotion with excellent spreadability. Melts into the skin without feeling heavy or greasy. Yes, you can tell you've applied something, but it is non-drying and isn't unpleasant to use. Not sticky or anything. Ideal for oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin, but anyone can use it. Won't cause flares or breakouts.  The spray is ok. Comes out evenly and once applied (I prefer it on my arms and legs, larger parts of the body), I can massage in the excess and ensure coverage. The spray is clear, has a slight chemical smell, and a slightly greasy feel. Takes a few minutes to absorb. So apply and let dry before getting dressed or making contact with garments, etc., to avoid transfer. It is convenient and useful. Overall, I like the affordable set. I like the lotion more and wish it came in a larger bottle for overall use. Yes, you can use this for the body as well as the face, but 2.5oz isn't a lot.

My adult son lives with me to care for me and he has a tractor. Working on a tractor under the hot sun requires a strong sunscreen and this Coppertone SPORT SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray + SPORT Face SPF 50 Mineral Based Sunscreen Lotion combo is perfect for him. He has fair skin like his mother as we are natural redheads. Both of us have had to deal with melanomas, too. I was happy to see the Sport Face SPF 50 offered along with the SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray. Getting a man to apply sunscreen to his face is difficult, to say the least!!  Fortunately, this face sunscreen is very light and unscented, a must for most men. It is thinner than most lotions so it goes on easily and actually moisturizes the skin without feeling as if it is doing so!! The protection is wonderful at SPF 50. I've even reminded him to apply it to his neck as he doesn't want to become a true "redneck". (pun intended!!) The fact that he is using it is a testament to how nice it is!!  The spray is more like the Coppertone of my younger years. The scent is still basically the same, strong and long-lasting. Since it sprays on, it is easier to apply and very quickly done. That helps him to actually use it although he rarely spreads it with his hands, something I wish he would do. At least he DOES use it and that makes this mother very happy.  Finding both products in a bundle for $12.84 is a great bargain. The face lotion is only 2.5 ounces but the body spray is 5.5 ounces. They are an outstanding value in my opinion. He uses them prior to going outside, so he doesn't have to carry them with him, but if he were going to the lake or beach, they would be a delightful size to throw into a backpack or beach bag. They are the ideal size for convenience and adequacy. I am completely sold on this combo set and I most highly recommend it to everyone!!

I absolutely hate sunscreen with a passion. If I can avoid it I will at all costs. If I absolutely have to wear it I need the spray so I have to touch it as little as possible. I really wish they could come up with a spray face sunscreen but I digress. I’ve purchased other spray sunscreens that come out in thick droplets that then require you to rub them in anyway which completely defeats the purpose of the spray. I immediately threw those in the trash. This spray is actually a perfect fine mist that provides good coverage as long as you’re not in the wind. It dries/absorbs pretty quickly and is minimally greasy after it’s absorbed. It does have the typical sunscreen smell which I kind of hate but can’t knock sunscreen for being sunscreen. The face lotion that came with this on the other hand actually smells pretty pleasant. It’s a little thicker and doesn’t absorb quite as well but I suspect that’s due to the zinc content. It took a lot of rubbing to get the white to be less noticeable. Because of that and also because my face is super sensitive I probably won’t use the face sunscreen but my husband and kids can use that. I definitely will use the spray sunscreen though. It will likely be my go to for the rest of the summer because the spray is definitely superior to many others. If you’re like me and want as little to do with sunscreen as possible I would highly recommend this spray.

I really like the combo of the spray and face lotion for protecting the kids from sunburns. 30 spf is typically what we use for the kids to protect against the strong Florida sun. We use the spray for their bodies because they prefer it over lotion they have to rub in. They don’t like using lotion for their bodies because they say it makes them feel oily and then the beach sand sticks all over them. The downside to using a spray is that it’s easy to miss parts, especially if the wind catches it when you’re spraying. Just make sure you rub it in after you spray and it helps hit all the spots.  I do like that this came with a separate bottle of face lotion though. We don’t spray their faces in case it gets in their eyes so usually we use regular lotion or one of those sticks. This lotion is creamy and applies nicely to the face to make sure we cover everywhere. We also apply the face lotion to the ears and on top of their heads if there’s any spots that will see the Sun.  We have been using coppertone for years and I know it’s a product we can trust. I like the combination bundle of the spray and the lotion. These will be perfect for the beach, pool, soccer games, and any other outdoor activities.

I am fairly active (for an old guy) and I try and carry as little with me as possible whether I am hiking, walking, or running. The more I have to spread sunscreen on my body, the more I need to carry, so the time that a sunscreen stays on my skin is critical.  Since we live in AZ sunscreen is a critical part of our outdoor life and to minimize its use of it we protect ourselves with UV ray-resistant clothing and keep our arms and head covered. I spray myself before I go out but I reapply with the Sport Face with the 50 SPF rating. The Face Sport sunscreen is small, easy to apply, and strong enough that I can use a minimal layer to refresh the spray that I applied earlier.  And, as with all Coppertone products, it smells great.  Review of: Coppertone SPORT SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray + SPORT Face SPF

Review: Coppertone SPORT SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray + SPORT Face SPF 50 Mineral Based Sunscreen Lotion Multipack (5.5 Ounce Spray + 2.5 Fluid Ounce Lotion)  I have near ginger level of burning. I haven't burned at all whenever I use this stuff. I keep collecting the blue one and use it exclusively. Water resistance for 80 minutes they claim. Just reapply because I swear almost nobody ever comes back on and puts on anymore.  I prefer 50 to 30 but it depends on you.  Normally I just use the blue stuff on my face as well but it's nice to also get a special face version without oil and easier on the face. Just make sure you rub it in nicely.  I find the spray stuff is easier to apply but the bottle doesn't last as long as the cream.

Current price $18.96.  Great set of sunscreen. I like this set because you get both the face lotion and the body spray. You can use the body spray on your face but it is only rated 30 where the face cream is rated 50. I'm a runner and I use the 30 on my shoulders and legs and the cream, on my face. The cream doesn't run into my eyes so I can still see when I'm running. I stay protected for about 80 minutes thought I typically only reapply every few hours and I haven't burned. I don't leave the house without it! 5 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! The spray can be a bit greasy if you spray it on too heavy. So, I try to spray it on and then spread it out. Seems to work much better.

I put this on within minutes of delivery and it's great! Living in a sunbelt state it's sunny nearly every day of the year. The regular spray bottle is great - works like you'd expect. The face stuff in the tube is runny and white and does need a little rubbing to get it spread in well. I'll add it's not nearly as much effort to spread as the zinc oxide stuff you see from the 1980's snow skiing movies. Highly recommend!

This sunscreen has been a lifesaver for a quick, easy to apply, and well-formulated sunscreen. It goes on well with its sprayer nozzle and is lightweight and airy. You can hardly tell you are wearing sunscreen once you spray it on, as it's so breathable and non-irritating. I have loved using it for this reason alone. It is a fantastic price for not one but two sunscreens included in the set, as the other is perfect for faces with its oil-free and naturally sourced zinc oxide ingredients. If you are looking for a great sunscreen, look no further as this one by Coppertone is effective, well-sourced, and perfect for quick, on-the-go outside activities.

These are good sunscreens, made by a company I trust. I really like these are free of certain chemicals, in particular I have been trying to avoid oxybenzone, but it is nice to see that both of these are also free of octinoxate, PABA, and phthalates. It is a nice set, in that it includes a lotion for the face and a spray for the body. Between the two products, I do prefer the spray version as it is easy to apply, and I feel that the chemicals that it does include may provide more protection than the zinc oxide alone which is the sole active ingredient for the face sunscreen. This is a good set of quality sunscreens. I like it.

As always, Coppertone delivers. The face sunscreen goes on smoothly but you do have to be careful not to over apply if you don’t want your face to have a white glow. It does however work well to keep me from getting burned. It also does not cause any skin irritation or blocked pores so I have had zero issues with breakouts on my face. The spray works well also. The nozzle sprays an even mist that provides good coverage and excellent protection. Overall, this is a great set.

This sunscreen duo offers a spray body application and lotion for the face. The spray is simple to use. It’s preferred by my kids and it gets the job done quick. The protection is solid and it works well.  The lotion is a bit runny. It’s not too thick but easily smears on. Again, the coverage is very good.  So much sunscreen gets used every year and to have a face and body option in one set makes for safe family outings.

This is a nice set! I didn't have to chase my grandkids down to put in on them. Once it was applied, I didn't have to listen to complaints about how "Stank" it was!  I especially love the fact that the body spray is effective in the water for well over an hour! My grandkids would live in the pool if we would let them. The Coppertone duo has made this summer's visit a little less stressful.

Coppertone is a classic!  This two pack of Coppertone SPORT SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray + SPORT Face SPF 50 Mineral Based Sunscreen Lotion is a perfect combo for your outdoor needs. A great feeling spray and a higher SPF lotion to protect your face.  Trusted name. Great product. Great two-pack. Great price! Get some so you have it one hand for your summer fun!

This duo comes with a low SPF spray and a higher SPF face sunscreen. I wish both had been SPF 50, but that's me and I burn easily. Not bad for a basic protection pack and any sunscreen is better than none. Got this set for my sister to put on quickly when she goes hiking. Faces get more exposure anyway so more protection there is crucial. Don't forget the ears!

Hot sunny weather is here and with it, the need to protect ourselves from harmful rays. This sport 4-in-1 performance spray (chemical) and sport mineral lotion combo is good for active individuals like myself. It’s water resistant with no visible white cast and doesn’t look or feel greasy. All in all, I’m happy with how well it protects.

I have trusted Coppertone sunscreen for many years and it has never failed once. This combo pack is great and works just as is should. The scent is pleasant too. The only reason why I removed 1 star is that it is pretty expensive for 1 spray and 1 face lotion. If the price was about $5 cheaper, it would get 5 stars.

This is a product my family has used for years. I like the smell of their other products better, but works great. I have pressure hives so I can’t just rub anything on my skin. Spraying is easier. I did hear recently that it may not be good for coral reefs. I have not verified this.

Many mineral based spfs do not make my skin happy. Itchy and blotchy. These by copper tone don't do that to me. And, even after an afternoon of direct sun I'm not left red either. The price for this value set is great, and love the multipack of it having what I use and need.

This is a double package of classic Coppertone sunscreen! It arrived quickly and well packaged. It has the classically beautiful Coppertone odor. It is easy to spray and covers the areas very well! The cream is easy to spread and provides good coverage as well!

My husband can't use the stick sunscreens like my kids and I do, because his beard tears it up. This is a great combo for him. Liquid for his face, and clear, easy spray for his neck. and chest (if he isn't wearing a long sleeve top).

Perfect for my son. Easy to spread/ spray on. He’s outside sweating all day playing and this helps him sooo much from the Florida sun !
