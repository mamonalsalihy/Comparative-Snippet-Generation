OOOOOoOoOOo babe! This sun tan lotion does wayyy more than protect ur buns from those nasty unwanted UV rays that'll roast u like a pig on an easter celebration! Let me tell you a little story! So I was walking me and my pup down to the river to go for a little boat ride, lazy style. And I reached in my bag for this lotion! I pop the cap and instantly the smell takes me back to my vacation down in Mexico where the coconuts and aloe is fresher than a new box of altoids! MMmMMMMMmm makes ya want to go home and slap yo mama silly! Well I's not the only one who was taken! the cute neighborhood boy who i maybe not so accidentally walk by each day caught a whiff on his front porch and hollered me over. He said to me damn babe you smell good! You can probs do the figuring out of the rest for your self but if it wasn't for this coco butter sun tan lotion I wouldn't just be burnt I's also be single! oOOOOooO sun bummmm! i do's love ya!!

Great product for a non checked bag on an air plane. We love the smell and how it's not oily.

Best sun protection for kids or adults. We are a very active family especially on the beach and in the surf. We like that applies white and once absorbed it’s sheer, so difficult to miss a spot. Great aroma as well.

I have been using Sun Bum for a couple years. I love how these smell and they rub into your skin nicely without leaving a greasy, filmy residue. I enjoy this brand a lot.

I have very sensitive skin, I’ve reacted to several sunscreens in the past. Sun bum is great! Easy on the skin, great protection, goes on smooth and doesn’t leave behind any white residue on your skin. I usually get the spray bottle also for easy application. Great product and supposedly reef safe also!

Purchased for a trip to Jamaica and it did not disappoint. Goes on nicely without feeling greasy and no horrible smell. Great for the reefs!

We love sun bum! These travel sizes pass airport inspection. Also, we used these in Hawaii since they do not cause harm to coral reefs.

This is my "go to" sunscreen. Goes on easy, smells GREAT (tropical) and doesn't give you a pasty white sheen on your skin.

No sunburn.

Great smell, effective sun protector, no chemicals, good for the Ocean.

I use it on occasion when I'm out running, doing yardwork, etc. on those hot summer days. It works as advertised, prevents sunburn.  One note of caution. If any of the sunscreen gets into your eyes, it does sting. I found out the hard way on a very hot day as sweat worked its way from my forehead carrying some traces of the sunscreen along with it. But even then, I'll take that discomfort over sunburn any day of the week. So now, I'm a bit more judicious about how I apply the sunscreen, and a bit more careful in how I wipe the sweat from my brow.

Sun Bum products are NOT reef safe. They are illegal to import into the USVI due to their active ingredients which are killing the reef. Since 2020 USVI has banned the import, use, distribution of sunscreens containing oxybenzone, octocrylene & octinoxate. They do have a white package of mineral sunscreen that is legal. But other companies also sell the legal product (and have for awhile) without the deceptiveness of Sunbum.

Took these to Mexico, with frequent reapplication (every 80 minutes) no sunburn and loved they were able to go in our carry out. These two tubes lasted us theee days for two people
