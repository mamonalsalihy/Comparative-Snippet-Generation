Love this sunblock so much. So cheap!! But it is a great protector for my skin. I usually apply it for my hands protection, but tried it for my face several times. I adore this sunscreen and gonna order this again. I live in Texas so I guess this sunscreen works well in every other states haha!

I adore this sunblock! I burn very easily and am always on the lookout for an affordable sunscreen that works well and dries down quickly, while still feeling nice on my skin.. This product meets all of my needs and even more! The scent isn’t very strong (like you would expect with many other sun protection products) and this leaves no white cast, very sheer! I also love that it’s cruelty free and reef friendly! I will continue to purchase this ☺️

I bought this to use on deployment. While it does work, it is so incredibly greasy! The scent is pretty strong, imo.

...it all depends on who you are. I know this might sound obvious, and quite possibly illicit a deadpan reaction from *you*, but it's true.  Disclaimer: I bought this item at a retail store but felt like I needed to put this review for the oblivious shopper who only relies on 5-star reviews seemingly because...it's 5 stars.  While not officially diagnosed by a doctor, it appears I may be suffering from PLE, short for polymorphous light eruption. Basically, it's a skin rash caused by sun rays because the skin is too sensitive. Regardless of a professional consultation, I can definitively say that I (especially my forearms) suffer from sunlight sensitivity. Thus, little red bumps appear on my forearm if they are bare and unprotected, regardless if the temperatures are moderately in the 70s or sweltering in the 90s.  I have been using this item all of April and May in 2022. I still get the pesky red bumps. In April and May. In California where the weather during peak sunlight hours were between 75-80 degrees. Now in the middle of June, the temps will regularly be in the 90s.  That is the personal aspect of my review that [hopefully] provides some insight to those who are looking a little deeper for products they truly *need*, not just fishing for 5-star reviews on a product that you know you could get at a local retailer and you just want to take advantage of your Prime account.  As far as the ancillary stuff about this product is concerned, I personally do not feel as though my pores are being clogged. So that's a plus!  The scent is very mild, which can be subjective to other users as some want that strong sunscreen scent to remind them of previous summers.  For me, I am not a fan of it leaving my hands oily. Perhaps this is just a sunblock thing, but using this product to sweat but not be in water, be careful of rubbing your eyes with any residue of this product on your hands/fingers. It will sting.

Me encanta está marca como protector solar corporal. La textura es ideal para mi gusto, no se siente pegajosa como otras que he probado; más bien parece una crema humectante y de un sutil aroma.
