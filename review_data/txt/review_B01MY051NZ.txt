There are 5 of us.. all freckled and light skinned and easily burned. the only time we burn with this is if we don't wait at least 10 min after putting it on. its kinda hard to wait at the amusement park. also doesn't smell like sunscreen! my hubby (a mans man) does not feel like he smells like a woman either. smells great!!  ps.. when we do burn we use- Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless After Sun Gel Lotion With Hydrating Aloe And Gel Ribbons, 6 Ounce .. even when our skin is almost purple, we only have to use it twice. that night and in the morning. aloe vera gel has never worked well for us but this is amazing!

I live in southern Florida and am in the sun a lot. I had a tough time finding a sunblock that actually worked. This is the only sunblock I have used that didn't lead to a sunburn.  I apply it prior to going into the water, I apply it after getting out of the water and if I'm outdoors without water, I apply it maybe every hour.  It's lightweight and doesn't smell too much.  It does make my face breakout which is a bummer but it's better than skin cancer on my face. I purchased the equivalent spray sunblock in the same SPF and brand for my face and I still get breakouts so, I think that's just the cross you have to bear with it.  It soaks in quickly so my skin doesn't feel buttered. I haven't had any issues with sweat/ getting sunblock in my eyes, unlike other brands.  I've tried every brand from the expensive fancy ones to the drug store brands and honest to goodness, this is the only one that works.

Hands down one of our favorite sunscreens. While using a physical sunscreen is better, sometimes you just want something easy to put in that doesn’t smell or feel like junk. I wouldn’t recommend using this on the face especially near eyes. But this is a great everyday option for the body. I had melanoma in the past and wearing a sunscreen daily is a must. This leave no greasy gross feeling or white cast (since it’s a chemical sunscreen).

I love this product, Here is why I decided to give it 5 stars:  I am a fair skinned red head, I burn VERY easily. I live in the northeastern part of the US and this is where I've used this. With this product I feel that it is true to being SPF 50. Using this product as instructed it does prevent sunburn for me. I actually get a little bit of a tan pushing to 80minutes but I've never burned. This is also using it while in the pool or lake.  I love that this product smells great, is easy to apply, absorbs quickly, is non-greasy and is almost my absolute favorite sunblock that I own.  That being said, this is NOT a product I would use if I was going somewhere closer to the equator. My skin is too fair, I'd use a higher SPF. I haven't found one yet by this company but if they make a higher SPF I'm sure I'll use that too!

I have medium tan skin with hairy legs and arms. I bought this specifically for my body, I’m usually doing outdoor activities like running or hiking. I was surprised at how well this sunscreen blended into my skin without any white cast. It also did not clump on my arm hair or leg hair, which is excellent. It applied very nicely without making me look greasy. I personally prefer no fragrance but i don’t mind the scent. It kinda smells like coconut. It’s also oil free. I’m loving this sunscreen so far. Hope this helps!

This is the best sunscreen I've found. It didn't have the gross sunscreen smell, didn't stain my clothes, and most importantly-- it protected my Minnesota winter skin from the strong Caribbean sun. It does need to be reapplied, as any lotion would. I was worried an SPF50 would mean I'd get no color at all but I did still tan, just didn't burn. It is my go-to sunscreen lotion for fun in the sun!

Consumer reports had this down the list a bit, but I’ve had great luck with it. Works great for an overall sunscreen. Smells coconutty and has very subtle sparkle in the lotion. We are fair skinned, so we use this then hit shoulders and face with zinc stick. I wouldn’t use this for a day at Disneyworld or at a tropical resort or a super hazy August day (I would go with the white pasty zinc stuff for that), but with some reapplying at the lake, beach or pool it’s great! Also my daughter doesn’t hate sunscreen with this.

We purchased three different “reef safe” sunscreens for a recent trip. This one was by far the favorite. We used the whole bottle, and barely touched the others. This one was the easiest to apply (most where thick, and gritty), Hawaiian Tropic was smooth and rubbed on easily. And it has a neutral scent, so once it was on I hardly noticed it. I usually burn easily, so I apply sunscreen religiously 3-4 times a day. Apparently this stuff did the job, since I spent a week in the ocean snorkeling and didn’t get sunburned.

Easy to apply and doesn't sting. Our family bought five bottles of this sunscreen for a two-week vacation to Baja during the summer months when the sun is ridiculously intense -- think 120-degree desert sun. I thought that it would be enough for us but we ended up buying five more bottles mid-trip because we needed one bottle/person/week. That was two or three years ago and we've never used another brand/line of sunscreen since. Nobody in our family burned using this product and it doesn't sting sensitive skin like spray-on sunscreen does and it is easy to apply as it's not super thick and gunky like other lotions. It's also rated as "fair" on the EWG database, which is good enough for me considering the price difference between "fair" and "good" rated products.

I love the smell of this sunscreen. It's lightweight and doesn't feel sticky like some other sunscreens I've tried. I've got fair skin and can burn pretty easily but I can put this on and spend quite a few hours in the sun without any issues. Even when I'm out for a run and get all sweaty, this still feels light on the skin. I'd definitely recommend.

We went to Disneyland in 93 degree heat and this saved us from that scorching sun. My husband always burns and this protected us both completely. So glad I read all the reviews and ordered this item. Thank you.

eos-eos

I love it! I was using a spray sunscreen and getting burned every time. I started to think maybe I wasn’t getting it everywhere so I thought a lotion would be easier to see and reach everywhere. I think I was right because I didn’t get even slightly burned and I got a tiny bit darker, I feel it protected my skin very well. Also, I really like the smell of it!

eos-eos

I bought this sun screen because I was looking for a sun lotion that isn’t too strongly scented. I applied this sunscreen and at first it has a pretty subtle smell, once being on the skin it doesn’t really smell like anything at all. I am very pleased with that. It goes on nicely, not sticky, leaves my skin feeling nice. Doesn’t leave a white residue. I am very pleased with this product and would buy again.

eos-eos

This is the best sunscreen ever. Good sun protection without being greasy and thick and breaking out the sensitive skin in our family (even on faces). I struggle to find this product in spf 50 at the store but was even cheaper than Walmart here. Would definitely recommend.

I bought this for a trip to Cancun in February. I live in Montana and therefore I have very pale skin color, so the concern of sunburn and sun sickness was very real! After a week of using this I have some tan and absolutely no burn! Great product!!

eos-eos

I adore this sunblock! I burn very easily and am always on the lookout for an affordable sunscreen that works well and dries down quickly, while still feeling nice on my skin.. This product meets all of my needs and even more! The scent isn’t very strong (like you would expect with many other sun protection products) and this leaves no white cast, very sheer! I also love that it’s cruelty free and reef friendly! I will continue to purchase this ☺️

I've used this sunscreen for the past few years. I am outside all the time. Not a single burn. Even when I traveled to Costa Rica and was out in harsh sunlight for 12 hours/day. I've compared this product against expensive sunscreens and this comes out ahead every time.  Non-greasy, water resistant, rubs into your skin feeling comfortable, and even smells like fresh summer on top of that. There is no contender for this sunscreen. Buy this sunscreen for life.

Been using this sunscreen for the last 4 years. It has never let us burn. We used it in Colorado, Florida, Mexico and Dominican Republic. I recommend this over anything else.

WISH I COULD OF TRIED THIS PRODUCT, CAN'T TAKE ON A AIR PLANE SECURITY KEPT IT ASK THEM HOW IT WAS

Blocks the sun! Lasts a long time, put it on when I did a 5 hour hike and no sunburn. I am not saying you can put this on and lay out in the sun for 5 hours, I am just giving my experience with this product.

So far so good, I recently moved and I spend a lot of my days outdoors, I made the mistake of not wearing sunscreen one Saturday afternoon and after that went and immediacy ordered this. Great protection so far, been out for about 4 hours at a time with this on and it protected my sensitive skin. It’s lightweight and smells nice compared to others.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen! No only does it smell great! But it repels mosquitoes too. It’s something about the scent that does it!

eos-eos

Used at beach and did not burn the whole week and tanned nicely. Highly recommend!!!

eos-eos

I really like the bottle the sunscreen is in, but that's beside the point. This is easy to apply, and has a non-oily feel. I love the slight coconut smell. This is the first sunscreen I've used on a daily basis since it doesn't evaporate and bother my eyes, and I'm living at higher altitude now. I have had very little tanning from being outside, so I'm very happy with its screening ability.

eos-eos

I wear this lotion every day regardless of whether the sun is out or not. I did some research and it has some of the same ingredients as over-the-counter wrinkle creams. The scent is amazing and it makes my skin so soft. Great price for what you get. Will buy again.

My son is very sensitive to sunscreens. This works perfectly and doesn’t give him a rash. Rubs in easily too

I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and I never have any issues with burning or breakouts when using this product. Also, it smells like paradise!

eos-eos

Easy to apply and it absorbs quickly. I do a powerwalk outdoors for an hour 6 days a week and apply it each of those days. Better than other options I have tried.

eos-eos

Great for vacations (we usually use spray but sometimes thats hard in more crowded spots or on the go). Great coverage and protection.

eos-eos

It's sunscreen, what's there to say?  Smells good, is REEF safe, and its a great value per oz for my region.

eos-eos

Best sunblock ever. I have very sensitive & fair skin, and this stuff is amazing. It does have a tropical sunblock scent, but I love that about it. Absorbs into the skin too! No sticky sunblock feeling.

eos-eos

This is actually the first sunscreen brand that actuary has protected me from burning. I have tried up to SPF 100 in every other brand and I still always get so fried, even with on time reapplication. This sunscreen I actually forgot to reapply and I still didn’t burn after a day of four wheeling in the Utah desert. Great coverage and protection

eos-eos

Love this sunblock so much. So cheap!! But it is a great protector for my skin. I usually apply it for my hands protection, but tried it for my face several times. I adore this sunscreen and gonna order this again. I live in Texas so I guess this sunscreen works well in every other states haha!

eos-eos

Hawaiian Tropic is my favorite brand, mainly because it smells so good! This sport formula also works great for me, I get the best protection from the sun while having fun at the beach without it wearing off.

eos-eos

I've been using this for a little while now and have never gotten burned. I apply a little more than some might but I have fair skin so I burn easy and don't want to take the chance. Never had an issue, and it smells great and lasts a long time.

We are avid desert golfers. This sunscreen does not sweat off or sting your eyes. It has a pleasant fragrance. We also use it on our grandchildren and no one has ever gotten a sunburn.

This formula has a thicker feeling than the sheer formula. It smells amazing and SPF 50 is petfect. I love this product.

So far, the best overall sun protection lotion I have ever tried.

If you put this on in the AC before going outside you will be good all day. Like the scent. Much better than the sprays.

eos-eos

Great product rubbed in well. Works well if you sweat alot as well. You do have to re apply after going into the water a few times but great product. And it's Reef Safe.

We needed sunscreen that wouldn't run out too quickly like the spray on ones, so we tried this one. It smells really nice (coconut).

This is the ONLY sunscreen my son will wear. He loves the smell of pineapple and coconut and it's not too greasy. I love it, too.

eos-eos

This stuff works great! I have sensitive skin, and had no issues with this during week-long multiple daily uses during a trip to Hawaii. The scent is amazing - lightly floral/tropical - but is not overpowering, and fades quickly. I reapplied every 90 minutes or so and I did not burn at all. I now use it as my daily sunscreen on my face and it works great under makeup or alone.

eos-eos

I love this stuff! The scent is good, but also pretty heavy! It kind of makes you smell like coconuts or something tropical, which I like. This is also the best deal in town! Most stores don't even sell this particular formula!

eos-eos

Great protection. Will last me a while.

Rich moisture holds on skin, does not disappear into dryness as some lotions do.

eos-eos

With many sunscreens I need to apply them every hour on the hour to avoid getting burned, but didn't feel that I needed to do that with this product. It goes on well, is sheer when rubbed in, and water resistant for about an hour. I'd buy this again.

eos-eos

Not sticky or greasy love the scent! But must reapply regularly

eos-eos

Love this sunscreen, I never use any other brand. I hate the smell of sunscreen so I absolutely love that this sunscreen smells nothing like most other sunscreens and has a light tropical/coconut smell. Works super well and protects my very fair colored skin.

I love this sunscreen I will definitely buy again. I use it everyday on my face and body and It protects me very well from the arizona sun.
