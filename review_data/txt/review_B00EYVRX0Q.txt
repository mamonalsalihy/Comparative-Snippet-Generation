I've been using Paula's Choice skincare almost exclusively for around five years. I'm 36, with very oily skin and enlarged pores. The toner and 2% liquid BHA have greatly improved my skin tone and texture, but I've never been able to find a product to wear during the day that will keep my skin matte without exaggerating my pores, plus offer that all important sun protection. I've tried every ultra-matte foundation, mineral foundation, and shine stopping primer under the sun. They would work for a few hours, but before noon I'd be reaching for my ubiquitous oil blotting papers. So when I read the reviews that this offers all day matte finish, I knew I had to try it.  I applied in the morning to freshly cleaned and toned skin. It has a bit of beige tint, but I have fair-medium skin and it blended perfectly, but it doesn't really provide as much coverage as a tinted moisturizer, so you might be disappointed if that's what you're looking for. It went on a bit shiny, but dried after a couple minutes. That's when the magic started. I brushed on a little loose translucent powder over after it dried, and my skin looked perfectly matte and flawless, every pore hidden. I was impressed, but the true test for me was to see how long until the oily shine broke through. I couldn't believe it! By noon I was still matte! (Did I mention I have seriously oily skin?) By two o'clock, still matte. By three o'clock, just a bit of shine on top of my nose, but I dabbed lightly with a clean tissue and I looked like I did in the morning. I can't say enough great things about this product. The oil-control by itself is enough to keep using it. It's great by itself with just a little powder, but if you need more coverage, I think this would work great as a primer under foundation. The full spectrum sun protection is a huge bonus too. However, if your skin is on the drier side, or you're looking for a true moisturizer, I don't think this is the right product. I didn't find this to be moisturizing in the least. But if you're like me, and have been searching for something to wear during the day that will stop shine and provide sun protection, either by itself or under makeup, look no further. I may start buying in bulk just because I don't ever want to be without it!

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Paula‚Äôs products but this remains my go to tinted moisturizer for everyday use. It‚Äôs thin and moisturizing. Doesn‚Äôt make dry skin flakey and isn‚Äôt oily. If I took a picture of before and after applying it, it almost looks like I‚Äôve photoshopped the after pic with a skin filter. Perfect for when you don‚Äôt want to wear makeup. This and some mascara is all you‚Äôll need.

I bought this thinking it was going to be trustworthy for sensitive skin based on the reviews, and quite frankly, the price. I still did a skin test to be sure and all went well. Once I put it on my face, things went south. I drove to work (about 20 min drive) after applying this before I went out the door. I noticed my face is was itchy in a few spots. When it didn‚Äôt fade and my face started to go numb, I looked in the mirror and found my cheeks looked like this. I have taken medicine, washed my skin thoroughly, and am still in quite a bit of pain. I‚Äôll be going to urgent care soon if it doesn‚Äôt let up.

First of all, when you buy a mineral sunscreen that contains Zinc, you have to know that you can‚Äôt expect it to be invisible. I‚Äôm saying this because there are way too many people complaining about the so called ‚Äúwhite cast‚Äù. It‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of the white cast because Zinc is a white powder and its function is to reflect the sun light so it doesn‚Äôt get to your skin. If you definitely don‚Äôt want the white cast, go for a sunscreen that has titanium dioxide. With that said, this sunscreen is hands down the best I‚Äôve tried!! And I‚Äôve tried at least 20 different brands. I have Melasma, so I can‚Äôt even leave my bedroom without putting on sunscreen. Otherwise, my spots get darker in a matter of minutes. This has been a big problem for me for years, so I started reading a lot about sunscreens and decided that mineral ones are better for me. This one goes smoothly but dries instantly and doesn‚Äôt feel greasy. I found out that the trick is to apply a thin layer several times. This way, you avoid having white buildup on certain spots (like around your nostrils.) I recommend double cleanse at night in order to get rid of it completely.

The only zinc based sunscreen I have found that absorbs fully, doesn't go white, and isn't greasy. The zinc is also beneficial to acne sufferers, so even when my skin is angry or I'm staying inside, I use this as a daily. The tint is really unnoticeable EXCEPT it somehow manages to give you a subtle, even "good skin" kind of glow. If your skin feels greasy you probably used too much. I'm a big Paula's Choice fan but I don't hesitate to buy other brands and this one beats them all.

Easy to apply, it really does have a sheer tint to it. It won't make you look darker, it just won't look like you're wearing regular white sunscreen. I've been using this product for about 2 years, already, and so far it has been my favorite facial sunscreen. I've tried a large number of sunscreen moisturizers in the past. Really dislike all of them. Either they were too greasy, or they made my skin look like I applied a thin layer of white cream, which was pretty obvious. But this one, makes my skin look normal.  It's not oily at all and it absorbs really fast. I even apply regular moisturizer underneath from time to time during the winter, and it still won't let my skin get greasy or shiny. I have very oily, acne-prone skin, and when using this product, my skin's oil production slows down. My face doesn't get shiny fast at all, it takes almost half a day before I have to whip away the oil.

This is my one of my favorite items from Paula's Choice. It is also the best sunscreen for many reasons: 1. It has a tint to it that has the coverage of a BB cream which is pretty good if you want a little coverage also it means NO WHITE CAST. 2. It is completely matte. I have very oily skin and I have tried many other moisturizers (Cetaphil Oil Control moisturizer & Shiseido Pureness Matifying Moisturizer) that claim to be mattefying but I would still end up with oily skin by the end of the day. This matte finish last ALL DAY. 3. It has zinc oxide which means it's physical sunscreen which is better than chemical sunscreens if your skin breaks out from that. 4. Does not have that SPF smell at all.  Note: The reason I said its the best sunscreen as oppose to best moisturizer is because it does not hydrate like a moisturizer. I would definitely not recommend this for dry skin. I have combination skin so on the dry areas or when I have dry patches on my face I avoid putting this one those areas because as I've said its VERY mattefying. But if you have oily skin this should work as your morning moisturizer. I personally still put something more hydrating underneath for days when I'm feeling dry.

This works really well under makeup. The spf I was wearing underneath my makeup before was so thick it would make my makeup smear off easily throughout the day. This however, is much lighter and seems to hold moisture in without having it be heavily wet and thick feeling. I‚Äôve actually gone without having to set my foundation many days. I do wear a primer between the spf and foundation, but the difference from the one I used before is amazing. Also, tinted products can look off on me, because I have a fair completion, but it blends in smoothly without being streaky. Honestly, I‚Äôd say the tint doesn‚Äôt really do much, other than it being better than trying to rub in white spf on the face.

I love how well this product is safety sealed. I have read some great reviews about this and decided to give it a try. I have used Australian Gold tinted spf 50 in light shade for a few years now so I posted pictures of the tint shades for comparison. This PC is definitely more of a natural feel as opposed to the AG being very mattifying. I‚Äôm a combination dry skin w occasional oil on nose, so I do enjoy the more natural feel. However I still wear a lightweight moisturizer before applying any sunblock. The PC is very pale, even for my fair complexion. I have to apply a little dusting of non shimmering light colored bronzer so I don‚Äôt look ill. That‚Äôs how pale it is on my face. But if I‚Äôm wearing it under foundation that isn‚Äôt an issue. It also wears really great under foundation and acts like a primer. I will definitely finish using my tube and may purchase again because I really do love the natural finish, I only wish it didn‚Äôt look that pale so on lazy days I could wear it by itself. For reference I usually wear the second to lightest shade of any foundation.

I have very oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. This sunscreen is my holy grail. It‚Äôs amazing alone or under makeup. It stays pretty matte by itself but it really stays matte if I wear bare minerals foundation powder over top of it. Of course I still get a bit oily because that‚Äôs how my skin is but it‚Äôs noticeably less with this product. If I don‚Äôt rub it in well it does look kind of pale on my skin but it blends in really well if I rub it in pretty good. It has very very light coverage kind of like a bb cream but it‚Äôs not cakey or anything. The texture is silky smooth but not oily or heavy. I do use moisturizer before putting on this sunscreen. I will be purchasing again üíØ

I hardly ever take the time to write a review...the product is either awful or amazing if I'm going to write about it.  With that said, I have extremely oily skin. I have tried every matte (oil absorbing, etc) primer, foundation, serum, lotion, potion, promise on the market. Nothing works; not even a little. THIS PRODUCT WORKS! It keeps my oil under control. I wear it under normal foundation and my oil doesn't go crazy! Oily friends, you should try this. Dry skin may want to avoid. The tint is a little light for me but it's not an issue since I wear a light foundation over the top of it. I will be buying again and again.

I've always had very oily and sensitive skin in my teens and early 20s, now in my 30s, it can still get oily during hotter months. I was looking for something that had mattifying effect, at least spf 30 and didnt feel heavy on my skin. I absolutely adore this product, when you first put it on, it looks kinda white but it seamlessly blends into my skin giving a soft glow sheer appearance, I usually touch up with everyday minerals powder and I'm ready to go. It stays on most of the day unless I'm sweating profusely and wiping my face, then I use a back up sunscreen. This product does not break out my sensitive skin. The only downside is that is a bit expensive for the quantity, and I wish it came in bigger tubes. I usually order directly from paulas choice since they have better pricing.

Ok ladies I'm going to share a story with you regarding my experiences with sunscreens that I have experienced. First we all have spent plenty of money trying to find the one! Countless shopping reading reviews and trying & they all failed. I don't normally write reviews but I had to with this product. I have oily skin and by lunchtime I was using the blotting wipes, after purchasing this sunscreen I have no longer had to use them, finally! This sunscreen is the bomb with women who have oily skin! First it's very moisturizing and I love the matte finish and the tint. It's very light and doesn't have a smell to it & leaves zero white cast! I have sensitive skin too. The application is so easy it's blends right into your skin. I wait about 5 minutes before I apply my makeup & it blends right into your skin with zero pilling sorry don't know how to spell it. Regardless. This is worth every penny, especially for oily/combo skin. I'm over the moon with this product..it rubs in perfectly after applying your moisturizer and your makeup will look beautiful and no more blotting papers! Look no further you can't go wrong. I apply my makeup on in the am and in the pm my makeup looks like I just applied it. I hope this helps some women who spent Countless times and spending a lot of money with no avail. I'm so excited this works & it's anti aging which is an extra benefit! Look no further I would give it a 10 star's if I could!

I purchased this sunscreen because it was said to be great for sensitive skin and not leave a white cast like my other physical sunscreen. First of all let me say I am pretty pale. I am like a 3 in most foundations. This sunscreen definitely leaves a pale cast on my skin. Maybe it isn't white, but it's kinda pale cool pinkish? Anyway, just keep that in mind if you are hoping it will blend in seamlessly to your skin tone. However, it is much less of a cast than my previous white sunscreen, and the formula is also not as thick and sticky. I add a bit of bronzer to warm it up and make it look less pink/pale.  The first time I wore this sunscreen I went hiking, and I found my skin was burning and itching. I was lightly sweating. Something in the formula slightly irritates my skin. I have rosacea, the pink flushed kind - no bumps. I definitely felt like a rosacea flare was coming on that first day. Since then I have worn it and not experienced the itching and flush but I am wary. I believe it may have been the combination of the sunscreen with sweating and sunshine that made me itch and burn. But isn't that what sunscreen is for? To wear outside in the sun? So... I dunno.  Another thing to add is that you must vigorously mix the lotion before opening the tube. Each time. Otherwise you just get a mess. For me that means shaking it a lot and then massaging the tube to try to mix it up. A pain. My other sunscreen is the same so I guess that's just normal.  Still in search of a holy grail physical sunscreen that isn't irritating for the rosacea on my face. I've started wearing foundation as sunscreen and so far it's the best solution. It's the right color match, it is spf 20 and it is using pigments as the sunblock so it is physical sunscreen I guess? It just doesn't last that long out in the sweaty sunshine or work when going in the water.  I will not repurchase this product. Foundation works better and this is expensive!

Wow, this product is pretty amazing. I have very pale, very sensitive, combination skin (yay me!) and I have struggled for years to find something that would give me SPF coverage without causing a reaction or breakout. I also want a cruelty free, vegan, and as natural as possible of a product, so options have been limited. To think of the money I have wasted on products that not only didn't deliver what I hoped they would, but also caused more stress and damage to my skin, has made me very cautious of purchasing outside of the products I know work for me. I love Osea Malibu products, but they don't make a face lotion with SPF, or any kind of makeup. While I love Sun Bum for my body, the face lotion with SPF leaves me greasy and has caused some allergic reactions and breakouts. I thought I was doomed to be battling breakouts or worse, stuck in the shade, and then I found this beauty!  I have tried so many face lotions with SPF that either caused me to be very greasy and break out or didn't provide enough SPF coverage. This product is like a BB cream, only better. It provides you with amazing matte coverage, and after testing it in direct and very bright sunlight for 30 minutes I can attest that the SPF does indeed provide good protection. And best of all, no breakouts since I started using it about a week ago. I know my skin, and if I did have an issue with this product it would have shown up right away.  For those with combination and oily complexions this product should work really well. For those with dryer skin, you might need a more sufficient moisturizer before applying this product. The matte finish is amazing. I tend to get a little greasy in my T-zone, especially my forehead and nose, and this stuff keeps me shine free.  This product does have a tint to it, but don't be worried, it's not very pigmented. I was worried the color would be too dark for my pale skin, but it blends in really well. In the morning I wash my face, apply toner, serum or treatments, moisturizer along my cheeks and any dry areas, then this Paula's Choice RESIST matte finish tinted moisturizer and my face looks flawless. I don't like to wear face makeup so this product provides the perfect amount of coverage and if I need to I can apply a little concealer to cover the occasional blemish or any redness. Boom, good to go.  The price of this product seems pretty par for the course. I'm not sure I would pay more than $50 for it, but I feel like the $33 price tag was totally worth it. This product isn't super clean, but it's way better than most, and cruelty free! Paula's Choice notes that while their products do not contain animal products, they cannot be labeled vegan because the equipment used to make their products does process other labels that use animal products. So basically they are vegan, but cannot be labeled as such.  Dear Paula's choice, please don't stop making this lotion! I am loving what it's doing for my skin :)

I suffer from oily, OILY skin. It's so bad I have to use a moist rag at home or Chipotle's napkins out in public (I love their napkins, it doesn't leave behind fuzzy clumps and it absorbs the oils better than brands). It doesn't help that I live in North TX where 8 out 12 months the weather is humid, and summers are sweat-inducing hot. To make matters worse, I suffer from hormonal acene (I'm in my mid-20s, so I'm past puberty) and my skin is sensitive. I've spent plenty of money on foundations and matte and moisturizers (for oily skin) and, despite all their claims, by 12 or as early as 11, my face is a melting, shiny mess. I searched online for the best products for all my needs and Paula's Choice was listed. I hadn't realize I got the matte product until I squeezed it out. I was furious with myself because I've had negative experiences with these type of products. For a month I didn't wear it until I ran out of my usual moisturizer and decided to give this a try. By the end of the day I was converted. I've been using it since then. It stays on strong thru all weather and hormonal episodes. It covers my acene scars, the acene itself (but to an extent) without irritating it, dark spots, doesn't exaggerate my pores (you still need to know how to apply it right or risk making your pores more visible) and evens my tone. I still get oily but its bearable and less noticeable and takes longer to develop compared to other foundations I used. My only issuse with it is the skin tone. Despite its claim for being all skin tones, that's a lie. I'm a light-skin Mexicana but my skin isn't pink like the product. And it's obvious against my pale, yellowish chest. But as some suggested, apply makeup on top of it and you'll look good, maybe. I don't use makeup due to lack of time and I've yet to find a foundation that matches my type of light skin. All in all, this product is the holy grail for acene-sufferes and oily-prone skin. I highly recommend for those with dry skin NOT to buy this product.

I heard about this product from a YouTube video on makeup application. The woman said that it is great under makeup as a base layer for those who need extra coverage and sun protection, and that is it best for those with cool skin tones. That got my attention because most products look very yellow or orange on me. I love this stuff. It is very moisturizing but doesn‚Äôt make me break out. It feels great on my skin. Really nice weekend coverage or under my regular foundation for work. And it has no yellow or orange tones at all, so perfect if like me you are very pink and cool in tone. I just love it, have been using it for about a year now and use it daily.

Absolute best sunscreen for everyday men. Applies very light and easy. Also great for traveling although I'd prefer a bigger 4oz size. No aggressive rubbing necessary and does not get caught in facial hair creating embarrassing flakes. Don't worry about the tint it's so subtle that it doesn't rub off on whites.

If money is no object, this is a great product. It works well both alone and under makeup. It's not oily, but it also isn't drying. Often, when I see something marketed as oil-free or non-greasy, I find the products are drying. Not so with this sunscreen. It goes on very smooth. It's best to put it on after washing and moisturizing (it's not a moisturizer), and then let it set up for 10-20 min. When I'm in a time crunch, I sometimes don't wait, and it's ok, but it's definitely more ideal to let it set and then I can apply my makeup without having the sunscreen move around or interact with the makeup. My makeup looks very nice over this, and it doesn't feel heavy. Here's the order of my routing: wash, pat dry, serum(s), moisturizer, sunscreen, wait about 15 min, then a primer followed by makeup.  There are 2 drawbacks: first, it's not cheap. I also like EltaMD UV Physical for a lot less $$ per oucne, but the EltaMD doesn't dry down as completely, so a little more challenging under makeup. Second, it's an SPF 30, whereas the EltaMD UV Physical is SPF 41. I do prefer that the Paula's Choice is all Zinc Oxide and no titanium dioxide.

This has become my holy grail, daily facial sunscreen and I‚Äôve tried them all. It‚Äôs geared toward normal to oily skinned people but I have very dry skin and love it. While it‚Äôs not a super hydrating formula, it‚Äôs also not drying. I wear a light moisturizer underneath. When first applied it has a slight greasy look but within 5 minutes it dries down matte. It wears very well under liquid foundation and even makes my makeup last longer. I have fair/light Caucasian skin with a warm undertone, and the tint works great on me even though it looks cool toned out of the bottle. I can wear it without makeup and it dries almost invisible, evening out my skin tone. Darker completed people may not be able to wear this on it‚Äôs own. If I could change anything, I wish it were 50 spf instead of 30, and I wish it came in a bigger bottle. However, it‚Äôs a mineral sunscreen so it isn‚Äôt degrading over the course of the day in the same way some chemical sunscreens do, so I know I‚Äôm getting good protection. I‚Äôve never burned or got pink wearing this, even when I‚Äôm out in the sun for an extended time. It is not water proof though, so not suitable for swimming. Love that it has antioxidants and resveratrol. Worth the money in my opinion.

I am 53 and wear sunscreen religiously. It's just become part of my daily skincare routine and slather it on, even if I am staying indoors. My "go to" for years has been the Australian Gold tinted face sunscreen and it's worked really well, but I was curious about the Paula's choice and like it so much better. My "wants" in face sunscreen are that it needs to have some tint, blend well, soak into the skin relatively quickly, and work well under foundation, using it almost like a primer. The Paula's choice ticks all those boxes. I do not have oily skin, but rather combination and have found it works well for me, even though I am not super oily. It works well under liquid foundation, under BB and CC cream, and powder foundation. Will purchase again and again. My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a bigger tube.

I have been using this product for YEARS! I have ipsy and I get a ton of spf primers to try and I ALWAYS come back to my PC one. Recently, I had an issue with my PC account on their website and it was taking to long to work through customer service to restore my access so now I just buy from here. I have only received it once through Amazon but the product is just like I'm used to.  I'm 43 and people constantly tell me I look nothing close to my age- SUNSCREEN FOLKS! I'm a natural ginger and I have had some skin cancer (it runs in the family) so I am always sure to wear some sort of spf on exposed parts. This works as a great primer under my makeup.  When I get out of the shower I use a little bit of moisturizer allow it to dry, add my PC primer and allow it to dry and then apply makeup. I will also use this alone when I don't need a full face - I'm a bit pale so it works well with my skin color so I can't speak for anyone else in that regard.

Due to the Resveratrol this can be a bit drying on normal or combination skin so I'd definitely recommend using a good moisturizer in addition to the sunscreen. For me with drier skin, it was not at all moisturizing (I don't think it's really meant to be), but it works very well for sun protection. It also helped to even out my skin a bit and smooth lines very slightly after about two months of regular use. Again with the Resveratrol, it can be a bit irritating for extra sensitive skin. Most days I can use it without problems but in the colder months I did experience some additional drying out/dry patches. As for summer, I've had zero dryness issues and love using it. Overall and for the right skin type I would recommend it.

I have very finicky skin that breaks out from products that are considered "safe" for sensitive skin. Moisturizers are a very difficult product for me to find without having a lot of skin irritation and break outs. Finally I can stop searching for a daily sunscreen! This is my holy grail. My skin loves it, it doesn't break me out and I actually see improvement in my skin. The moisturizer is tinted, however the tint disappears into my skin and doesn't appear to actually reduce any redness or imperfections. That doesn't bother me because I really just wanted a good physical sunscreen that wasn't greasy and didn't break me out. This product is mattifying as stated in the product description. It doesn't dry out my skin (combination) but I would be cautious if you do have dry skin. This product does help keep my T zone from getting greasy in the summer heat.  Excellent product, will definitely buy it again. I hope they never stop making it!

I used to be oily, had acne, now that I'm in my mid 40's I can't hardly buy a pimple (not that I would ha)- I'm not overly dry but dang it, aging is a concern. My skin is a bit sensitive, and evidently I have some type of DNA makeup that doesn't always do well with moisturizers or more precisely with primers. I've had several in the past that I would best describe as they never soaked into my face fully, just felt like they sat on top of my skin. I could literally barely rub my face and it would rub off (ball up) like you were removing rubber cement from something. Anyway, this stuff is one of my favorite products- it soaks in, leaves a silky softness, blurs (I need some with my mild acne scarring from days of yore), provides spf. Love it. I wear it under my makeup but even on the days I don't wear makeup I can still feel much much much better about the looks of my skin with just the slight blur it gives my skin. Don't change this formula on me or I will have to hunt someone down. :P

52 and still have oily/combo skin. This has just the right amount of coverage to not look caked on but also corrects slight redness. Almost dewey without looking oily. Add some concealer in trouble spots and it‚Äôs perfect. Lasts all day‚Ä¶feels weightless. Love it.

I absolutely love this sunscreen! It has a very mattifying effect on the skin so I prefer to layer it on top of a serum because it feels a bit drying if I don't use anything underneath. I actually like this aspect because I can use a serum during the day and then put this on top to reduce shininess. I do think this would be too mattifying for anybody with dry skin. It works well under makeup and doesn't cause pilling with the other products that I currently use. I highly recommend this sunscreen!

Okay, I hate how expensive it is, but I absolutely LOVE this product. It‚Äôs like a 2-in-1 sunscreen and shine control. My face is like a disco ball, but when I apply this stuff, it seriously goes to work controlling the shimmer and shine. It feels like nothing on my face and it provides great protection from the sun. My face has never been burned using this stuff. Will definitely be adding this to my budget.

Love this moisturizing tinted sunscreen. Does not clog my pores of aggravate my acne prone skin. Goes on well. Does transfer to clothes, unfortunately, but does not stain. After washing the clothes the tint washes away. Been using it for about 4 years and it‚Äôs the only physician sunscreen with a tint that I like.

Absolutely love this product! It‚Äôs one of my essentials so I won‚Äôt leave the house without it - especially during the summertime. It‚Äôs light enough to feel airy, yet thick enough to provide some subtle tinted coverage that blends beautifully. More importantly, it doesn‚Äôt clog or irritate my acne prone skin. Additionally, the product always arrives sealed and in excellent condition. Overall, I highly recommend - especially if you have acne prone and/or reactive skin. My only complaint is the low SPF (only 30). I wish they made the exact same product but with SPF 60+!!

This is by far my favorite facial sunscreen. I wear it under makeup and most of the time as a foundation. I use the Normal + Oily Combination formula. It‚Äôs not really moisturizing, but that‚Äôs not what I am looking for. It goes on evenly, giving your skin a little bit of finish. A lot of other tinted facial sunscreens are way to dark for me, as I am very fair. Goes on sheer, covers evenly and dries to a natural Matt finish.

This wonder feels so good and does everything it claims to. It's light coverage but if you don't want to add a regular foundation on top, just add more for the coverage you need. I have been a cosmetic junkie for 50+ years and have had the good fortune to be able to buy whatever the industry comes up with...you would laugh if you could see all my products. :) Anyway...this is what I use every single day. I absolutely LOVE it. Paula...you are simply in a league of your own! KL

I can not use any type of chemical sunscreen on my face or I break out. This works very well for me because it uses zinc oxide. It is light weight and helps even out my skin tone. I touch it up with spot concealer, light face powder and blush. Very happy with this product.

I've tried many physical (mineral) sunscreens that do not work for my skin. This one is the best!!! Plus it has a slight color to help with preventing white cast. I have a slight olive Asian complexion. It does not make my skin look oddly pale while it also doesn't cover up anything like a true BB cream or foundation does. This is a benefit for me because my skin doesn't break out from it as opposed to real makeup. I reapply it a few times a day and still look fine, my face isn't dried out or clogged. However I do feel it on my face, as it's got a slightly sticky feel. I don't mind it because it doesn't move around on the face. If I put a finger to it, I don't see a smudge print. My face looks even and slightly matte throughout the day with multiple layers of it on. I will purchase more of this again. This is my favorite sunscreen now!

I repeat, hallelujah! I've struggled to find a tinted spf moisturizer that works with my combination, more oily, acne-prone skin. I prefer a light texture that mattifies and still provides decent sun protection. I love not looking greasy now after a 9 hour nursing shift. This one checks all the boxes for me. Not badly priced either. :)

This is the first time I've purchased the product on Amazon, but I've been buying and using it for years. I'm 42 and have light, cool-toned skin. I use this product most mornings as a moisturizer and foundation substitute. It blends very well with my skin tone, evens me out, and hides minor imperfections. I use a mineral powder with some SPF after I apply this product. It does an okay job in the summer for sun protection, however I wouldn't rely solely on it for extensive sun exposure and protection. I have combination skin and find it works well to regulate my oily areas. This product works really well for me and so far I've been unable to find a comparable daytime moisturizer/foundation product. It's worth a try!

I love this product! I will continue to buy it. I have been looking for something like this for many years. It's perfect. I bought the small bottle to try before buying the large one of course. I'm sold. My skin looks perfect when it's on. I have skin protection and no break outs. I'm very happy. Great product! Doesn't turn orange, doesn't dry my skin out. I love it. So does my 11 year old daughter.

Looooooove this mineral sunscreen for my oily skin! It‚Äôs definitely worked the best among the others I‚Äôve tried as far as oil control goes. And with the tint, gives me a little spread of even color. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with my sensitive skin or noticed acne popping up due to this product. I will say that it seems a little difficult to spread evenly since it‚Äôs liquidy. It spreads really well, but I have to give it time to dry a little before I feel like it‚Äôs well balanced on my face if that makes sense. Will continue purchasing for sure!!

I was surprised at how small the bottle is. However, a little goes a long way. This SPF is AMAZING! I have light medium skin and it blends seamlessly. PROS: It is not greasy at all Very lightweight No fragrance Non-comogenic Does not leave a white cast No pilling Very smooth texture Leaves skin with a healthy glow Safe for acne prone skin  CONS: Price Size  I would definitely buy this product again, even if I wished it were cheaper. But you know what they say: you get what you pay for. Paula's Choice is definitely a brand worth every dollar!

This product is awesome and saves me time. I have worn sunblock on my face for many years as part of the daily routine and recently made the switch to zinc sunblocks because of some research showing possible carcinogenic ingredients in the usual sunblocks. However, most zinc sunblocks make my already pale skin look even more ghost-like. This sunblock has a nice tint to it, though, and does a genuinely good job protecting and tinting. I previously never left the house without a light coat of foundation powder on my face. I am now skipping that step in my daily routine!

I love this stuff! Finally, a sunscreen I can use that doesn't burn, sting, or make me very oily. The tint is just enough to mask the whiteness of the zinc oxide, but it still looks natural on me. I don't wear a lot of makeup, so it works well for me. I am pale and this matches my skin tone, so for those who are darker complected, this may be too light for you.

I was so pleasantly surprised by the sunscreen. I originally bought it to mix it with another one to make it a little lighter, as the other one was a dark tint. I quickly started using only this one because it goes on so smoothly, no irritation at all because it‚Äôs mineral, works fine for eyelids, under eyes, etc. It works beautifully under make up as well. I love this product!

Most face sunblocks I use make my eyes cry - even though I never applied it near my eyes. My cheeckbones is as far as I get when applying sunblock. This Paula's choice resist however, can get right around the eye with no irritation! It can be worn on it's own - meaning without make up. I do like to combine it with EltaMD UV Elements Tinted Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 44 .....just becuase this one is a bit darker tint. Between the both they make a perfect color match for me! Angie from the channel Hot & Flashy recommended this product. Great one!

I love this product which has replaced my foundation. At age 67 I was looking for a natural looking foundation with sun protection that wasn‚Äôt too drying. This is it! I do not have any sensitivity to it. It goes on smooth and evenly. I love how I can add powder, blush and bronzer to it afterwards and be ready to go in a few minutes. I hope they don‚Äôt discontinue this - it‚Äôs my holy grail!

I have struggled with oily, shinning skin for so long and although I've tried many and various types of SPF creams and/or moisturizers with SPF (as I NEED the sun protection) all the products I have tried continue to have some kind of "greasy" feel, or only works for a limited time (an hour or so) and then the shiny greasy appearance and feel comes back. I have very fair Asian skin that also darkens quickly and easily with melasma and freckles from minimal sun exposure. This is the first product that I've been (surprisingly) pleasantly pleased with. It really does leave your face with a matte finish that lasts for hours, and most importantly, does not leave your face with an oily, shiny residue, so with the SPF protection as well,..I love it! I know that I have finally found a product that I will use for years to come!

Best tinted sunscreen I have found yet. I have tried numerous brands including Elta MD, and always seem to come back to this one. I wish it had a little more zinc in it to bump up the SPF. If I feel like I need more sunscreen protection, I brush a sunscreen powder over this one to give it a boost. The translucent tint is perfect for my light skin tone and the texture is wonderful. It glides on effortlessly and leaves my combination skin looking matte all day. My skin is acne prone and I haven't had any issues with break outs. Thank you Paula's Choice for making such a wonderful product!

Did you know they recommend a freaking teaspoon of sunscreen for face and neck application?? Okay, I am def not using that much but close, and I need to not feel oily or look like an Asian Casper. This is it! The tint really helps and after I massage it thoroughly in I can‚Äôt tell I have anything on. I also have oily skin so I need something that is truly lightweight and doesn‚Äôt turn me into a grease pit and again, this is it. Love it!

I really like all Paula‚Äôs Choice products. This moisturizer is better suited for combination to oily skin as it is slightly mattifying. I have rosacea and this is the first moisturizer I can use (especially in the summer) that does not cause my skin to break out. Very light and not greasy if you use a small amount. I don‚Äôt really notice that the tint does anything, however. Maybe slightly evens out tone.

First off, I‚Äôm pretty pale. Usually the second the lightest shade in foundations and this is still light enough to work. If you‚Äôre the same, you do see a little color difference but nothing crazy. It also holds up with my extremely oily skin really well too surprisingly, especially if you top it with a matte powder. Coverage is decent too, you can still definitely see skin but your skin tone is overall more corrected. My only gripe with it is that it starts to smell weird on the skin after a while but it‚Äôs all good with me. I‚Äôm sticking with this sunscreen for a very long time.
