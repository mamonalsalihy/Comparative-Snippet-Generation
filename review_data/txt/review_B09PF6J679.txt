This is a review of the "Coppertone Pure and Simple Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen Spray + Stick Sunscreen SPF 50, Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Sunscreen Pack (5 Oz Spray + 0.49 Oz Stick)".  This sunscreen is free of oxybenzone, octinoxate, PABA, parabens, phthalates, dyes, and fragrances. My daughter will sometimes break out in rashes after using certain sunscreen products, so we have been sticking with the Zinc Oxide ones as those tend not to bother her, so when I saw a Coppertone one, I knew I had to pick this up!  It's SPF50. It does leave a bit of a white sheen on skin, but when it comes to sun safety, it's all about being safe, not how you look. It's rated to be water resistant for 80 minutes, but I still reapply closer to the hour mark just to be safe. I find that the stick is really nice for faces, my daughter always hates getting spray near her face and the stick completely removes that battle from our sun care routine!  The only downside to this is that it's expensive. As of my writing this pack of spray+stick is $17, which is on the high side for sure. If you can get past the cost, I would highly recommend.

This review is for the Coppertone Pure and Simple Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen Multi Pack, SPF 50 Spray Sunscreen + Sunscreen Stick, Hypoallergenic, Facial & Body Sunscreen, 5 Oz & 49 Oz. For effective and trusted sunscreen protection, Coppertone has been a well-known and respected brand for decades. This particular SPF 50 spray and stick pack of sunscreen protection is exactly what you would expect from Coppertone. What is different about it compared to most of their other products is that this one incorporates natural Zinc Oxide for protection, which is a great ingredient. But do be aware the Zinc Oxide in this product will leave a slight white looking sheen appearance on the skin, and will not be clear looking like the other non-Zinc Oxide formulations. This should not be an issue at all for young kids or adults with very light skin tones.  Great product and great protection from the Sun.

I love mineral sunscreen because it doesn’t contain all the harsh chemicals that regular sunscreen does. Whether you buy into all of that or not, this works just as well, so why take the risk? I worked in my garden for 2 hours on a hot and sunny afternoon, and did not burn. This held up well through the dirt, sweat, and grime. Coppertone is a trusted brand, and one of my go-tos for sunscreen. This was lightweight and not too greasy on my skin. I really like the bonus mini stick for your face. So much easier to use than the spray on the face. Sometimes stick sunscreens leave a burning sensation on my skin, but I had no issues with this one.

This Coppertone Pure and Simple Sunscreen spray and stick set is the perfect delicate protectant for my family’s sensitive skin.  The lightweight spray is easy to apply, free of harmful chemicals and it’s also water resistant. I love how I conveniently carry the fragrance free SPF 50 sunscreen stick infused with cocoa butter in my purse to use as needed. More importantly, this broad spectrum sunscreen with zinc oxide is hypoallergenic so it’s gentle on my family’s skin while providing the sun protection that we need while outdoors.  Coopertone is definitely our family’s favorite sunscreen as it’s a well-known, trusted brand.

Coppertone is my go to brand for sunscreen. Coppertone pure and simple is perfect for using on my toddler. The stick works phenomenally on my toddlers face. No worries about spraying it in her eyes or runoff in her eyes. It protects her face from sunburn and seems to last a lot longer than lotion. It holds up well in the water too. The spray works great for the rest of her little body. The spray nozzle sprays with ease, no clogs or issues like some off brand spray nozzles. Grab this set and you’re good to go with your littles.

It takes forever for me to received this, but the product itself is great. I have a big family with 6 kids, and we are in the pool at least 3 times a week for the summer. We use a lot of sunscreen. Coopertone is always my first choice when it comes to sunscreen. I use the stick for the face and spraying bottle for the body. They are SPF50 and they work great. I have sensitive skin and both stick or spray didn't irritated me. It offers great protection and it is easy to spreading.

My daughter has very sensitive skin so the more natural products I can use on her, the better. This Coppertone Pure & Simple goes on white and blends very easily. It offers water resistant protection for 80 minutes. My daughter has not experienced any irritation since using.

Great SPF 50 sunscreen. I'm so pale, that's like the bare minimum I use. Love that this comes with both a spray and a stick. The stick is a perfect size to stick in a purse or a backpack.
