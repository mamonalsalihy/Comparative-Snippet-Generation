I really like the combo of the spray and face lotion for protecting the kids from sunburns. I know they say anything over a 30spf isn’t doing much but it’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially against the strong Florida sun. We use the spray for their bodies because they prefer it over lotion they have to rub in. They don’t like using lotion for their bodies because they say it makes them feel oily and then the beach sand sticks all over them. The downside to using a spray is that it’s easy to miss parts, especially if the wind catches it when you’re spraying. Just make sure you rub it in after you spray and it helps hit all the spots.  I do like that this came with a separate bottle of face lotion though. We don’t spray their faces in case it gets in their eyes so usually we use regular lotion or one of those sticks. This lotion is creamy and applies nicely to the face to make sure we cover everywhere. We also apply the face lotion to the ears and on top of their heads if there’s any spots that will see the Sun.  We have been using coppertone for years and I know it’s a product we can trust. I like the combination bundle of the spray and the lotion. These will be perfect for the beach, pool, soccer games, and any other outdoor activities.

The Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Spray + Face Sunscreen in SPF 50 is an excellent sunscreen set that will effectively protect the family's skin. The sunscreen sprays out very evenly, feels lightweight on the skin, and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy or heavily coated. It comes out in a very fine mist and doesn't require any rubbing in. I applied it to my kids and myself during an afternoon out and we didn't have any issues with burns, redness, or irritation. The set also comes with a small bottle of sunscreen lotion for easy application on the face, neck, and ears. The lotion is creamy and is easy to spread on without having to spend a lot of time rubbing it in to ensure there are no white streaks on your skin. The sunscreens are nonirritating and I liked how it stayed in place even though a lot of sweat - none of our family had sunscreen sweat get into our eyes causing stinging and tearing. Like most sports sunscreens, there is a definite scent to the sunscreen, although it's not particularly strong or overbearing. Overall, it's a great sunscreen set that will make applying sunscreen to your family a quick and easy process. It protects skin effectively and is great for carrying in your bag for those long, sunny days outside.

We are trying to use fewer chemicals on our bodies and also trying to only use mineral sunscreen when we go in the ocean. I was pleased to see that Coppertone came out with a mineral-based sunscreen for the face. This set is a great combination of being able to use the spray for larger parts of the body and the minerals face cream for the face.  We like the feel of the lotion, it feels clean and not oily. It leaves almost a matte finish on your skin.  The lotion seems to protect really well and with SPF 50 I feel comfortable on even the brightest day.  The spray is the one that we have been using for years and is my standard go-to every summer and for every vacation.  Overall very happy with the "Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Spray + Face Sunscreen SPF 50, Water Resistant Sunscreen Pack, Spray Sunscreen and Facial Sunscreen Lotion (5.5 Oz Spray + 2.5 Fl Oz Tube)". I love the combination pack.

The face sunscreen lotion is excellent. It’s a mineral sunscreen, and once you try mineral sunscreens it is hard to go back. It doesn’t have the typical sunscreen smell, and I can apply it to my nose and on my cheeks under my eyes without causing any eye irritation. It does take a little bit of massaging to work it in, but once it’s on, it’s much more comfortable to me than the other non-mineral facial sunscreen I have. I’ve been using it for ~3 hour bike rides and it seems to have no trouble lasting despite tons of sweat.  The body spray sunscreen is also good, but a lot more like other body spray sunscreens I’ve used before. I’ve personally found spray sunscreen most useful for days at the pool, when you just need a ton of coverage. For other uses, it’s hard to control exactly where it goes, and so I personally prefer a lotion or stick.  Overall a great value for a 2-pack of sunscreen.

Coppertone has built a name that speaks for itself. Some off brands or store brand sprays don’t spray as nicely and get clogged. Coppertones spray can works very well. Nice even spray coming out the can and no clogging. I trust this sunscreen to protect my family and I from the sun while at the beach or a normal day outside playing. The face lotion being included as a set is super convenient. My kids won’t let the spray can near their face so I appreciate this as a parent. Some things you go with the brand you trust and that’s how I feel about Coppertone sunscreen.

Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Spray, SPF 50 Spray Sunscreen, 5.5 Oz and Sport Mineral Face Lotion, SPF 50 Sunscreen, 2.5 Fl Oz  I ordered the Coppertone Sport Sunscreen for my sons and husband who works outdoors. They really detest typical sunscreens but I can get them to wear the Sport variety because it doesn’t run and doesn’t get into their eyes. The Coppertone Sport Sunscreen is great quality and works really well. This also comes with the Sport Mineral Face Lotion is oil free and doesn’t run in the eyes either.  ⛵⚓Seas the Day⚓⛵

This sun block sprays on easily, and stays on, even in the water. Not really sure how to gauge the effectiveness, but I did not get a sun burn, while being on the beach for about an hour; so I feel it worked really well.  What really sell this brand to me though is the nostalgic smell that reminds me of the smell of going to the beach as a kid. Not really sure what the scent is supposed to be, but I love it.

I love that this pack comes with both a spray and a cream. I am not a fan of using the spray around my face so having the cream come with it is great. My kids had a full day of hot sun with no sunburns, so I would say this pack is great!

We always trust Coppertone when purchasing SPF. We live at the beach and go through a LOT of sunscreen. We love the spray can for ease of use and we avoid rubbing sand all over our bodies when trying to rub in lotion. Reed friendly, which is always important. I like the mineral face SPF because it’s a lighter, more sensitive product meant for facial skin. It doesn’t make my break out and keeps my face protected from harsh rays.

- it came with spray for body and cream for the face - as per our experience effective for sunscreen protection - I liked mineral ingredients - comfortable to use

Coppertone is a familiar name. And this sunscreen purports SPF 50, the veracity of which I've no way of determining. And I've read that anything above 30 isn't necessary as "UVB protection does not increase proportionally with the SPF number". It also states that this sunscreen protects from 98% of UV rays. However, it doesn't specify which type of UV rays. And there's a warning not to use near heat, flame, or when smoking. It's coupled with a Sport Mineral "FACE 50" of 100% naturally sourced zinc oxide, which reflects and scatters UV rays and purportedly protects from premature aging.

I have used the Coppertone Sport sunscreen many times and already knew I liked it, so when I came across this set I figured it would be worth a try.  This Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Spray + Face Sunscreen SPF 50 comes with exactly what it says, one Sport body sunscreen and one cream face sunscreen. The body spray works just as well as it has every year for both me and the kids, it offers adequate protection and it’s not super greasy like some others.  This was my first time trying the face cream. While it wasn’t horrible and I will still use it, it also wasn’t my favorite. It did leave a more greasy feel to my face and I felt like my pores were super clogged after use.

I love the face mineral sunscreen. It does leave a white cast, which I'm not sure there's much of a way around unless you go with the tinted mineral sunscreens. I like how it's fragrance free and it's easy to apply. I tend to apply sunscreen really close to my eyes, and the claim that it doesn't run into the eyes is accurate!  My skin didn't experience any irritation from the face sunscreen. I do need to use a separate moisturizer, but I don't mind that. Other than the white cast I have no complaints.  The SPORT sunscreen smelled really strong to me. It's the classic sunscreen fragrance that maybe other people are okay with, but I can't stand it.

If you have to use a spray, the Coppertone is fine. You'll end up wasting half of it during application, but it's definitely quicker than lotions and without the mess on your hands. The real annoying thing is when people use the sprays in public without consideration for the people around them. Inhaling the spray is bad for you, which should be obvious.  The face lotion is nice and doesn't go on too white. It is a little runny, though, so you may accidentally squeeze out more than you need and go through the tube quickly. All in all, though, this is a nice set and after a handful of uses so far, I can report that I'm sunburn free.

Good duo set for face and body sunscreen. It always drives me crazy seeing parents spray the sunscreen directly on to their kids face. Irritating to the eyes and not good to inhale. This set makes it so you have both types of sunscreen in hand. A traditional cream style for the face and spray for the body. Spray worked well, needs to be rubbed in to the body or you will get burnt in lines between the sprays. Face cream went on thick and took awhile to absorb. It was a little irritating to my rosacea but not terrible. Reapplied every 90 mins and it worked well.

We always use Coppertone Sports line, and this Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Spray + Face Sunscreen SPF 50 is a good combination. The spray is easy for someone who doesn't have patience to apply the cream. The zinc oxide face cream may not be to everyone's liking, as it's the classic thick white cream that is both hard to apply and difficult to remove. Both protect well. The zinc oxide does it without any additional chemicals. Choose what works for you, but make sure you protect your skin and your family's! Great product! Highly recommend!!

Not much to say other than this dtuff works. As a florida girl im not stranger to summer sun burns and this set keeps my skin safe all year long. I love the spray application of the body tube and i love the light texture of the face cream but best of all my skin is protected! Always remember to reapply often especially after getting wet!

This set is perfect for my husband. He can't use face sticks because his stubble/beard just shreds them. The liquid he can easily rub in. The continuous spray goes on clear (unlike the mineral spray we use on the kids), so he can easily spray the back of his neck and arms while at work.

Other screens blast out all the suncreen with high pressure. This is nice and even, the spray is a perfect mist. I won't buy others. Use this for working outside and surfing!
