I have dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin, and need to use physical (mineral) sunblocks every day (so only Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide as the active ingredients). My problem with most of them is they tend to dry my skin out after one or two uses, and that causes breakouts for me. This is the first one that's worked for me since my old fav changed their formula. There's gonna be a white cast at first, but it doesn't last (on me, at least, although I'm pale to begin with), and the shine also fades quickly.  And the color changing cap is actually kind of awesome! Out of curiosity, I took it around with me to confirm places that do/don't have UV exposure, and was surprised at how often I was wrong! Being near just about any window caused the cap to turn some shade of blue, which was a good reminder that I need to be wearing this more often, and not just when I go outside. I've been burned on overcast days, so I wasn't surprised that clouds provide no protection, and this confirmed it. (It's clever really, incentivizing the use of the product.)

this product has little to no scent, which is perfect. i’ve tried their other tube that was purple/blue for sensitive skin and it dried my skin out esp with winter! this one does NOT! if anything it leaves an oily residue, however my combo skin hasn’t gotten too irritated/oily. i don’t mind it for winter, but if you wear makeup daily or have oily skin this may not be a good fit for you. also this is NOT a gel in the 3 oz size, so buy the 5 oz and save the money. i got the 3 oz for $10 hoping it was a gel formula but it’s like normal sunscreen. it has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide - two safe sunscreens(low blood toxicity and no hormone disruption through absorption).

I need to wear screen on my nose every frikkin day due to a few cancer spots, and I cannot tolerate ANY smelly lotion, yuk. I cannot detect any odor, smell or fragrance at all with Blue Lizard Sunscreen Sensitive Gel, Spf 30+ for Skin, 3 Oz. I have been wearing it all day- no smell. Also goes on easy, doesn't feel greasy and if you rub it in, no white is visible at all. I think I will leave it a little white though for better protection and no one sees me here at home anyway. Try this sunscreen you will be very happy with it I am sure.

Purchased for my Mexico trip and worked perfectly. I told my friends and family to purchase it as well and they had no issues either. I have very sensitive skin and was able to use it on my face without breaking out or getting red. This is my new face sunscreen for daily use. After the new research came out about the chemicals that stay in our systems longer than thought, I had to find a sunscreen that was good for my body and this is it!!! No bad chemicals that can affect our health and it works perfectly. So grateful I found this!!!

I tried a lot of different reef safe sunscreens before deciding that this one is the one for me. I didn't burn after using this was my number 1. It was easy to spread and the white cast disappeared if you rubbed it in for a while (I am pale, so not sure if it would do the same for darker skin tones).  It was one of the only physical sunscreens that didn't break me out when using it on my face. However, it did leave a slightly oily sheen. If I wasn't using at the beach I would probably use powder to negate this.  I've tried some physical sunscreens that were a LOT more expensive, and overall this one was the best. Definitely recommend!

For those concerned mommies: this is a GOOD sunscreen. Most negative reviews are white caste and ease of spreading. In my opinion, it’s not that hard to spread. And once spreaded, there’s minimal white-ness. I have light brown toned skin, and after a couple of minutes it sets in no problem. Greasy? Not really. Again, after 5minutes, it just feels like I have lotion on. I bought this worrying about some negative comments, but compared to others I have tried, this is a win-win!

This product has made a huge difference in my life and saved my 10 day vacation in the sun. I break out with others even clinique. This sunsreen enabled me to avoid sunburn without breaking out. Hooray

I really love this sunscreen! Truly blocks the sun with a physical block.  Blue Lizard is easy to spread and stay on. It also gives a glow to your skin. I spread this on my face, and then apply a shade darker foundation, since the sunscreen gives a white cast.  Using this daily has really prevented dark spots and sun damage from accumulating. I apply retin-a creams at night, which make skin sensitive to the sun. This sunscreen makes sure my skin isn’t damaged during the day.  I am so happy to find Blur Lizard as I have tried so many brands. Other physical sunscreen brands are too thick and don’t spread. And most brands are a chemical sunscreen, which can make my skin darker and get sun damaged instead of protecting my skin.

i went out to the lake and only put this sunscreen on my face one time at the very beginning and my entire body was burnt to a crisp like emergency room burnt but my face was not even red!! love this stuff ! worth the price my dermatologist recommended to me for my rosacea

I was making a chnage in my skin care routine and need a new sunscreen. I have oily and acne prone skin. This was a recommendation from skin care by Hyram and I love it. It doesn't break me out. It spreads easily over the skin. I use this every morning on my face. I love it and highly recommend it if you're looking for a new sunscreen for your face or body.

I do not mind paying extra for this sunscreen. It protects me better than any other product that I have used and it does not have harmful ingredients.

I use this for moisturizer & sunscreen. It is REAL Thick! I put water on one hand before putting it on so it spreads a little easier & soaks in faster.

eos-eos

Great Thick unfortunately But does the job and has no scent

eos-eos

This is the perfect travel sunscreen. TSA size approved, reef safe, virtually unscented, and the only thing I've ever used that completely prevented me from burning. The consistency is somewhat thick, so spread well.

My son is allergic to most sunscreens. This is the ONLY brand that works for his sensitive skin. It also works great and I never have to worry about sunburns. The cap turning blue is a nice bonus (reminds you despite it being cloudy the rays are still beaming down!). Love blue lizard and trust them!

I have rosacea and my professional suggested this product as it is a physical sunscreen as apposed to a chemical one. It is fantastic. It works as intended as long as you reapply. It is not as easy to spread as chemical sunscreen but that is just what you are going to get with this type. It isn't hard, just not quite as easy.

eos-eos

Perfect sunscreen. I used to get Vanicream but after trying this one out, it became my new favorite since it offers the same great protection from the sun without the harsh chemicals though.

I ordered this sunscreen upon the recommendation of a dermatologist. Being winter, I cannot review the effectiveness as I'm not outdoors. However it is easy to use and does not irritate my skin.

I love this product. I am confident that my family and I are well protected from the sun. Easy to see where it’s been applied so I don’t miss any areas.

Need to reapply wveey 45 minutes to an hour. Was very good on my skin, though. Easy to spread and seemed to work for a bit

A little goes a long way in application of this product. It is the best we have found for living in the Valley of the Sun, Phoenix, Arizona.

I bought this for my daughter who is a field biologist. She really likes the protection and the fact that it is a mineral sunscreen instead of a chemical one. It is reef safe. Highly recommended!

eos-eos

works for me and i have sensitive skin. the cap lights up in the sun to tell you if the uv is harmful which is cool. does melt easily so keep in a cool place or it’ll get messy but it’s sunscreen what do u expect

As a very pale person with extreme sensitive and acne-prone skin this sunscreen was savior. Has little to no fragrance, a huge bonus. A little goes quite a long way. It looks really white at first don’t be scared, once rubbed it it doesn’t look or feel too heavy or oily. It may seem pricey to some (to me as well at first) but this stuff is really great.

I wanted a mineral-based sunscreen and this is wonderful. No scent, goes on easily and not greasy, no breakouts on my face. I have a fair completion, but didn’t notice any unsightly “ghosting” like some sunscreens.

I've been searching for a while for a sunscreen that won't cause my face to start burning as soon as I sweat, and this one is the winner! Like others have said, it does leave a tinge of blue-white on your face, but it works great!

I bought this on Amazon so I could have a travel size to take with me on a plane. When we use this, we never burn as long as we apply it on a semi frequent basis.  It's easy to apply and has a nice scent.

Bleu Lizard is the best sunscreen! I have a sun allergy and it’s the only cream that is effective. I highly recommend this product.

I love this stuff! I’m a Redhead and have been using it on my pasty white self since I was a kid! 20+ years and I always come back to it!

Been useing this product for years. My son has very sensitive skin and this was recommended by his pediatrician. It's all we use and it works !!

Having a child with super sensitive skin is a nightmare during the summer. Every other sunscreen gives her horrible hives. We love our Blue Lizard. No rash, no itching and most importantly no sunburn. She’s protected. Highly recommend to other parents.

I sunburn just thinking about going out on sunny days. This product allows me to spend a day in the sun without worry. Make the first application in the morning at least a half hour before going out for best results.

I like that it’s made specifically for sensitive skin and I do feel that it works. The color changing cap is also a super cool addition.

Doesn’t leave much of a white cast, spreads in easily on face, works under makeup.

Purchased this sunscreen because it is reef friendly and UNSCENTED. Easy to apply and very effective. Thank you for making a product that I can use and is environmentally forward thinking.

Doesn’t soak in completely.

Super nice cream that blocks sun without stinging eyes!

A little goes a long way. Packaging a problem cause too much comes out and you can’t control it

Excellent protection with no irritation. My son is an avid swimmer with sensitive skin. Most sunscreen really does a number on his skin via irritation and redness.This does not.Thank you!

My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive and previously sun-damaged skin. A little goes a long, long way! You’ve really got to rub it in or you will look like Casper the Ghost, but hey your skin will be protected.

One of the first truly unscented brands. Protects well and non-greasy. Highly recommend
