This is one of two brands that I would trust to use for my child. It really is one of the safest out there and works very well. Trust me I've done a lot of research on sun screens and chemicals that goes in it.

I love that this is more of a natural product. The consistency was good. It was thin enough to spread well but not too runny which was great. I would love if it were a higher SPF. I'm not sure how well the sun protection is (compared to a nuetrogena lotion I'd been using) because I only used it a few times. So far so good.

I love blue lizard sunscreen, but I was disappointed when I realized that this presentation has a quimical barrier which I wanted to avoid.

Works great but takes alot of effort to get all the white rubbed in.

I sincerely thought I was getting a safe mineral sunscreen for my kiddos and could not find the full ingredient list. I only saw that it contained zinc oxide. It was misleading once I saw it also contained chemical sunscreen and aluminum as it’s first ingredient. I’m very disappointed.

Bought this because it was advertised as sensitive sunscreen - not true. What a waste.

Just garbage.

This is by far the best sunscreen. It’s able to protect my fair skinned children and allow them to enjoy the warm weather. The uv cap always reminds you when it needs to be applied. It’s thick but spreads well

Worked in a day of Sun at the pool for my 5 and 3 year olds. We reapplied after an hour

Nothing ruins a day on the jetski like sunblock running into your eyes and making them feel like they are on fire. Usually it would take multiple applications of eye drops, and a lot of sitting with my eyes shut, to relieve it enough to start riding again.  This summer I decided that I was going to find the sunblock that stings the least. I tried all the fancy expensive brands, and most of them were better than the normal stuff I was using before, but by far this Blue Lizard Kids sunblock is the best. It still stings but not nearly as bad, and the pain goes away without needing eye drops. I was concerned about it only being SPF 50 but that has not mattered at all, it's protection from the sun has been adequate. It seems to last most of the day without needing to be reapplied. The only drawback is that it does leave a white sheen on your skin if you don't spend a lot of time rubbing it in, but that is true of all mineral sunblocks.

Used on FL vacation for the whole family. Way much better than other previously used sunscreens from drugstores.

Both of my children had horrible reaction to thus sunscreen and other blue lizard types bought here. My younger one had severe rash on her thights and arms was unable to get picture but for my older one I did capture it she have it even on her face :( I don't know what is in it but it looks like she have a burn and it's very itchy and burning! I would not recommend it! As we stayed home for several days it become better as it was suggested by doctor! Very disappointed!!!! This brand was recommended by dermatologist!
