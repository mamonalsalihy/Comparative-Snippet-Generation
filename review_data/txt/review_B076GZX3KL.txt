NEWS ALERT J&J Recalls Aveeno, Neutrogena Spray Sunscreens  The Wall Street Journal reports that Johnson & Johnson is recalling Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores after detecting benzene, a potentially cancer-causing chemical, in some samples. J&J said that consumers should stop using and discard the spray sunscreens. The company said it also was notifying distributors and retailers to stop selling the products, and arranging for the return of the products.

This product hands-down has the best sun protection. Other brands you need to reapply often but Neutrogena even if you only put on one coat you donâ€™t get burnt. If you get in water you should reapply. My husband didnâ€™t believe me so he bought something else. He got a sunburn and I didnâ€™t.

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Full-reach Sunscreen Spray Broad Spectrum SPF 70 (also available in SPF 100) is exactly what its name states. I can easily apply without assistance and doesn't require the skills of an acrobat to reach the upper and middle back and the part of the shoulders that is exposed when wearing a tank top or racer-back top. This product feels very light weight on the skin; never oily, greasy, sticky nor cakey feeling. I spray front and back, top to bottom, then rub into my skin like a body lotion or moisturizer, There is no scent or smell and no residue transferred to clothing allowing me to dress immediately. And, the VERY BEST aspect of this product is the fact that I haven't had a sunburn since I began using it daily for the past year or so.

This brand is a Lifesaver! I was worried about the packaging the product was being shipped in. It is truly ultra sheer with full coverage and worth the price. I have extra sensitive skin. I never itch or get sun burn in the smallest areas. ðŸ˜€

Good product, good shipping. This is a good body sunscreen. Neutrogena has good prodcuts

Spray on provides even protection Great value

I saw this on tiktok and had to get it. I absolutely love it! My face and acne are not always the best so this sunscreen is amazing!

eos-eos

I like the product it has nice coverage and not too greasy

eos-eos

Good protection. Use this when we travel to Arizona and spend all day in the pool. Kid's get dark not burned.

eos-eos

I use to hate putting on sunscreen till I found this. Now I put it on all the time. It doesnâ€™t even feel like your wearing sunscreen. Itâ€™s not all greasy.

eos-eos

love this sunscreen

eos-eos

Like any sun protection when you're located in a high UV area reapply regularly. This product works and feels great on the skin. Not a strong odor so it doesn't give you a headache.

eos-eos

Great stuff. Light and sheer but gets the job done.

eos-eos

Great deal, two-pack. This is the type that my skin doc says I have to use. He requires I use it all of the time --- so, it can be pricey to do it, therefore a good price is a big thing to me.

eos-eos

Not the first time Iâ€™ve used the product & this is a great product for a terrific price.

eos-eos

I love this item I had bought it for twice. I will buy again! Generally, sunscreen is thick and heavy for me. But this item is weightless sheer mist and I can use upside down. It is very convenient.  Actually, I canâ€™t buy any other sunscreen anymore. Thank you.

eos-eos

Works great in the Arizona summers. It actually seems to help keep your skin cool while people around me are over heating

eos-eos

Been using this for a few years. Provides good lasting full coverage. New dispenser style from older container this summer. Scent a little strong.

Works great

Very good coverage. Love it!

I was very surprised to receive the package from Sam's Club and it took a week although I am a Prime member. I love the Neutrogena Sheer sunscreen product but the 3-pack comes in a sleek box and when you open the box you notice that all three cans are stuck together. Why? The company uses these really strong glue tabs to hold the cans together and you have to pull them apart with force to separate. Worse, the glue tabs stay on the cans and it took me 20 minutes with a knife to remove them.

eos-eos

I like it, I can feel that it does make a big difference versus wearing no sunscreen at all, but as for being invisible it definitely has an oily residue and I find myself just spraying it in my hands and spreading it that way because otherwise just spraying wastes so much of the product with minimal coverage that isn't even.

eos-eos

I had read reviews that the product didn't work like it had lost the aerosol in it. I noticed that if you use the long handle it doesn't always work. If you depress the button from the top (as if there were no long handle) it works just fine. I'm glad I figured that out so I didn't have to throw it away. They should make the handle out of a stiffer plastic and we probably wouldn't have this issue

I have used Neutrogena sunscreens for years without any issues. I waited patiently using other brands until the new formulation spray came out and a couple of hours after using began to have severe itching and a rash on the thinner skin areas of my body like my neck and face. I washed it off immediately but had to put steroid creams on it along wit an oral antihistamine. Not s great new version at all. I have reported to to Neutrogena

eos-eos

This product does help prevent sunburn, but working outside all day every day and having to reapply multiple times, having something that isn't greasy is important to me. This formula is greasy and stays greasy throughout the day. This pack is also quite expensive compared to other similar quality items.

eos-eos

Could have gotten a bigger size for the same price elsewhere so naturally disappointed with this purchase.

eos-eos

I purchased this because it is described as sheer and that you donâ€™t feel it on your skin. I found it to be quite greasy feeling and not at all as described.

eos-eos

It works great nice and light so you forgot you have it on,but it is a little pricey.

eos-eos

I use this product quite a bit when I go cruising. Itâ€™s easy to spray and provides good protection from the sun. I never feel sticky after applying it either. My one tip would be to have someone else apply it on your back and other hard to reach areas to ensure good coverage.

eos-eos

I don't usually write a review, but I do want to do it for this product. This product makes skin irritation ( my 2 boys got bumps all over the skin) and also makes eyes irritation. Both my boys got red irritated eyes after using it. My mother also got eyes irritation. I wish I can get a refund for it,but I threw them away. Waist of money

eos-eos

Reasonable sunscreen protection. I would have liked the product to be dry to the touch

eos-eos

Neutrogena changed the sprayer & it is IMPOSSIBLE to use. I read other complaints about it, but sadly ignored them & thought "How difficult can it be?" It's horrible & Neutrogena never should have changed the old sprayer. I used the older style for years & loved it, now I have to look for a new product. The cans with the old sprayer r available but at a ridiculous cost. NEUTROGENA I HOPE U READ THIS; DON'T FIX IT IF IT'S NOT BROKEN!!!!

eos-eos

Let me start with I buy this product in the stores all of the time and love it. I thought purchasing this sunscreen in bulk from amazon was a home run.... but 2 of the 3 bottles do not spray he sunscreen at all. Iâ€™ve tried for many days to turn the safety on and off to see if it will work but they wonâ€™t. Itâ€™s really too bad that his didnâ€™t work. Hopefully he seller sees this and makes it right.

eos-eos

I love this sunblock. It goes on smooth, good coverage, very lightweight, not sticky. The cap seems a bit cheap though and I hope it holds up.

eos-eos

1 can broke . That was a bummer. The cans that worent broken worked great

eos-eos

The sunscreen is the best. Feels great on the skin and seems to be protecting our skin. The only complaint is it does not last long. We used 1 can to cover maybe 3-4 bodies.

eos-eos

I bought this because I thought it would be a nice light sunscreen for summer but it is greasier than the sports banana boat sunblock I usually spray on my kids. Leaves a heavy coat of oil on skin and doesnâ€™t smell that great either. Sucks that it was a 3-pack and not returnable!

eos-eos

Me gusto mucho

eos-eos

Problem with this product is the spray handle. It breaks off in a golf bag or anywhere else. I ordered online, because the picture looked like the acceptable streamlined older version without the clumsy handle. Canâ€™t return this flammable item. Not happy!

eos-eos

I hate myself for buying this product. I couldn't sleep from the itching and my skin broke all over the places where I had used this product. I don't even have sensitive skin. I wish someone had told me about such horrifying side effects. I now have officially ruined my vacation plan due to the irritation, swelling, redness, rash, itching, etc. I need to see a dermatologist for this horrible product.

eos-eos

Didn't seem to protect well.
