I like the product it has nice coverage and not too greasy

This product does help prevent sunburn, but working outside all day every day and having to reapply multiple times, having something that isn't greasy is important to me. This formula is greasy and stays greasy throughout the day. This pack is also quite expensive compared to other similar quality items.

I love, love, love this stuff! I recently got a new tattoo and wanted to protect it. But so many other high SPF sunscreens also leaves a white cloudy film over the piece. This stuff is amazing. I just spray it on and rub it in. No smell, no white residue. I ordered a bunch more.

I hate myself for buying this product. I couldn't sleep from the itching and my skin broke all over the places where I had used this product. I don't even have sensitive skin. I wish someone had told me about such horrifying side effects. I now have officially ruined my vacation plan due to the irritation, swelling, redness, rash, itching, etc. I need to see a dermatologist for this horrible product.

This brand is a Lifesaver! I was worried about the packaging the product was being shipped in. It is truly ultra sheer with full coverage and worth the price. I have extra sensitive skin. I never itch or get sun burn in the smallest areas. ðŸ˜€

Like any sun protection when you're located in a high UV area reapply regularly. This product works and feels great on the skin. Not a strong odor so it doesn't give you a headache.

I had a spray can of this last year, kept in my golf bag, and it was excellent. It went on dry, really protected well, and has none of the oily, greasy feel of most sunscreens. Then, I read there was a recall as it had some possible contamination with a carcinogen. Well, it worked, went on dry and sheer, so I continued to use it until it was empty, then bought another with the new formulation. Now, it is oily and seems to inhibit sweat which, on a Florida golf course in hot weather, can promote heat exhaustion, something I never experienced with the old, possibly carcinogenic, formula. On the plus side, it does the job of protecting you from the sun, but it is no longer the dry-apply superior product it once was. If you're prone to suffering from heat, I suggest you find something else and I'm currently searching for something myself. Was once a 5 star product, now 3 stars at most, IMNSHO.

I had this on. I wasnâ€™t out even an hour and have severe sunburn on both arms. Do not buy this product.
