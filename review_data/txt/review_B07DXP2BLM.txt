I've been using this product since last summer. One 14g sunstick will last about a month. It's a little bit more expensive than some products available, but it's so comfortable and convenient and it's worth the money. It has some sort of herb smell and I like it.

I've used many different sunblocks and sunsticks, and this one is really nice in that it doesn't feel sticky; it just feels like lotion. Plus, it is really compact; it won't take up much space in your bag.

A conveniently small Sun stick that’s non greasy and leaves no white cast. The formula contains a mattifying powder that can pil if there are too many serums/ products already on your face.

It’s very small. Like literally scam

Pro: It’s definitely matte when applying to skin! Exactly what I was looking for  Cons: Expensive for the amount of product you get and mine came in an Asian packaging and I’m a little weary of counterfeit beauty products from Asia so we’ll see if my skin doesn’t breakout.  Sell should show the packaging.
