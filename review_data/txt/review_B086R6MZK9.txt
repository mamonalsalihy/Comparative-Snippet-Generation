Love sunbum. The spray is really easy. Always keep a bottle in the boat

Like this a lot but will stick to my coppertone smell,

After the first use, the entire bottle of sunscreen leaked into my beach bag, literally leaving a puddle of sunscreen liquid. Sadly, I can't get a refund because it's past the window of return. Who uses two bottles of sunscreen in a month?

Its hard to find Sun Bum 15 in my area, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Love this spray. Smells good, and has great protection.

Awesome my favorite sunscreen

I love this product in all strengths, however I have gotten one bottle out of almost every two pack that would not spray

Great product.

One sprayed and the other never would spray. And there is a no return policy so I just have to take a loss for the non working sunscreen spray.

I ordered 2 cans of Sun Bum and packed one for our trip to Mexico. The sun is intense and my Sun Bum won’t spray. I’ve tried several things and at best I get a dribble. This is the second time I have experienced this with this product. I look forward to your response.

I only received one when I purchased a two pack!
