Really like this product. It is easy to apply, an effective shield against sunburn, and does not run into your eyes when you sweat. I have very sensitive skin that has had cancers and i use sunscreen daily regardless of weather conditions. This sunscreen applies like a stick deodorant and contains both zinc and titanium. However, it does not turn your skin white and does not run into your eyes when you sweat. I just recently discovered this product and have already a 6 pack so i donâ€™t run out.
