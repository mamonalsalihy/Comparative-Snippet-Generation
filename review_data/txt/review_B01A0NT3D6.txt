We live at the beach, so we use a lot of sunscreen products, but our "go-to" lotions are always La Roche-Posay Anthelios. We've been using them for years - before they were available in the States we used to order them from Canada and pay exorbitant shipping - that's how good they are! Anthelios is a proprietary formula developed by La Roche Pharmaceuticals that is vastly more effective than anything I've ever used. Early implementations of it were kind of thick and a little "zinc-like" in that they didn't blend in all the way, and they tended to give your skin a white-grey cast, so while they were effective, they weren't attractive to use. The newer formulations smooth on easily and penetrate deeply leaving no residue. This one is the best yet - it's a "dry" lotion, so it isn't at all greasy or oily, it blends in very quickly and leaves your skin with a nice matte finish. You could definitely finish this off with makeup and wear it all day in the sun without fear of UV damage.  PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.

I love La Roche Posay and have been using their sunscreens for several years- the anthelios 50 and 60 mineral sunscreens are great (although not matte enough). This sunscreen indeed has a nice matte texture, but it immediately becomes flaky when spread over the skin. I’ve been using this for almost a month and there’s no difference between applying after exfoliation. I will not re purchase and I will stick to their other great sunscreens.

I AM OBSESSED! I have fair, oily prone to acne skin. No matter what I do my face is a shiny mess by noon on a good day, not to even speak of a hot humid NYC summer day. My daily face routine is toner-moisturizer- SPF- tinted moisturizer,- setting spray with this SPF I don't even use my primer anymore! This product has a really nice, smooth, rich texture. I am pale so the white product blends into my skin very well, after application my skin looks and feels dry to the touch without making you feel like your skin is dehydrated. (As can happen with many mattifying products) Honestly most weekends days I end up going out with just this and no makeup, that's how good it looks. It is a little expensive but seriously it's so worth it!

I was really looking forward to this product and I’m very disappointed with it. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it does become flakey especially when used with other skin products - which is extremely inconvenient because If you’re like me you use other products as in your skincare routine, not just sunscreen on bare skin. Plus I’m dark skinned and this clashes with my skin tone, it takes a while to really rub it in and then it becomes flakey to make things worse. PLUS - and this was my biggest issue with this - I’m prone to acne and this made me breakout. I finally got my acne under control for months and once I added this sunscreen to my routine, I started breaking out within a week. I stay strict to my skin care routine and adding this was the only change to my routine. Be warned!

Finally found a daily sunscreen that does not make my skin more oily than it already is! This sunscreen is great - no white residue. Go to for daily use over the summer and sunny days throughout the rest of the year. Highly recommend. Also scores well on that EWG sunscreen rating with a 3 (1 is best, 10 is worst). I previously used EltaMD UV Clear sunscreen and really liked it, but then when I saw it had a EWG rating of 8, I thought I better find something better since I'm using this daily.

I’m a caramel complexioned African American woman with oily, acne prone skin. I’m very satisfied with this brand. I use this version during winter months because it does have a slightly greasy film. I use another version of this with the same brand for summer months, because it’s specifically made for people with oily skin. Like most people, my skin is less oily and sweaty during winter months. Pro: it keeps my skin from hyper-pigmentating on the cheeks and mouth area. It doesn’t cause breakouts. Cons: it does leave a slight ashy/white film but that tends to fade away or maybe I’m less aware of it as the day goes on. Overall I’d recommend this product but not for anyone of darker skin than mine because I think the ashy film will be more noticeable. Well that is if you don’t follow up with a foundation to cover it up.

It start to ball up and pill after it dried. If you swipe your face lightly the product will start to fall off. I have toner and moisturizer on my face and nothing on my neck before applying this sunscreen but this happened on both of my face and neck. Not sure how this will affect the result but it definitely feels bad. It’s not returnable so I’ll just use it as body sunscreen in the future..

I am a fair skinned, red head that has battled a significant case of rosacea for nearly 40 years. All sunscreens caused breakouts after a few days of use. I tried high end sunscreens from the dermatologist, over the counter generic and everything in between. The only one that I could use regularly on my face was Lubriderm hand lotion with SPF 15. The feel and finish was not ideal and the low spf didn't give me the protection I need. I have been using La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Sunscreen SPF 60 for more than a month with success. No breakouts. Hallelujah! I love, love, love the matte finish. An oily face is a complete thing of the past. An added bonus for rosacea sufferers if an ever so slight reduction of the red blotches. I put it on a bit thicker on my nose, chin and cheeks (where my red blotches are most pronounced). I do check for white patches after a bit and just rub in any I find. I don't use makeup because of the breakout factor but I do have a wonderful moisturizer that works for me. Once the sunscreen is absorbed I apply my moisturizer and I'm left with the most evenly colored skin I've had in years - with no additional breakouts. Does this sunscreen make my rosacea invisible? No, of course not. But I feel much prettier than I've felt in years so that's a win for me!

The first time I put this sunscreen on, I was disappointed. I put it on after my moisturizer dried. It flaked and rubbed off, looked white and patchy, almost like I powdered my face.  I was in a rush, so I needed a quick fix and put small spots of moisturizer on my face again to spread the powder out. It kind of worked.  Today, I think I figured out the problem! The first few times I put it on, I squeezed all of the sunscreen I needed on my finger, then put little "spots": Three on my forehead, one on each cheek, chin, and nose. Then I spread it out. This caused the dry powder build-up. I think since the sunscreen is "dry-touch" it dries up quickly and clumps up. Tip: Don't rub your skin right after the sunscreen sets (or else it'll flake off)  So INSTEAD, I DID NOT let my moisturizer dry. I let it set, but while it was still "wet", I squeezed out SMALL bits of sunscreen and, focused on one part of my face at a time. This worked!!  Right now, (after like 10 minutes) my skin is "normal" to the touch. Not powdery nor oily, and it doesn't feel heavy at all! I've tried so many other sunscreens and they're just heavy, powdery, and/or oily... I'm going to stick with this one, and my acne-prone eczema skin is loving it

I bought this on recommendation of a Youtuber I watch with similar skin (dry skin). I got the smaller size to try it out before committing to the bigger bottle. It's a little smaller than I anticipated, but it'll be perfect for travel.  The packaging is a matte finish, but despite having texture issues with matte packaging, it's not too bothersome (frosted matte bottles are the worst). I apply this after I moisturize so I just leave some moisturizer on my hands before picking this sunscreen up and I have no issues. It's a squeeze bottle, so it takes a little getting used to to find the right amount to squeeze out. For me, I use a black bean sized amount for my face, ears, and a little on the neck.  The product itself is white, thick, and mildly scented. The scent reminds me of the Cetaphil Sensitive Skin Cleanser. It's not potent, but it is noticeable during application. I just applied a bit to the back of my hand and I had to put my nose right up to my hand to smell it. Others have noticed a white cast from the sunscreen. I haven't noticed that personally as I'm pale (I wear 110 in the Maybelleine Superstay Foundation).  It smooths out nicely over the skin and dries to a matte finish quite quickly. After I apply this, I wet my Beauty Blender and immediately apply my foundation in the morning. I love that I don't have to worry about letting it sink in and dry on my skin. This is moisturizing enough that if I am running behind, I can apply just this and still feel like my skin isn't a dried up prune.  Something I have noticed is that it feels slightly cooling. It's not dramatic by any means, but it is noticeable. It doesn't last long either, but if cooling is a no-no for you, then stay away.  It really does work well. Since using this for the last month or so, I noticed my face getting paler and paler than the rest of my body. I applied a summer foundation color and on my face, it looked comical.  Overall, this sunscreen does exactly what it needs to. A little goes a long ways, so the price is worth it in my opinion. I love the matte finish it gives, as it's my preferred finish, but it still overs some moisture to my dry skin. I'll be buying the bigger bottle soon so I can have this size for travel.

My skin has always loved La Roche-Posay so I thought I would give this a try. I've used another sunscreen from La Roche-Posay but stopped using it because it was oily. With this product though, I haven't had any issues so far. I have oily skin and my skin has been breaking out lately, so this sunscreen has helped with that. The only issue is the residue it leaves when the product dries on my skin. I don't see the white residue when I blend it into my skin, but once it dries up, there are patches where the residue is visible. It doesn't bother me too much because I put makeup over this, but if you're looking to use this alone, I suggest checking your face after it dries.

I have very sensitive acne prone skin and all the products that claim to be for sensitive skin, non oily, & non comedogenic have fallen short on a least one of the promises…BUT THIS ONE’S A WINNER! I can reapply throughout the day & it’s like there’s nothing there! NO clogged pores at the end of the day even if I sweat with it on! Sensitive enough to swipe across my eyelids and swim in my pool with ZERO IRRITATION! 😍

La Roche-Posay no es cualquier marca, así que para que sea de esta marca me pareció súper económico. Yo tengo la piel muy pero muy grasosa, y este producto es perfecto para mi piel, lo puedo esparcir fácilmente, no se hace grumos, y el tono blancuzco que queda inicialmente, desaparece al minuto, no me da comezón, siento mi cara fresca por varias horas, lo que me ha echo pecar de olvidar de ponérmelo de nuevo pasando las dos horas, realmente a mi piel le ha caído súper. Lo recomiendo al 100% me encanto y eso que ya había probado antes no recuerdo cuantos protectores solares para mi cara, de todo precio, color y marca, pero yo me quedo con este definitivamente.

First time buying thru Amazon. Product review: I love this sunscreen. I have acne prone, combination sensitive skin. This does not leave a white cast (a little in the eyebrows so that needs to be rubbed in to remove the white). It leaves my face less oily, but doesn't dry it out either. Shipping : Product was not damaged at all. Box was open at the top/bottom but that didn't cause any issues.  Picture with tweezers just for size reference since it was the closest thing I had to me.

eos-eos

Probably the best sun screen I've ever used. Got a sample from my derm doc and loved it. Found the best price on Amazon. Love the way it absorbs with zero white residue. No sticky or tacky feel. I use it alone at times and under make-up at other times. I have sensitive skin and have not had any problem with break-outs. Absorbs right in and looks and feels invisible on my skin.

I have hyper pigmented skin but I got laser treatment to erase that and wanted to get a good sunscreen that would help keep it away. I have very sensitive and naturally oily skin that breaks out easily. I also live in Florida so I am always in the sun and surrounded by humidity. I have tried so many products over the years and this sunscreen is the best I have ever had!!! NO breakouts. I do always wear a hat though if I'm going out to the beach, but the parts of my face that the sun does hits, doesn't burn. Also the pigmentation hasn't come back so I'm very happy with that too! I recommend this product to all of my friends! Obsessed!!!

For reference: I'm blonde, blue eyed, pale, and mostly of British/Irish/Scandinavian ancestry. I have sensitive, slightly oily skin and still get an occasional pimple or two with stress, hormones, or new skin products. This is one of the few sunscreens I will put on my face! I wear it almost every single day. It wears beautifully under a full face of makeup. Doesn't irritate, actually helps control oil, has never made me break out, and feels weightless. To help offset the cost, I use Blue Lizard or similar on the rest of my body and only use this on my face. It's incredible sunscreen and I highly recommend!

This is expensive but I only use it on my face. I had melanoma cancer years ago and it was removed successfully no problems for 13 years. Recently diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma metastatic in all my internal organs and my dermatologist recommended using this as after treatments my skin is extremely sensitive He advised that well it’s expensive it is the only item on the market that actually blocks 90% of the harmful effects of the sun..

This is the best sunblock for my face that I have ever found! It absolutely is "dry touch"! It goes on easily--I dot it around my face and neck and then smooth it on. In less than a minute, it feels like powder. I barely notice I put anything on my skin. I don't wear make-up everyday, so I really needed something to protect my face from the sun's aging effects. But I also have the oily T-zone of a teen and can't stand the greasy feeling of most sunblocks after half a day of wear. This sunblock, however, still feels like nothing after a whole day. I don't even notice it's there. Definitely will buy again!

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen. First truly non-sticky, non-greasy sunscreen without heavy silicones mixed in. There is no scent. It seems moisturizing and then dries down to a matte but slightly dewy feel and finish. Does not break me out or cause any trouble to my combination, hyper sensitive skin.

eos-eos

I love love love this product. I've always wanted to find an spf that will not make my skin oily and I finally found it. I also like that I don't have to use a lot of product just a pea size is enough for my whole face. I will continue to use it and I would recommend it to those that have acne or oily skin

eos-eos

This is what my dermatologist recommended for me to wear every day. I have sensitive skin and have struggled in the past to find a daily moisturizer that doesn’t burn my skin or at some point get in my eyes during the day and burn them. This does neither. Happy with the product and will continue to buy it.

I've been using LRP products for a long time now, but the formula of this sunscreen is amazing. I live in a really humid tropical place and it runs smoothly, doesn't pill, doesn't feel greasy and it absorbs quickly so no white cast. Gives you a mate finish. I bought one for me (acne prone skin) and one for my mom (mature/normal to dry skin) and she likes it as well. She applies it after her moisturiser and says it feels good on her.

The previous product from La Roche-Posay was oily and stayed oily for a bit after application. This one is not oily at all. It has a slight white color upon application which helps show where it has not been applied. The white disappears quickly. I have used their sun screens for many years because I cannot use Titanium Dioxine as I am allergic to it.

I bought this product, because it had great write ups. It is nice,,,pleasant scent. But every time I used it, the product would pill on my skin. I used it over my serum and that could have been a problem. I do use it straight on my skin and have no problems. I gave it a good rating because it does work nicely directly on skin.

I am often “life guarding” for my grandkids by the pool. This sunscreen is perfect. It spreads perfectly and provides all the coverage I need.

I have acne prone oily skin and this is the best Sunscreen I’ve used. I use and anti wrinkle cream before I apply a pea-sized amount of this product. Once it’s applied, it dries fast and doesn’t leave behind a shiny/oily layer like other sunscreens. I also have not had any breakouts in the few weeks I’ve been using this product.

Nothing short of miraculous! I have the La Roche SPF 60 Melt-in Sunscreen, but it always feels thick and greasy. This stuff, however, stays matte. I wear it daily over vitamin C serum and under foundation. I live in a part of California where it gets up over 100 in the summer. This stuff stands the test under makeup in high heat. You will NOT be disappointed!

Do you want coverage without feeling like you have 1/4 inch of goo on your skin? Want something that protects without a gawds awful stink to it? How about a sunscreen that doesn't have anything bad for you in it? This is the one. Don't even try anything else. Consumer Reports agrees. This is the SH*T!

This goes on clear and smooth. It's not oily and it doesn't smell like sunscreen. I love it!

I LOVE this sunscreen. It actually makes me want to put sunscreen on everyday. It absorbs so fast and doesn't make you all shiny. I have really sensitive acne prone skin and this sunscreen works great for me. I cannot recommend it enough.

Was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I have combination oily and dry skin but always have struggled with acne so finding a suncreen that doesn't make my skin oily and breakout is hard. But this one is great! It goes on like a medium thickness lotion, dries with a matte finish and although I struggle still with acne this lotion doesn't not make it worse. Makes a great primer for make-up and protects your skin!

I use this sunscreen mixed with my cc cream on top of my skin routine everyday. It does not clump or pill, it is very easy to spread and gives me the sun screen coverage I need

My go-to sunblock. Has a nice matte finish that looks great alone, but it does have a white cast that may be unflattering on some skin tones. It evens out the look of my skin. Most facial sunblocks make me itchy and red, this is forgiving and works well under or over most of my foundations. I do have some pilling with a heavier (silicon) moisturizer. It also has never burned my sensitive eyes.

I get itchy eyes with most sunscreens. This one is great.

I am very fair and have sensitive skin. This is a bit thick, but it does the trick. I would recommend trying the tinted if you are wearing makeup. The lotion is white and even with foundation over you can look pale.

Absolutely great product and fast shipping it's arrived before estimated delivery time and the sunscreen absorbed perfectly on the skin dry touch I definitely love it...

I loved it because it's literally what I needed. My skin tends to be oily and some sunscreens worsen that, sometimes they cause me pimples and I hated that but with this one my skin gets softer and more dry, just what I needed and no oclussion of my pores again!! I love it! I wish they had a bigger presentation for this one.
