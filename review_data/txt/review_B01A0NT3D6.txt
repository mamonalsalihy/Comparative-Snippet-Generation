El peor protector, te deja la cara blanca, se siente bien pesado a la hora de aplicar y se levanta

Sunscreen feels pretty light and offers very good protection

I used to love this sunscreen cause it protects well from the sun, it’s easy to spread and the texture feels good on the skin. But since I started to use it daily on my face, I had a breakout of pimples and I wasn’t understanding where they were coming from. I hardly have pimples. So after a test, I realized it was because of the sunscreen! I feel sad cause I liked the sunscreen, but my self-esteem is shaken now with so much acne! It says it’s oil-free, suitable for all skins and doesn’t cause breakouts, well, for me it didn’t work. I saw that for most people it seems to work, but I don’t know if people use it daily like I did. I just think it may not be suitable for all kinds of skin. Be aware!

When it dries it leave white spots. When you try to spread the dry spots it gets flaky therefore removing anything else added before or after.

This goes on clear and smooth. It's not oily and it doesn't smell like sunscreen. I love it!

I bought this a month ago, went to go use it this weekend and it’s completely rotten. It’s all separated, half straight up oil and half chunky white goo. I shook it very well and it won’t mix. Seem as if it’s old, but it’s not expired. I’m pretty angry about it since the return window just closed. Do not buy this!
