This is a beautiful sunscreen product, however, they are so cheap in regards to how much they give to you. When a company is generous with the product it says something & it goes a very long way! People will be turned off by the SIZE OF THIS TUBE. Sorry, I am simply being honest!

Just an amazing product! The glow is very nice, just make sure you warm the product up in your hand and blend it into your skin. If your skin is too dry it will look streaky. This is like traveling with your own lighting kit, perfect if you’re the brown girl… The product comes in a teeny little bottle but has lasted me for about a month so far and I still have some left!!! If you don’t like this product somethings wrong with you PERIOD

This SPF was absolutely beautiful when I first put it on. I have really dry skin, so I was excited for the stunning glow it gave me. However, after a couple hours, my face started to burn. Eventually, I had to wash the SPF off my face because it was so irritating. I tried this product TWO other times to make sure it was the reason for my bad skin reaction, and it was. It made my face burn and break out in tiny bumps every time. I wanted to love this product so much, but my face hated it :(

Hey, medium to darker skinned Black woman who thinks she’s about to get a cute lil shimmer, I’m talking to you. DO. NOT. BUY. I thought it was going to be a bronze-y, body shimmer in clear sunscreen type of product. WRONG. It’s definitely some sort of pigment for fair-skinned people. I’m so upset I just wasted my money. Mchk. Lemme see if I can return it...

eos-eos

I definitely see the hype about this product but I do not like that it leaves you this shimmery look especially on the forehead so if you’re in your 40s you will see like shimmery lines meaning your wrinkles will shimmer

I love this stuff! It was recommended to me in a Facebook group when I asked for a one-and-done face cream for someone who doesn't really wear makeup. I wanted dewy, I wanted some light refraction, I wanted sun protection, and I didn't want heavy color. This is all those things. It works really well in the Florida sun. I'm covered in freckles and it doesn't dull or smudge them (freckle faces, you know what I mean) it just brightens everything. I don't wear face makeup, other than the occasional swipe of bronzer, and this works great with that. Love it love it love it.

Not super impressed with product for price! While it's a great water-resistant tinted moisturizer, I found it to be a tiny bit shiny; not leaving sparkles on your hands, just personally I think Ulta's Brand tinted moisturizer with SPF to have more natural & better coverage while it's more moisturizing. This is coming from someone who 90% of the time buys MATTE, oil-free, non-comogenic products. Just my opinion.

eos-eos

I think this sunscreen is best if you wear makeup often, or you are looking for a tint with high SPF protection. Personally, I like sunscreens with a glowy finish and high protection so this was nice.  It rubs off on my mask but it is not an issue if you wash your mask often :) I would recommend the UNSEEN sunscreen or the glow stick sunscreen if you don't like a tint in your sunscreen!

eos-eos

This stuff is not our momma’s sunscreen!! This is a gooey, non sticky, doesn’t burn, Doesn’t stink sunscreen!! I love how it makes my skin look like it’s dewy but not fake tan. Love this stuff.

eos-eos

I absolutely love the glow it gave me. I have freckles and it covered that up nicely. I didn’t need to wear makeup with this sunblock. It does rub off on your clothes so be mindful (like any makeup) to put it on away from your Neckline or colar.

I just spent 3+ hours in direct sun today, which would normally fry my skin completely or at least give me a massive pile of new very dark freckles. Also spent another 3 hours out in less intense sun today. My poor knees are *fried* and hot pink (really hurts, not fun) -- but I put a thin layer of this on my face, neck, chest, hands, and forearms and it looks like nothing happened at all. I'm sold on this as a sunscreen - it's effective, lightweight, easy to apply, and you barely need any to get full coverage. (No more super sticky, or super pasty white, impossible to wash off sunscreens - I love this stuff.)  I wasn't sure the tint and "glow" would work for me. I don't normally wear much makeup beyond eyeliner and sometimes lipstick - don't like to look too "made up." My daughter tried this first, and on her slightly olive skin (more yellow/green undertones) it didn't look good. She came out looking kind of orange and way too shiny. (Now I realize she probably put on waaaay too much.) I tried it a few days later, and somehow on my skin (very pale, pinkish/blue undertones) it looks great - like I'm not wearing makeup at all. Maybe it works because I have freckles, and this tint (slightly pale "cafe con leche" kind of brown) goes with the freckles? Whatever - I love it.  I like that this doesn't make me look overly made up. If I use it sparingly it doesn't look like I put on anything at all, maybe a little sunnier than usual. If I put on too much it looks shiny and feels too thick (makes my skin sweat), but if that happens I just wipe a little off before it sets.  It's ridiculously expensive (I had used rewards points to buy it so didn't realize it's normally $36 for the bigger tube). But honestly, it works. Keeping my skin from getting too much sun and doing it in a way that suits the low-makeup look I like, this is totally worth it. I've had this tube 6 weeks and barely made a dent in it - really don't need more than maybe the amount of a dime (about 3" long stripe of the tiny amount it dispenses at once) to do face and neck.  I'll definitely buy this again. Good stuff. I found it via a make up artist's blog, Violette_FR. (I tried her two moisturizers at the same time, which I also love.)

I'm a big supergoop fan. I use a few of their items. I like this one. It has spf protection which is a must for me and just gives me a slight glow that helps my face seem a little brighter. It's not magic so don't expect it to do all the things, but if you're just looking for a little pick me up look and a little glow it's great. I don't like foundation. I hate the way it or heavy makeup feel on my face. I use this and when I feel like doing it up, a bit of concealer under my eyes a cheek stain and a eyeliner/shadow. It doesn't have the coverage that a foundation would have, but I don't want that anyway

Maybe I don’t understand dimensions, but this bottle is smaller than the size of my hand... like not as big as the palm of my hand

There's a TON of hype around this product and I let myself get caught up in it and ran off the $36 cliff along with everyone else. This product bills itself as a sort of hybrid between sunscreen and makeup primer. It definitely has a beautiful finish, no white cast, and feels soft to the touch - I'm sure makeup would wear very nicely over it. Unfortunately, despite the hype, this product falls into the same two traps as the two product types it tries to marry. As a tinted sunscreen, the color will be unwearable for many. My skin is fair to light and this tint is very obvious on my face and slightly mustard-like. I don't know how this would work for folks with skin that's deeper than medium, but I can confirm that this does not work on fair skin. And as a makeup primer? I'm sure it's nice, but you'd have to use so much of it in order to get the SPF 40 that any cosmetic advantage you'd get from a primer gets lost in a soup of sunscreen. I applied about a quarter of what I'd need to get the total SPF and it looks and feels heavy and itchy, because no makeup primer is meant to be used in such large amounts. Also, the more I apply, the more noticeable and artificial the tint becomes.  Like I said, I let myself get caught up in the hype and purchased a product that I ultimately can't really use. I'll try to figure out a way to make it work because it was so, so expensive, but it's going to need A LOT of support products to come close to a reasonable SPF without making me look like I've tried to simulate a tan by applying the wrong shade of foundation.  If you're looking at buying this because you think it will be different from all those other tinted SPF products, don't, because it really is just like all the others.

I love this brand. I decided to try this particular variety because it was described as luminous. And it is! It may be way too shiny for many people, and certainly if you prefer a mat finish this is not for you. I apply this after my moisturizer allow it to dry and then use my elta MD as the second layer of protection. My skin stays moist all day, even when I'm outside. I really like that weightlessness, it goes on quite sheer. I'm not sure that I will reorder because it is so very shiny.

eos-eos

The media could not be loaded. Well I guess they sent me a sample of it!!!because the bottle it’s a little literally it looks like a sample!! What a joke! Dont bother!

I ordered this after buying several products by this brand for my daughters. They love all of them (spray sunscreen, face sunscreen, facial glow). So I decided to try this for myself, since I really need a good sunscreen in Texas and I love the tinted glow it gives my daughters.  I’m happy with the product and can see myself using it daily in place of makeup. But I didn’t realize this container would be tiny. It doesn’t have enough to last more than a month with daily use, if that. I would check prices to ensure Amazon has the lowest. I bought the other products from local stores.

eos-eos

Purchased this for my mom, she loves that this is a sunscreen for every day and it actually does something. Makeup is smoother, a decent amont of highlight or glow and feels moisturizing. She has normal to oily skin and is in her 60’s and loves that this isn’t too heavy.

eos-eos

I have only used this product twice so far, but I was blown away at the glowy shine on my usually dry face! Totally illuminating, definitely not in a shiny, greasy way. I tend to have sensitive skin…can’t use too much of anything besides a moisturizer and the occasional tinted moisturizer (don’t own foundation because I use that little product). I haven’t had any issues with breakouts at all…fingers crossed. I’ve used the unseen sunscreen regularly now for over two years and love that product. This is wonderful with the UV coverage and tint that blends in so lightly and smoothly into your skin…just love it! Highly recommended. Just wish there was a subscribe and save option…

Buy it now. So beautiful and I even glow with my mineral powder makeup over it. It spreads so silky smooth and blends in nice. Don’t buy this if you either have a lot of texture to your skin or don’t want to accentuate skin texture. Shiny products always accentuate texture. I don’t mind my skin texture, and I have not been phased by this perfectly smooth skin goals trend. Skin is supposed to have pores and a few wrinkles ☺️

eos-eos

I’ve tried a lot of sunscreen and primers over the last year. I mean A LOT. My skin is super sensitive, acne prone, and prone to dry and redness. (Complicated I know) This stuff doesn’t feel heavy, moisturizes really well while not feeling like I’ll break out later. It protected my skin from sunburn during 6 hours at six flags. I don’t wear a ton of makeup but the foundation and bronzer I wore didn’t budge or crease. It makes your skin glow like crazy which alone is a bit much for me but under some foundation it looks amazing! Def worth the buy and will buy again.

eos-eos

One of my customers was wearing this and her skin looked amazing! She told me it was this product, so I ordered some for myself. It's sheer, super glowy, and gives me just the right amount of sheen for a dewy look. I keep getting compliments from people that I look good, but they don't say "what's on your face?". It just gives you a gorgeous movie star look to the skin. I'm obsessed and don't know how I lived without this product!! I wear it over a small amount of CC cream from another brand, and sometimes just the SuperGoop alone. Very pleased with this stuff.

eos-eos

My friends skin was glowing and looked amazing and I asked her what she was using. She told me it was her sunscreen. I purchased it the same day. I purchased another as soon as I started using it so that I would have more when I ran out. It’s been well over 2 months and I haven’t ran out yet. Not even close and I wear it every day. The tint looks amazing and it feels moisturizing. My skin glows. I wear it day and night. I use it instead of foundation. Amazing stuff!

eos-eos

Just love that I can wear this out of the house and it gives my face a more even skin tone. If I want my skin to look really great I can put it on with my IT Cosmetics foundation and there is no caking or wierd lines. I am in my mid fifties and it does not settle in my wrinkles with or without foundation.

eos-eos

Listen, I don’t love Goop and all it stands for.. but this product is in a league of its own. There’s a reason it’s a cult favorite. It’s perfect on its own with a really nice glow, but acts as a primer (and a good one at that) if you’re doing a full face. It’s pricey, but worth it.

eos-eos

About 20 min after applying this, my natural oils mixed with the product and my skin look glow galore! Tawny and just the tiniest bit of tanner. Hours later, including standing in unobstructed afternoon sun for 35 min, my face is not greasy nor does it have that tell tale warmth that comes with time in the sun or a deficient sunblock. I have a feeling this is going to be one of my new favorite products, definitely a must have.

eos-eos

I like how moisturizing it is; does work well as a primer before foundation; some may not like the shine it has even with foundation on top but I like it; wanted to wear it without foundation but too much of a yellowish tint which drained my skin tone. Not sure I will buy again only due to the cost - too expensive for the quantity.

eos-eos

I don’t like celebrity brands as a general rule but this glow sunscreen leaves a luminous finish without feeling too heavy. I’m 50 and my menopausal skin is combo but tending toward more dry these days and this stuff helps my makeup glide on better w less flaky skin. This is very expensive and nite the ounces, but it’s also fab!

eos-eos

This has become my daily face sunscreen. I have tried so MANY sunscreens. I goes on CLEAR-no white chalky look. It has not caused issues with breakout or dryness for my sensitive skin. It looks and feels like my own skin just protected from the sun. Due to the small container size and price I only use it for my face and neck.

eos-eos

I love that this came in a smaller size so I could test it out before making a large purchase. It’s ok overall. It’s light on the face and does not have a strong smell and there is no white cast. I’m on the fence about it’s glowiness. I’m going to also try out the non-glow version and go with the one I like most.

eos-eos

Dr. Shereene Idriss, an influencer on YouTube, convinced me to try this product. It does exactly what she said--it is a sunscreen that has a glowing tint to it. It is very smooth, goes on very easily, and gives your skin just a little lift with the glow. It works all by itself, most of the time I do not add a concealer or foundation. This is now my go-to product.

eos-eos

I’m very pleased w/this tinted moisturizer w/40 SPF. Be careful applying as it can leave skin a bit too glistening. I’ve learned to apply judiciously and sometimes I mix w/my liquid foundation to down play the sheen. I like that this moisturizer’s SPF does not burn my eyes if accidentally exposed to it. That’s really important when trying to apply eye makeup after moisturizing:)

eos-eos

I use this as my daily sunscreen after using a moisturizer. It glides on so smoothly, and gives you a hint of sheer color as well. It doesn't burn my eyes either, which is saying something as most makeups and sunscreens eventually sting my eyes. It also doesn't clog pores, as it's non-comodogenic and important for my acne prone skin. I love this stuff!

eos-eos

I love that this sunscreen gives the face an even toned glow. It looks natural after it is applied and it absorbs easily. It doesn't make your face look like you're wearing makeup, foundation, etc. The only thing that I don't like is that it makes my face shiny. I already have an oily forehead. Nevertheless, I would still buy this sunscreen again.

eos-eos

This lightweight sunscreen is worth every cent. I put it on under my moisturizer and a slight glow shines through. It spreads quickly and evenly. It also protects well from the sun, as it should. Will buy again and again and again.

eos-eos

This is a great product. The slight tint allows me to eliminate a base makeup for everyday wear. It provides an even glow to the skin with a dewey look.

eos-eos

This is my favorite sunscreen. While it seems expensive you don’t need a lot of product as it is really spreadable, so the tube lasts a long time. I love that I can skip moisturizer, as this product is moisturizing enough. The “shimmer” adds a nice glow for those days you don’t want to add foundation or adds an extra glow under your foundation.

eos-eos

Love this product for when I don’t want to wear foundation but still need some spf and it makes you look dewy. Only problem is if you rub it in too much it pills up but other than that i love it.

This is a great product. Lightweight, good protection from the Sun, leaves an all over glow with light reflecting pigments. Was perfect to use at the pool. Didn’t need anything else on my face.

eos-eos

It has great coverage with out a noticeable color on your face except a great dewy glow. I do not use any makeup over this except a dot of concealer on a blemish if necessary. My skin is very oily and it actually controlled a lot of my natural shine which was a pleasant surprise. My biggest worry was the efficiency of the SPF but I spent 2 hours in the direct sun today at my nephews baseball game and the sun protection was incredible. It’s not an SPF I would wear to the beach where I would be in the sun and water for an extended period of time, but for normal daily activities it is exactly what I was looking for!

I personally LOVE this sunscreen. I am all about whatever gives you the best glow. Sunscreen is the best anti-aging product that you can use. For anyone who didn’t like this sunscreen, try their unseen sunscreen!

I love this product. I wear it daily it gives me a little color but not too much and it’s not greasy. This is the only product that doesn’t make my skin break out. I love it and will always buy it.

The texture is wonderful and easily slides on and absorbs into the skin. The only problem is that it makes my forehead appear to be oily all day. I love all dewy types of products, and I usually wear a tinted moisturizer. But this gives me the wrong type of glow.

eos-eos

This is my favorite everyday moisturizer! I throw it on every morning to protect my skin and get my glow started! Seriously, I have recommended this product so many times! Lightweight and makes your skin look effortlessly dewy! Sometimes I don't even use foundation for a night out, just this!

eos-eos

I didn’t expect to love this product so much. My skin loves it. It feels so good on, and gives me a dewy glowy look by itself, and does a great job as a primer with my foundation.

eos-eos

I find myself using significantly less makeup on days I wear this. Makes my skin super dewy and glowy. A product that os skincare, basically makeup, and sun protection is a win. The ingredients have made this product a staple in my makeup bag

eos-eos

Loved using this over the summer. Definitely has a good allover shimmery glowy finish. My boss paid me the ultimate compliment today and thought I was wearing makeup. Nope, just this awesome glowscreen. The product's only fault is the price point to floz. I'd like a little more bang for my buck. Amazing product and would still purchase again.

eos-eos

I am picky about ingredients but I already trust Supergoop and this stuff is awesome. I am not big on foundation, especially in the summer, and I love the way this sunscreen evens out my skin tone and makes me want to apply protection before makeup each morning!

I love the way this product makes my skin glow, nice light weight coverage with sun protection too. I use it alone but one could use it as a base too.

It’s a bit pricey but I rarely wear make up. Only use this 2,3 times a week and love how light it is. And has good coverage. I’ve had it for 3 months now and still has plenty.
