Do not use this sunscreen. I struggle with acne and this made it even worse. started to get better the minute i stopped using this

This is truly my holy grail of sunscreens. It is one of the only facial sunscreens that does not sting my sensitive skin. I have acne, and am on topical retinoid, as well as use of salicylic acid in the morning so I need good sun protection. This is lightweight, absorbs into the skin, and yet is very moisturizing. It doesn’t feel greasy or heavy, and it doesn’t make my skin feel like it can’t breathe. It layers great under makeup, and on top of my skin care. I would 1000% recommend this to anyone. The tinted one is also nice.

Finally a high quality sunscreen that is not thick and greasy! I'm in Hawaii and really needed a potent sunscreen but without the heavy feel to it that actually works. It is easy to spread and absorbs nicely. My dermatologist recommended this one and it's the winner!

Got this on my dermatologist's recommendation for mineral SPF protection - I've been undergoing monthly laser hair removal treatments on my face, and using a prescription retinoid at night for hyperpigmentation/scarring along my jawline. Elta SPF has so far been wonderful on my now improving skin texture and tone (granted, the retinoid and avoiding sun exposure probably also have helped). Easy to apply, no mineral cast not greasy, not aggravating to my skin.  My only gripe is the price! I have had to hunt for a less expensive mineral SPF to alternate with, but so far none are as good as Elta.

Best screen I have ever used! I am a fair skinned red head, sensitive to salicylates. This sunscreen goes on great, no white parlor, no greasy feeling! I was out all day in full sun , sweating and only 1 application i had NO BURN. Wish I found it earlier!!!

I like the spreadability of this sunscreen. It is not drying like some others. It is in scented but the odor is not unpleasant. I’m glad I purchased it.

Me encantó, mantiene la piel durante el día sin brillo, el control de grasa es impresionante, y además minimiza los poros aparte de proteger

I'll be a lifetime customer! This is the best facial sunscreen I've ever used, and I've tried them all as I spend long days during the summer in my kayak on the water. I apply this in the morning and it lasts all day, through sweat, rubbing, and water splashes! I burn very easily and usually use and reapply spf 100 a few times a day to avoid a burn. This product is life changing because I don't need to do that for my face anymore! It also feels light and isn't greasy light many sunscreens out there. If you're on the fence, it's absolutely worth every penny- but it now!

This has been a great find. Not greasy and my face does not break out.

Great product, light weight, feels light on my face and doesn't clog my pores. Love it!
