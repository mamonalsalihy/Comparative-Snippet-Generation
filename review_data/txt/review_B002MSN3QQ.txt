I’m very glad that I took a chance on the sunscreen! I was a bit skeptical due to the mixed reviews and there weren’t very many reviews that talked about whether there would be a white cast on dark skin. This product rubs on very smoothly and you can’t even feel that it’s there. My make up blends flawlessly with this underneath. This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever use on my face! It’s so thin and moisturizing. A little goes a long way so if you have a white cast you may have used too much. I have deep brown skin and there is no cast left.

La Roche Posay Anthelios has been my holy grail for years, but at some point, I wanted my sunscreen to have something else, so I switched to ELTA 46 SPF. Amazon is now an authorized retailer, so for those reviews saying there are counterfeit / fake products, it's not like that anymore! ELTA has some of the best ingredients in sunscreen you can imagine. Well, in any skincare product :) If you are looking for a good sunscreen, with extra benefits, go for this one. One of the best things is the coverage and protection. In Europe/Asia, most sunscreens have high rates both for UVA and UVB, but in the US, the main standard is SPF for UVB (rays causing burning, primarily), but not so much for UVA (UVA rays account for up to 95% of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's, and penetrates more deeply in the skin being more associated with aging process). Well, ELTA is one of those strange products (in the good sense) offering high protection for both, it does not leave a white cast, and it has ammaaaazing ingredients: Niacinamide comes high in the formulation (5%, as much as the overpriced NIA-24), and it's an all time star ingredient (antioxidant, brightens skin tone, treats hyperpigmentation, increases collagen, anti-inflammatory., etc), plus vitamin e, hyaluronic acid. Seriously, this lotion is game-changer, and very affordable for how good the formula is!

I discovered too late that this contains Octinoxate, an established endocrine disruptor, rated 5 by EWG. It's also harmful to corals and implicated in coral bleaching, and sunscreens containing octinoxate are now banned in Hawaii. Extremely disappointing to find it in a respected brand. Stick with zinc oxide: there are lots of great alternative bio and eco-friendly brands. From Campaign for Safe Cosmetics: "Octinoxate, also called Octyl methoxycinnamate or (OMC), is a UV filter. It can be absorbed rapidly through skin. Octinoxate has been detected in human urine, blood and breast milk, which indicates that humans are systemically exposed to this compound. Octinoxate is an endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can disrupt thyroid function."

This item doesn’t have a lot number or expiration date. My face has broken out ever since using this. I didn’t put two and two together until I got a new one from my dermotologist. See photo. The one that is from my dermotologist has a lot # and expiration date.

To all the people worried about getting a knock off product: I contacted EltaMD directly and Amazon IS an authorized reseller. I would just make sure you're actually buying it from Amazon, not another party and Amazon is just shipping it.  The product is pretty good, doesn't make my face greasy. Unfortunately it doesn't really have any moisturizing benefits so I have to use it with a moisturizer. Also has a faint scent, bot not as bad as other sunscreens.

I really like this SPF cream. First of all it doesn't smell 'perfumey' - it might have a hint of suntan lotion smell, but it's really faint. Second this cream is NOT GREASY and disappears fast - even though it has 9% zinc oxide. Third it has 46+ SPF with 7.5 Octinoxate to slow burning. I've finally had to admit that I need a strong SPF; given past brushes with melanoma and the sincere desire to not have the hide of an alligator. And while not inexpensive, this is far less than the cost of a lot of the better-quality moisturizers for men. You usually get exactly what you pay for and this is worth every penny. Finally, my better half tells me that this company doesn't test on animals. I believe that's a good thing. ;-)  WARNING: Many buyers have received fake products from other sellers. Buy only when sold and shipped by Amazon! The authentic product will have a flat sloping pump top that is shown in the attached photo. The fake products have a rounded top.  Pros: • Non greasy formula that easily absorbs into skin • Odorless and transparent • 9% Zinc Oxide provides long lasting protection • 7+% Octinoxate to reduce burning by dispersing UVB rays • Tested reliable 30+ SPF • UVA/UVB sun protection  Cons: • More expensive than drug-store brands

I bought this per my dermatologist’s recommendation to work as a sunscreen and moisturizer for my rosacea, and it made me break out horribly. I used it 1-2 times per day for a week or two and felt it might be making me break out, so stopped with the hope I could at least use it on vacation as a sunblock. When I did this, applying multiple times per day, I thought I had gotten sunburned, when in actuality my face was just red, swollen, and pimply from this lotion - it all subsided a day or two after I stopped using it. I switched to normal Coppertone and had no problems with burn or breakouts after that. I have never had a reaction to any product as severe as I did this one, which is odd considering it is supposedly designed for sensitive skin types, so beware!

eos-eos

I can't attest to the efficacy of the product, just posting to say, I had negative reactions to it. I have just crested the high side of mid-40s and really wanted to find a good daily sun protectant to guard against [further] aging. This was so well-reviewed, I chose it over the next closest contenders, Roche-Posay products (which I usually love).  Unfortunately, the first week of using it, I began to get tiny bumps on my face (not visible to the naked eye, but easily perceived with fingertips when washing or applying moisturizer). I had also been using a new 'flavor' of body lotion, so I went back to my basic tried-and-true products to let everything calm down for a bit, and try to definitively eliminate the culprit.  After two weeks, I again applied this on two successive days when I'd be out in the sun for an extended period. On Day 1, once I'd gotten outside and had started perspiring, my neck began burning, then itching maddeningly -- I was only outside in my yard gardening, so ran inside and I washed it thoroughly off my neck. My face seemed okay, so I left it there, and applied the product again to my ears and face (no neck) on Day 2 when heading out for a long weekend walk.  This time, again once I'd gotten outside and started perspiring, the product started burning and itching around my eyebrows and general eye area. I washed it off as best I could at the next public water fountain.  The next day, I began to show itchy, painful swollen patches on my face, ears, and throat (the latter pictured as best I could, but it was difficult to shoot an area I couldn't see!) This time, there had been no other 'new to me' product used, nor was there anything else that I carefully applied to ears/face/throat, all areas that then became rashy....  So alas, not a product I can use, and alas for the waste of a significant amount of money. >:/ I've used other physical sunscreens in the past (eg Badger) without any issues, so it must be some substance in the cream besides that causing the problem.

I LOVE this product for my rosacea prone skin. I recently tried to deviate to skinceutical spf, after using this for years, and broke out horribly. I ran to my closest derm to buy the EltaMD again.  I did buy this ONCE on Amazon (quite a while ago) and I got something that did not look like the product. It was the same texture, but kind of yellowish. That bottle, like one of the previous posters showed, did not have an expiration stamp. The bottles usually do have an expiration stamp on the bottom.  So, I still give it 5 stars for exceptional performance on sensitive skin and great sun protection, but recommend buying it in person, just to make sure you're getting the product you expect.  I decided to reach out recently to ask EltaMD about buying online (I was having difficulty locating it locally). Here's what EltaMD recently told me about Amazon being an authorized seller, dated 9/10/19.  "Thank you for contacting EltaMD.  All EltaMD products listed on amazon.com after 5/8/17 through a recent business agreement are authorized. Amazon now sells only authentic EltaMD products they purchase directly from us.

I've been using this product for two years and will not be without it for my morning routine. I carry one in my purse for driving (sun exposure) and reapply throughout the day if I leave the house or buildings. I'm nearly 60 y.o. and Asian. I used to have sun damaged age spots but since using this sunscreen, most faded and keeping my skin smooth. Be sure to reapply religiously every two hours and wear a wide brim hat. I also started to use it on the back of my hands to prevent more spots from forming. It's barely scented and pleasant. Easy to apply and not oily or sticky. It's easy to absorb and not chalky or leaving any unpleasant feel or reaction. My skin is not sensitive and has always been on a light to medium tone, depending on the seasons. I recommend it to women of my age. And by the way, drink a lot of water and wear a hat whenever possible. I also don't lay out in the sun to tan either. I think that helps.

I’ve never left a review before, but I have been using this sunscreen for over 6 years & I am very familiar with the qualities of this sunscreen. It is light, smooth and leaves a matte finish on your face. I did not think anything of my last order until I pumped it out and started using it…it was thick, tacky, globby, would not rub in and each day-has left my face a shiny mess. Wow!! Hugely different sunscreen. 😢. I was so frustrated and asked my dermatologist if he thought Elta had changed the formulation…and he didn’t think so. I decided to buy another bottle to see if it felt the same. I just received another bottle and pumped it out to feel the correct formulation. I used it today and the shine is gone and it was smooth and nice when I applied it. ****The bottle on the left with the notch at the top of the pump is the REAL Elta. The one on the right is the FAKE. Check your bottle pump. I saw another reviewer make this point and so I checked….and I found the exact same thing. I can’t return this fake bottle because it’s past the return window, but I am posting to help anyone else that needs clarification.

I use to love this product and have been using it religiously for the last 7 years. However recently I came across company based in Canada called The Sunscreen Company who claims to have sent the products out for third party testing and ELTA MD spf 46 performed poorly in UVA protection factor values. UVA rays are responsible for aging and wrinkles. Since I love the product and wanted to continue using it, I emailed ELTA MD for re-assurance but never got a response from them.  Personally, I am inclined to trust the 3rd party findings because micronized zinc (like that used in EltaMD) inherently does not offer strong UVA protection, especially when included in such a low concentration (which is only one factor of the entire formulation process that contributes to final protection values). I’d love for EltaMD to perform testing and refute the data here, because I do want to go back to using their elegant formulas, but until then, I don’t have faith they offer good uva protection.

I have been wearing sunscreen on my face everyday for about 7 years now. I've tried a lot different sunscreens and hated pretty much everything I tried. It either left a white cast, burned my skin and eyes, pilled up immediately, or was horrible under makeup. This sunscreen is not only good - but I actually enjoy wearing it!  I love almost everything about this sunscreen... my only complaint being it sometimes pills if I try to add anything on top of it. Other than that - the texture, the feel, the smell, I love. It is super rich and creamy to touch and feels very moisturizing when you apply to the face. It leaves a bit of shine but you can pat it out when it has dried. The container pumps the perfect amount each time - I use one pump for my face, neck, and ears.  I also have VERY acne prone skin and this has not broken me out. I has almost no acne causing ingredients - the exception being Zinc Oxide and Butylene Glycol which are both only 1 (out of 10) on the acne causing scale [source cosdna]. It has actually improved the quality / texture since adding it to my routine.  150% recommend

There's many reviews saying that this is a fake product but I emailed Elta MD and they said as of 2017, Amazon is an authorized retailer and If purchased through Amazon it should say "Ships from and sold by Amazon" or Amazon Services LLC.  Just be on the lookout for third party Amazon resellers where it might say for example "Sold By: Skincare World". These are the Amazon resellers that are not authorized.  As for my review I just bought it so I will update this once I have tested it out. just giving this five stars in hopes that others will see this.

Bought this from local dermatologist’s office. It was priced the same. I’m leaving a review to let online purchasers know that the bottle should, indeed, have a lot number on the bottom. Expiration date should be at least one year far out (indicates fresher product).  As for the “this made me break-out” reviews, why leave a one star review? If it doesn’t work for you, move on to the next product. Life is full of trial and error. We all heard it before: “Correlation doesn’t equal causation.” You broke out, and that sucks. Ask yourself if it’s truly the sunscreen or one of the other hundreds of products you’re using. Let’s face it, you ARE using a hundred other products. It could very well be this sunscreen, but it’s a reputable brand that works for most people, not all people. Skin is delicate—some more delicate than others.  Long story short, use Elta Md’s physician locator tool (on their website) to find an office that sells it to you OR buy it directly from Elta Md’s website. The cost is literally the same +- a dollar.

I have sensitive oily skin and hormonal acne. I am a brown-skinned black woman and this facial sunscreen is a godsend! It’s so hard for women with brown skin to find a sunscreen that won’t leave a whitecast or turn us grey! And the tinted ones are never our color tint. Along with my particular skin issues I thought I’d never find a good sunscreen but this product is the answer. Now that I’ve used it for a few months I can see that it does improve the quality of my skin and it seems to be reducing my blemishes slightly too though I can’t be completely sure of the latter only because I use other products to lighten blemishes as well. I use my regular moisturizer under this product and I’ve never used it alone so I can’t say whether or not it moisturizes particularly well, but like I said, I have oily skin so it’d be hard to tell if it didn’t. This product has never irritated my skin or been problematic in any way. It has a lovely, very light clean smell that reminds me of baby products. This will now be a regular staple in my skincare regime.

This product is amazing for sensitive and acne-prone skin. I have had issues in the past with sunscreens breaking me out and with Elta MD I have no worries. I have been using it for about a month now per my aesthetician. I have noticed I did go through a purge but that wasn't the only new product I was testing so it could have been a combination of the two. Now after using it a month I have noticed my skin is more hydrated (it does give you a glow) honestly some days I will just put this on and go out the door, it gives you a dewy look. Also, it goes on white but turns clear as you rub it in. I have not seen any white cast after using it. Honestly, it's so amazing you don't even need a primer before makeup, I use one but some days I skip it and there is not much of a difference. This product is worth it and I will cont. to buy it. It also has no smell and the pump on it works amazing and pumps out so smoothly. 10/10

This is different than any other product I have ever tried. I have hyper-pigmented Asian skin that has always been sensitive to sunscreens. I used to avoid wearing any because I'd break out and then have dark blemishes for months afterwards. I figured it was better to put up with the hyper pigmentation and freckles than to deal with pore clogging sunscreens. But no more! Elta MD absorbs so quickly into the skin and is silky smooth unlike traditional sunscreens that leave a white sheen till it's absorbed. The bottle says the zinc oxide is microionized which might be why it feels so different. I plan on using this product before and after IPL treatment since it hasn't caused any reaction with my skin except make it look more radiant and clear. Highly recommend for acne, sun-damaged, blemished, mid-age skin.

I got this based off numerous articles online recommending this for sensitive/rosacea prone skin. I believe everyone’s skin reacts differently and with face products you just have to go through the pain of testing. My derm no longer carries this, but derms that so may have sample sizes for free before you buy. After using this for a few weeks, I really like it. I have tried numerous mineral sunscreens and this works best under makeup. I am olive skin toned, and the fairest I’ve ever been after the pandemic, and it doesn’t leave much cast on me. If I tan some and notice this, I will update my review. The sunscreen rubs on very smooth, unlike some mineral ones that feel like grainy and uncomfortable to rub on. I think it is very moisturizing and don’t put moisturizer on with this, even though I am fighting dry skin. I have worn this to a pool with a hat, while on skin treatment that makes me more prone to sun sensitive skin, and I didn’t get any color/redness (but I reapplied faithfully). I think this product is definitely worth trying to see if it is a match for you if you are looking for a new daily sunscreen. Best of luck!

Life changing product. No white cast on bare skin or under foundation and much better results with prescription HYDROQUINONE/retinoid mix. Absolutely no sensation on skin or eyes. I use warm color foundations in light to medium beige range and get no white cast and use plenty of product. I noticed a positive change in results of skin lightening in 2 days. IPL and 6% HYDROQUINONE were giving me middling results as I get older. This product is helping me get results I got when I was younger. I have sensitive skin and eyes and have no problems with Elta. I've used various sunblocks, including LaRoche Posay physical and chemical. ELTA MD is far superior.

Just when I found the perfect tinted daily sunscreen, Elta MD tinted, along came Covid and face masks. The tint is great but there is no way to wear it with a mask and not end up with stains on the inside. So, I tried the Elta MD UV Clear, SPF 46. Perfection! For some reason, anything with zinc oxide stays on the surface of my skin making me look as white as Morticia Adams. Somehow, Elta MD has found a way to provide great protection that is truly clear. And it isn't greasy. Other sunscreens leave your hands so oily it's hard to open bottles or insert contact lenses, even after washing your hands. I love this product! When we are free from masks again, I will also use the tinted. But the clear is fabulous. I highly recommend it.

My dermatologist suggested this to me. I have tried tons of sunscreen... TONS, all price points and all brands. I prefer physical blockers but they never mesh with my makeup, make me so greasy (and I'm already oily/combo), or leave a ghostly white cast on my deep brown skin. This absorbs easily, has no strong fragrance, plays well with makeup and moisturize, is still effective is Houston summer heat and humidity, and doesn't trigger my adult acne. I haven't had issues with the pump, I like that I can pump out a lot or a little but. It is not clear - it does leave a slight white cast on my skin, however It does dissipate and I always use at least powder to make my skin more even and absorb the oilies.

I received a full-size bottle of this in one of the Allure "bonus" beauty boxes. I have pale, sensitive skin with rosacea and occasional eczema, so sunscreen is a must, but I've had allergic reactions to so many.  This is my holy grail for a daily sunscreen, meaning for days when I'm outside for no more than a few hours. (A dedicated day in the sun means I use Japanese sunscreen with a higher SPF, and I reapply). My sunscreen rule is that I wear it on my face if I'll be outside for more than 10 minutes between 10am and 4pm.  EltaMD does the trick. It's moisturizing and non-irritating. I have yet to get a sunburn while using it.  DOES IT LEAVE A WHITE CAST?  Not on me, BUT I'm quite fair-skinned. I start by applying one full pump to my face and quickly blending that in. Then I do a few small pumps to cover my ears and part of my neck.* A few more small pumps to get extra product for my nose, my cheekbones, and any spot on my face that didn't get enough from the first application.  I haven't measured how much I use, but the overall amount is comparable to recommended "nickel-sized dollops" or "edamame bean."  If you are not fair-skinned, this might leave a white cast if you are using the correct amount for your face.  *I use a cheaper sunscreen on the rest of my neck, because it doesn't react the way my face does.

I've tried about 1,000 sunscreens, and to date, this is the ONLY one I can happily put on under my makeup. Usually sunscreen either causes me to break out or causes my makeup to break down. Neither one is cute. But this stuff I use! and I don't mind applying it. It doesn't leave me face greasy or sticky, just a moment of whiteness and shine, and then nothing. Then it's easy to put on my foundation, or leave my face bare. The best sunscreen is one that you actually use, and I have no issue putting this one on. I have not tested it under harsh conditions (all day sun or inclement weather, sport, etc.) but I needed an everyday sunscreen that didn't make me cringe to wear it. I tried EltaMD UV Physical SPF 41 Tinted Mineral Sunscreen and was not as happy with it. For me, this is much better. But most of that is shade related. That wasn't a good match. I have fair skin with redness, lots of sensitivity and no issue with trying less expensive or more expensive brands. The only one that came close in terms of happiness was the La Roche Posay Anthelios, and I would pick this over that.

I'm a fair skinned lady& didn't notice any "white tint" left behind. Skin cancers run in my family, so everyday sunscreen is a must. This is by far the one I like the most. My dermatologist recommended it initially, but I ran from the price and found some by a cheaper brand& just suffered through the ever greasy feeling of protection. I finally bit the bullet& bought it..... can I just say, it's the best?? Hands down, best product ever. No break outs, no greasy feeling or white tint left behind. I use as much as moisturizer, about 20 min before going iut&it's amazing, I don't even feel like I'm wearing it. If you make this purchase, you will not regret it.

I bought this mostly because Curology recommended it and it didn't cost $50+ per bottle. I was previously using Sun Bum SPF 30, which worked pretty well for me overall.  Anyway, getting into EltaMD's SPF 46 (such a random number!) for faces...  Did it have a strange smell? Yes, but as long as you're not getting super intimate with people, nobody is going to notice the smell. It's not that strong smelling.  Does it leave a slight white shadow on my face? Yes, but overall, it absorbs pretty well for being SPF 46. Again, usually I use 30 or even as low as 15.  When I sweat, does it burn my eyes any more than how much my own perspiration burns my eyes when I sweat? NO!!!  Does it prevent sunburn on a very sunny day in August in Florida? YES!!!!  Has it caused my acne prone skin to break out? NO!!!  Those last 3 statements are the reasons why I give this product a 5 star review. Works just as well if not better than Sun Bum, and burns my eyes less than Sun Bum.

I find it interesting reading reviews because many times one contradicts the next one. I have been using this product for many years first recommended by a dermatologist. I have cystic acne which is not impacted by the product. I find the sunscreen relatively light, not greasy, very little fragrance, and only see white patches if I use too much. I put it on every morning after washing my face and before putting on makeup. It does not effect how my makeup goes on and I don't use a moisturizer in the morning. I reapply if I am going out in the sun for an extended period of time. My daughter is now using it too. I bought the face and body version for summer time and it worked well.

Was wary because of reviews saying the product would not be authentic, but did some research and saw that EltaMD does have Amazon as an authorized seller now. I received an authentic product in February 2019. As for the sunblock itself, it feels nice! It has a more greasy feel going on than the Asian milky ones like Biore, so it feels moisturizing, but the greasiness goes away after rubbing into the skin, unlike Neutrogena. No scent and no white cast even though it's a physical sunscreen!

Short review: Great for sensitive skin and does not clogs my pores. Pump once, a little bit of product goes a long way. No greasy residue on me. Worth the money. Wish it was cruelty free though. Does not moisturize much but does not dry out either. Helps a bit with oily areas in face like t-zone.  Long review: I was recommended this product by my friend who struggles with acne-prone skin. I don’t struggle as much with acne as I do with just sensitive skin in general, but she said this would be great for that too and I’m glad I listened. I spent so much time doing research and trying to find a more affordable one that would work for my skin and after trying some, they would all make me break out or turn my skin red. I finally caved and purchased this sunscreen and although I wish it was cruelty free, I can say that it is worth the money. After wearing it for two months, I can see a difference in my skin complexion. My pores do not clog like they did with other facial spf and doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy residue. I will say though that a little goes a long way so careful when you pump, not to pump too much or it will go to waste. Learned that the hard way. Also, I have dry skin for the most part and it doesn’t moisturize it much for me but doesn’t dry it out either. I apply my usual moisturizer then the sunscreen. The sunscreen has oil-absorbing ingredients that help me around my chin, my pinky oily area since I have to wear a mask for work all day and been breaking out around my chin as a result. Overall, I would recommend. It’s like the perfect mix for people with dry and oily skin, it’s crazy how good it works for both skin types, and unless I find a cheaper sunscreen that works as good or better than this, I won’t be switching any time soon.

I've tried a lot of stuff cuz my skin is pretty sensitive, and hands down, the best sunscreen I’ve tried is EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46. It’s mineral-based, fragrance-free, contains lactic acid and hyaluronic acid, which keep my skin super hydrated and smooth. EltaMD doesn't leave a white cast (still wait at least 10 min before applying makeup) and sits well under makeup. Some people swear by the tinted one, but I was not too fond of it. I'm picky about my sunscreen because I had stage 3 melanoma in my late 20s (thanks, tanning beds), so now I’m skincare obsessed, and surprisingly I've been able to reverse most of the sun damage!

I grew up in South Florida and lived in the Florida Keys and spent most of my life in the sun. I never used sunscreen on my face. At 66 years of age I decided it was time to have a sunscreen on my face. My dermatologist recommended this one. I use it every day now over top of my moisturizer. It took a while but my skin looks so much more amazing and healthy now. I would not go out in the sun without it on. It makes a huge difference. It’s a little pricey for most people but this little bottle last a really long time. You don’t need much. I put little dots all over my face it is very moisturizing and spreads easily

Love this sunscreen! Bought it last June 2019 at a dermatology office after trying my cousin's bottle. I used almost every day since then on face, neck, upper chest & ears and it lasted til 2 months ago. Bought current bottle on Amazon & it works just as well. I am very oily skinned and this doesnt make me too much oilier. I love that even though it says its not water resistant, I can put it on & go out for the day & even jogging and still not get burned. (I nornally burn very easily and have had 2 skin cancers surgically removed in the past). It has just enough white tone to it to tone down my reddish colored skin tone, which I like, because normally I wear a light foundation to tone down the red. The texture is an easy-to-spread lotion unlike some of the thick zinc sunscreens.

This was a recommendation on a website as a good SPF moisturizer that doesn’t clog your pores. I didn’t really read too much about it, just ordered it and started slapping it on. It’s not super thick and does make my skin a little shiny at first, although not as bad as others do. After a couple days, my skin started clearing up and my first thought was that I should have started using SPF years ago if this was the result of blocking UV rays! Then I saw it had niacinamide in it, haha. Well, it works! I’ve tried other niacinamide products before and none of them have given me the results that this SPF moisturizer does. It’s on the pricier side, but I have no problems shelling out for it as long as this is the result...especially since my skin hadn’t been doing so great with all the extra mask wearing.

After watching a TikTok from @whatsonvisface she recommended this product. I decided to try it because her skin is amazing. I was hesitant about the price at first because I'm cheap. I think it will last me 4-6 months of one time daily use honestly. I have combination skin. I can apply this immediately after my shower and it absorbs within 5 minutes. I usually get oily halfway through the day with most products, however I can go ALL DAY without my T-zone becoming oily with this! It spreads like freaking butter! The amount shown on my fingers can easily be used on my face and neck. The smell isn't overbearing like most sunscreens. I had issues with other sunscreens melting into my eyes and burning but haven't had any issues with this one yet. Doesn't make my face shiny AT ALL or feel sticky EVER. I will be buying this from now on unless I get a better one for free! lol  These are the sunscreens I've tried - Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF 25, Neutrogena Clear Face sunscreen lotion SPF 55 oil-free and there was another generic kind from Walmart. Hydro Boost was expensive for how much I had to use. Clear face made my face oily all day.

I originally bought it to help with my rosacea and wow it really did! I can't say enough good things about this moisturizer. It absorbs in the skin quickly, doesn't really have a smell and has a great consistency. If you have rosacea, this product really helps to put that protective barrier over your face to bring down the redness. I first use a hyaluronic acid serum when my face is damp and then I'll seal it in with this lotion and it's a really good combo! The only thing thing I'm not super fond of is it can look really white on your skin if you don't rub it in but that's because it's a mineral sunscreen and any sunscreen would do that but to be fair, the whiteness disappears pretty quickly.

I seriously wish I would have found this facial sunscreen years ago; I'm sure my face would look better now if I had. I'm 41 and struggle with sensitive facial skin and brown sun/aging spots on my face from years of unprotected sun exposure - before I knew better! I hated putting sunscreen on my face because it always felt so gross and was almost impossible to put make up over. I also didn't know there were 2 types of sunscreens - chemical and mineral. I have been using chemical all over my face for years. No wonder I hated it so much. Not only is this sunscreen the much safer mineral kind, but it's so easy to spread evenly over my face and it leaves no white residue. It also doesn't feel greasy or oily and my powder make up easily goes over it. I will use this sunscreen on my face and my daughter's face forever! I'll never buy anything different. I highly recommend this sunscreen. I can see why it has so many high reviews - it's the best out there!

I previously purchased this about a year ago and I feel like I received a counterfeit product.  A couple weeks ago, I repurchased. I've used it every day since and my skin had no negative reactions. This sunscreen does not pill or irritate my acne prone/redness prone skin. It did sting a bit for the first couple days but not anymore.  I do not think it clogs my pores as much as other sunscreens. I really love this product. I have no deal complaints at all!  I highly recommend this if you're acne prone and oily. It's probably the best for humid environments but this is a solid sunscreen. I'm rating it a 9 out of 10. I don't think I've ever loved another sunscreen this much.

I never thought much about applying sunscreen to my fact just to run out to the mail box and back. Now I do. Whether you have had a skin-cancer or not, this item was highly recommended to me as a really good sunscreen protection for the face, and to wear it every time I go outside. It has SPF46, is very light weight when applied, smooth and not sticky. Once applied you don't even feel it on your face and I really like that. I use it by itself sometimes, or with moisturizer alone and also with makeup. It's a smaller pump container than I expected for the price but I found very quickly that you don't need a whole lot to cover your face. A little dab of this protection goes a long way and you are worth it!

I’m not one to write reviews but I’ve been telling myself ever since I bought this sunscreen, I must write one. Let me start off by saying I have sensitive skin that is easily prone to hyperpigmentation/ rosacea. Also, I’ve always dreaded and (unfortunately, avoided) putting sunscreen on my face my whole life. I hated how much greasier my already greasy skin looked. I disliked the smell, how it felt, everything. Fast forward to using this sunscreen and I ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING IT ON. I’ve even applied it on days I don’t plan to go outside because of how moisturizering it is, my skin comes alive when I apply it. There’s no strong smell, I sometimes have allergic reactions to perfume-y smells. It’s not greasy. DOESN’T leave your face white like other sunscreens ( very confused by any comments which say it does). I swear it makes my skin look good once I apply it, plump and more even toned skin, this stuff is magic (who agrees?!) It’s summer so when I ran out and was waiting for my order I noticed my skin was getting back to what it used be before I discovered this - hyperpigmented due to the sun. So now I know for sure this sunscreen is why my skin has looked better than any past summers. Because of all the pros, I do not mind paying this much for sunscreen. I’m a product lover, I enjoy researching the best products for everything and try many until I find The One and this right here is one of my all time favorite products I own.

for reference i have acne prone skin with dry patches, rosacea, redness, pores, scars, hyperpigmentation, and im slightly sensitive. i break out normally on my chin and jaw as well as some areas on my neck and forehead. I’ve been using this for years. it’s the only SPF that doesn’t cling to dry patches, break me out, irritate my skin, clog my pores, and doesn’t give a white cast. sooo easy to blend into the skin, and so moisturizing but not heavy! makeup sits very nicely on top of it!! This is one of my favorite skin care products. i’ve rotated certain products throughout my skin care journey but this is a die hard for me.. i never had any problems purchasing it through amazon and will continue to do so.

As a longtime Elta MD user, I can say the product I received is the real deal. My bottle arrived in a sealed box that had the batch# and Expiration date on the bottom. The bottle has the correct nozzle top as well as the batch# and expiration date on the bottom. The UV clear (both tinted & clear) is my ride or die MUST HAVE daily moisturizer. I love that it does so beautifully under makeup that it can truly double as a primer! That was a fabulous tip I received from my esthetician who is also a makeup artist. This stuff is loaded with antioxidants & other skin-loving ingredients. Elta MD UV- Clear is worth every penny!!!!

I purchased this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist. I suffer from rosacea and need to use SPF on the daily. I was a bit leery given the price but decided to try it. So glad I did! It is light, has no scent and goes on like moisturizer. It leaves NO white cast. In fact it’s moisturizing and doesn’t have any heaviness to it which will be good for summer. Most rosacea sufferers have to use mineral sunscreens to avoid irritating our already sensitive skin. Most mineral sunscreens are not this cosmetically elegant. This is a keeper for sure!

Very expensive for the amount you get so I can’t afford to buy it again but my honest opinion follows.  I was recommended this product by my dermatologist as I have melasma and oily skin. I’ve given up on sunscreens because they were like wearing greasy cake makeup. Even the ones for oily skin were an odd texture. Well this product is a lifesaver or shall I say skin saver! The texture is amazing, it’s high quality and my skin loves it! It is not greasy and does not feel like it’s a thick coat on my skin. I’m in Aesthetics school and I was telling my friend about it and two people in class chimed in with how much they love the product too. They have acneic skin and have no issues with this breaking them out. I will continue to buy this product. So happy I was introduced to it!

I bought this after watching recommendations and reviews from Dr. Dray, a board-certified Dermatologist on YouTube. I purchase many of the products she talks about; however, for the price, I was a little hesitant about this product.  I’m glad to say I’m completely blown away and will be purchasing more! While the size may not “look” the most impressive, the ingredients in it, including mineral sunscreens, are perfect for blocking BOTH UVA AND UVB. I commute to work and while the windshield of the car may block one of the two, it does not block the non burning, AGING UV rays. I apply this every morning after my morning facial routine which includes Tretinoin 0.1%. Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative and is hundreds times stronger than retinol, such as from Olay, L’Oréal, etc. and is FDA APPROVED for anti-aging. The caveat is it makes your skin extremely sensitive to the sun and sunburn.  This sunscreen alone is moisturizing and provides great coverage for me. It is not nearly as pasty white as other sunscreens and creates a bit of a “primer” effect by blurring pores and giving your skin a bright, not white, appearance. Occasionally I’ll add a pure mineral sunscreen under my eyes for further protection and help with any dark circles (I’m a night shift Registered Nurse and work 3 12hr shifts in a row) and let it sit while I drive and then rub it into the rest of my face. I have not experienced any breakouts or issues with this product and one pump of the container is more than enough for your face; however, two pumps is perfect for my face, décolleté, and hands as I commute to the hospital.  When I am close to running out I will most definitely order more as it seems to last much longer than expected and works as a great moisturizer (all sunscreens are moisturizers really...), sunscreen, and primer.

Couldn't find a lot of stores that sold this brand of sunscreen online. Glad that I found this on Amazon and hoping it's real/legit! It's always scary buying beauty or skin care products and not wanting a knock off that will ruin your skin. So far I'm loving this product. It feels smooth on my skin and no heavy fragrance. I am pleased with the product and see why it's so highly recommended by dermatologists. Was doing my research and was hesitant with the price point compared to other name brand face sunscreen products but this seems worth it.

I’m obsessed with skincare products, especially trying new sunscreens for my face. I’ve tried many, many face sunscreens, and the EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen is the best one I’ve ever used.  It’s great for sensitive skin, and contains only FA-safe ingredients, if that’s a concern for you. It’s moisturizing and contains niacinamide, which is great for brightening skin and improving overall texture/evenness. It doesn’t sit too heavy on your face either, so you can apply makeup over it without any issues. Absolutely no pilling either, unless you’re applying it over a thicker serum, like niacinamide, but any sunscreen would pill over niacinamide. It layers beautifully over my morning vitamin C serum.  I’m literally only ever buying this face sunscreen in the future. It’s a little pricy, but it has high SPF protection (SPF 46 should block at least 97% of UVA/UVB rays) and is so comfortable on my face that I forget it’s there. I recommend this to anyone, but especially people with sensitive skin!

I have tried over 30 brands of sunscreen this year alone. This is my top pic. This is moisturizing, gentle on my skin even though I have super sensitive skin. It helps with my redness and I’m shocked it’s not a physical sunscreen. Usually chemical sunscreens irritate me. It doesn’t work as well as zinc oxide (physical), but it has zero white cast. And where I didn’t notice a difference in my skin tone immediately, I did notice a significant decrease in my redness after 2 weeks.  I see reviews that say this is counterfeit, I bought this here and 1 from the brands site directly, used 1 on each side of my face and both felt and performed the same. They also had the same expiration date and packaging.

I adore this sunscreen... defo in my top 3. I wear spf 365 days per year from sun up to sun down. Rain or shine, winter or summer. I also reapply during day. This ran dry exactly one month after I purchased it. I do not reapply using the same; I have many awesome sunscreens in the rotation (2 other faves are biore aqua rich & supergoop superscreen). This still ran out sooo quick. I will buy again though. I am 41, normal skin, like when sunscreens are absorbed into nothing feeling or looking, don’t make me shiny (or less common, dry me out) and of course offer amazing sun protection!

Best facial sunblock that was used daily by all members of the family during our 11 day road trip, which included hikes, beach, rafting and just lounging about. It was applied to two adults and 2 smaller children to face, ears and neck. No one burned, and all 4 of us would. Left so streaks or we all tanned a shade or two. I personally used it above moisturizer and under light foundation. Otherwise, everyone just wore after a quick face wash. Easy to reapply. I actually forgot to apply to myself on our last day, and now my forehead nose and upper cheeks are burned red. I appreciate the zinc oxide, the packaging and pump, ease of application, quick absorption, and minimal white cast.
