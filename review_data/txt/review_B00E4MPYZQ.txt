This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I can’t be more happy with it. I used to used sunscreen lotion and would always breakout with small little whiteheads on my cheeks. Dr said it is because the lotion clogs the pores. This is made with alcohol and that is the secret to not breaking out anymore. Whenever I go in the sun I need to use this and it works great.

I mistakenly ordered the wrong SPF and the SPF 30 is a very greasy sunscreen that has alcohol in it. It burns my skin and leaves it looking shiny and feeling sticky.  I contacted the company about returning the unused bottles in the order and they were very helpful. I would order from them again but be careful I order the correct item.

I am bald. For years I avoided using sunscreen on my head because the creamy sunscreens blocked my pores and thus left my head hot and sweaty. The alcohol gel base of the Solbar 30 does not block the pores and once applied I am not even aware of having sunscreen on my head. I have used Solbar 30 now for about 3 years and will continue to do so into the future.

Not greasy.

Not good for the face because it smells too much like alcohol. I use it on my body but it starts to peel off easily if you rub it in too much. It doesn't fully absorb into the skin. I like to use it for pool or beach days.

Great product. Good protection and easy application - without any "greasy" residue on hands. Apply smoothly and when alcohol evaporates, you will have the protection remaining. Recommend by my dermatologist.

I love solar. I prefer the gel over the cream. I don’t feel like I’m covered in heavy sunblock. I have very fair and sensitive skin. The gel goes on easy snd it light. Best sun protection I’ve ever used. Was recommended by my dermatologist in the 90’s

I have sensitive skin, this goes on like a gel, dries quickly and last for so long even in the ocean after hours of play. This will be my "go to" sunscreen from now on in.

I heard great reviews about this sunscreen. But I was so so disappointed when I received it. All three bottles had a 6/20 expiration date. I ordered it on June 2020.

Recommended by my dermatologist. Said he uses it himself. That's good enough for me. Non-greasy which I love.

A good product for me.

One of three bottles was liquid. They promptly replaced it. However this one was also liquid.

Like they gel Good absorption

The best protection from sunburn.

I was told by my dermatologist to buy thus because it was alcohol based and went on easily. On that count he was correct. About 10 hours after I had this on it transferred to my eyes and I could not see for about 10-15 minutes. Luckily I don't wear contact lens anymore. I live in a hot humid climate so I am sort of holding back.

Not oily or greasy. Recommended by my dermatologist as I’ve had some skin cancer.
