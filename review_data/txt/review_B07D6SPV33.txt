It’s awesome. I used different products before. It really works. I used it for my 3 years old daughter and she was on the swimming pool 4 hours without any burning or red skin. It’s easy to use and she loves it.

I like this sunscreen spray. I don’t love chemical sunscreen but since we are not in heavy sunny weather usually I think it’s fine to use. I love that it’s fragrance free and easy to use on my toddler.

I love this sunscreen. We have so many allergies to beauty products and this is the only sunscreen to accommodate that doesn't leave a white film. Easy to apply!

All three people who used this at the beach got burned. Yes, we reapplied. I've never had sunscreen that just plain didn't work before. Very disappointing.
