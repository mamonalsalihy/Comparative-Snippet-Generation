All three people who used this at the beach got burned. Yes, we reapplied. I've never had sunscreen that just plain didn't work before. Very disappointing.

I like this sunscreen spray. I don’t love chemical sunscreen but since we are not in heavy sunny weather usually I think it’s fine to use. I love that it’s fragrance free and easy to use on my toddler.

I love this sunscreen. We have so many allergies to beauty products and this is the only sunscreen to accommodate that doesn't leave a white film. Easy to apply!

It’s awesome. I used different products before. It really works. I used it for my 3 years old daughter and she was on the swimming pool 4 hours without any burning or red skin. It’s easy to use and she loves it.
