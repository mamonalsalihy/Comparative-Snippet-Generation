This sunscreen leaves your face feeling fresh and dewy after only a pea-sized application. A little goes a long way and I can attest to that since mine took 4-6 months to get emptied out. What I really like about this sun gel is that itâ€™s non-greasy and it really protects my face from the heat of the sun. Girls, it does not only have SPF but youâ€™ll faint to know that it also has a TPF (Triple Protection) factor that regulates the overheating and the temperature of your skin because youâ€™re so damn HOT girl! Let me also tell you that it does not give you a white cast so they wonâ€™t have you mistaken for a friend of Casper. No need to reapply. When I come home from a long day out, I notice that my skin still gives out that glowy and youthful complexion. I donâ€™t even have to wear a thousand layers of highlighter to make me look like one of the K-pop idols. I received countless compliments (even from my haters) because of this sunscreen especially when mixed with the Boscia Tsubaki Glotion. What I love: non-greasy, mineral sunscreen, has anti-aging formula that prevents heat-aging, good for sensitive skin, no irritation and no breakouts, no strong smell, easy to pump, results to matte finish, quick lock-in, healthy glow & dewiness are attainable

LOVE this stuff! I had done extensive product research before buying yet ANOTHER sunscreen for my face. I hate the smell, the greasiness, the white halo effect BUT this stuff had none of that!! I was bracing myself despite the glowing reviews. I have very dry skin due to Sjogren's and I have mature skin on top of it so I was looking for something that would blend with my moisturizers, this does. It goes on smooth and shiny, no smell. The shine dissipates once it sets. I now have my sun screen.

I have very sensitive skin that reddens easily. Mineral sunscreens leave a horrid white cast and feel like I am wearing stage makeup. Chemical sunscreens make my skin and eyes burn. This is the FIRST chemical sunscreen that I am delighted to wear and apply it every day and have been recommending it to all of my friends with similar skin issues. I can wear with or without makeup. My skin is combination oily so no matter what I do--apply primer or whatever--by day's end any makeup I have on is floating on my face. This has humectants that keep the skin moist throughout the day.

Always be careful buying skincare online that the seller selected is authorized. I love that Credithink is an authorized seller and includes samples! This is my favorite sunscreen for daily use - I just bought a backup after finishing half of my first bottle. It does not feel heavy or greasy, and I can actually use the necessary amount for protection. While it is somewhat hydrating, I always use a full skincare routine with moisturizer underneath. It does leave skin very dewy, which could be good or bad depending on preference (I don't mind). There is some fragrance, but it does not irritate my very sensitive skin. Great base for makeup - I do not need an additional primer.

So disappointed to see they repackaged the same sunscreen going from 2.53 oz to 1.69 oz, went from a great pump to a squeeze tube, and didn't reduce the price to match! What the heck? No longer worth it.

This is my favorite dewy sunscreen. It makes you GLOW and looks amazing under makeup. It doesnâ€™t pill or make your foundation look weird. If youâ€™re wearing a matte foundation, it makes it look more satin, which is perfect on those days when you have dry skin and donâ€™t want all of your dry patches to show. Please note that if you like a matte finish, you probably wonâ€™t enjoy this particular product.  Not only is it amazing in terms of dewiness and makeup compatibility, it also does a terrific job at protecting you from the sun! I once went on a hike and slathered this all over my face but forgot my neck. 3 hours later, my neck was toast but my face was still dewy, moisturized, and most importantly, NOT burned.

I have fairly dry skin so I like to layer a decent number of moisturizing skincare products. This sunscreen applied on top pretty well, and although it was still moist it wasn't unbearably oily. You'll be glowy for like 20-30 minutes but it sets closer to normal skin. I haven't tried it on top of heavier night-time occlusives, but I'm pretty happy with the results since it didn't pill at all (my number one issue with most sunscreens including Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV and COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream). For reference, I used it on top of Stratia Liquid Gold and COSRX Honey Overnight Mask. I also deal with mild seborrheic dermatitis flares and it didn't irritate my skin. The product pump dispenser is more hygienic than the standard sunscreen, and 75 mL is a good amount of product. Plus it's reef-safe!

Me gusta la textura pero siento que es un poco aceitoso, tengo piel grasa y vivo en clima hÃºmedo, aveces no tengo ni que usar hidratante porque este ya es bastante humectante, deja la piel muy glowy, lo Ãºnico malo es que al pasar de las horas si se siente la piel con mÃ¡s grasita, creo que para el precio estÃ¡ algo costoso, me quedo con el daily de A'pieu que cuesta la mitad, ademÃ¡s siento que me sensibiliza los ojos lo cual no me encanta. Lo Ãºnico bueno es que su fÃ³rmula se lleva bien con todos mis productos y no me hace rollos o efecto borrador, pero si estÃ¡ algo caro.

I liked it so much that Iâ€™ve purchased it 3 times! What happened to the scent!? In 2019, I smelled the soft notes of my Nanaâ€™s favorite department store cream- twice! In 2020, I smell wet grass! Why??????? Is this fragrance less costly? Was there a problem with supply lines due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Scent matters in a daily SPF!!!!!!! SPF moisturizer is crucial to my morning routine. I am devastated!!!! (Replacement attempted. And failed; CeraVe oil free lacks absorbability and texture).

I have sensitive skin and have spent a fortune on "medical grade" sunscreens that either, irritate my skin, burn my skin, and/or just don't protect me from the sun. This was given to me a gift and I LOVE it. FINALLY, I have a sunscreen lotion that works, and makes my skin look hydrated, and smooth. Seriously, this is a great product and I would highly, highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin. :)

I purchased this sunscreen last summer (2018) and I've had plenty of opportunities to use it. This is one of my favorite sunscreens! I prefer sunscreens with chemical filters because they're just easier to wear and reapply. This one melts into skin quickly and gifts me a dewy look. Also contains one of my favorite ingredients: niacinamide!  ***However, BEWARE OF THE FREE GIFTS. The free travel size sunscreen I received EXPIRED IN 2004! It expired 15 years ago!!!!!! How ridiculous is that??? I would not have even realized if I didn't notice the "off" smell. If you're choosing this seller because of the free gifts, just know that the free gifts are worthless. Fortunately the actual sunscreen expires in 10/2020.

i have super oily skin that is shiny after just an hour of my morning routine. this gel doesn't irritate and make my face greasy. no whitecast or weird chemical smell either and wears very well under makeup. it's a very light moisturizer so it should be layered on top of something else on a non-makeup day (i currently use neutrogena hydro boost underneath). i'v been using the same bottle every morning for the past 2 months and can confidently say this is now my go-to sun protection product.

eos-eos

The best sunscreen I have ever tried - and I've tried a lot. My skin reacts badly to zinc oxide and titanium dioxide specifically, as well as a bunch of other things. I had almost given up on sunscreen altogether when I tried this one. It doesn't break me out and it absorbs without being oily or greasy. Fantastic sunscreen.

eos-eos

I have rosacea so some skin care products really don't work for me--but I need to wear sunscreen year-round. This sunscreen made it through a sweaty, outdoors days as well as under makeup/after swimming days with no hassles. And no sunburns. And no redness/tightness. I use it over my regular moisturizer and it's great. Some folks may not need anything underneath. But I haven't had clogged pores or anything. When I find a great product I stick with it.

I love Makeup P:rem JV Defense Blue Ray Sun Get. I have been using it for almost two years every day! It helps to protect my skin from dangerous sun rays as well as blue light damage. It is light non greasy, absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice light citrusy fragrance that quickly evaporates, for those who may be fragrance sensitive. I highly would recommend this to anyone looking to help prevent any sun damage to their skin as well as add anti aging benefits from a really good skin treatment.

I can't say enough about how long I've searched for a summer moisturizer like this! No white cast, no funky smell, absorbs quickly and I don't feel greasy! My skin is super sensitive and will break out in a heartbeat if it doesn't like what I put on it...... 2 months in, my skin looks great, and I'm a believer. I don't wear much make-up in the summertime, so I couldn't tell you if it pills or not. I adore this product!!!

eos-eos

This leaves a shiny glow on my face! Personally I love it, I just matte the center of my face with powder after, and leave my cheeks unpowdered for that glowly look. Smells like natural flowers, love the consistency too. Melts into the skin without a whitecast because this is a chemical sunscreen. I use 3 pumps for my face.

Iâ€™m loving K beauty! Been using K products about 2 years. I love this stuff! It seems kind of greasy at first and you glowðŸ˜‚. After about 15 minutes the glow is pretty much gone which is perfect for summer. If u have combo skin, get this! The spreadbility factor is great. Itâ€™s transparent so no white cast going on. This was a great buy and I WILL be buying again.

Tried this and all the samples since December. It made my skin sooooo soft and smooth wow . I think it does help to keep my face calm from self heating while I wear it . I put it on under my make up it doesn't interfere with anything . I have extremely sensitive skin and it hasn't given me out of the ordinary black heads or pimples .

I canâ€™t tell you how many face sunscreens Iâ€™ve bought, trying to find one that didnâ€™t break me out â€” even the most expensive ones. This is the only one that doesnâ€™t give me zits and is still adequately moisturizing for my sensitive skin.

eos-eos

This spf is hands down the best. Not greasy at all, perfect texture, no white cast and works great under makeup! Also it isnt hard to remove as well.

eos-eos

I M really enjoying this sunscreen. It is so gentle and light on my skin compared to many others Iâ€™ve used. It still allows my skin to breath, and the heat doesnâ€™t get trapped beneath the surface, which in the past years when the heat does get trapped, has lead to hives.

This is a great sunscreen offering good protection through octinoxate (the second ingredient) and Uvinul A-Plus, both of which are chemical, not physical, ingredients. This sunscreen is not a physical or mineral sunscreenâ€”it contains no zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. It is a great choice for anti-aging, but if youâ€™re looking for a mineral sunscreen, this ainâ€™t it!

eos-eos

I love this one since it makes my skin dewy without being greasy. One of my top fave sunscreens !!!!!

eos-eos

I was on a search to find a sunscreen that wasn't sticky but gave my skin a moisturizing feeling and this was it. It gives my skin a natural light sheen without it being sticky or feeling thick on the skin. My husband who of course doesnt like to wear any sunscreen because of it's known stickiness likes to wear this one. Will definitely order again!

I discovered this product through a magazine article in which a Korean lady professional golfer carries this sunscreen in her bag. So far, I like how it feels on my skin--keeps cool and non-greasy--and I really like its scent. I'm looking forward to testing how it does in the long run.

This product is definitely the best I've ever used. I have very sensitive skin and this feels so good on my skin. I 100% recommend this for everyone who wants a high quality facial sunscreen for sensitive skin. After applying to the face it leaves no white cast but my face does glow only for 5minutes or so and then it dries out and back to normal. I love this product.

eos-eos

I bought this on the recommendation that it doesn't interfere with makeup application. It's so true. I spent a lot of money over the years looking for a face sunscreen that doesn't turn me into an oil slick or change the appearance of my base makeup. It's not the cheapest, but it's the first facial sunscreen I have ever used that doesn't interfere with any of my skincare or makeup products!

This super thin Gel like formula rubs in like a dream and bonus - doesnâ€™t sting around my eyes! Perfect For oily/combo and awesome base for makeup - I live in the south and SPF is a must! Love this and have purchased multiple times - give it a try especially if you have oily skin!

It has a very light texture. It doesn't leave any white thick residue on your face. It keeps your skin moisture, not sticky I love this product!

I have tried many sunscreen, might as well have been a professional reviewer. This is by far the best, non greasy, hint of fragrance -very light and fresh, sunscreen I've encountered. Beautiful selected list of ingredients, nourishing while secured from Sun, as well as, computer light.

Finally a nice light SPF that can be used by someone who has a darker skin tone. Oh, and this SPF does not leave that nasty white residue. For years Iâ€™ve had to add drops of a liquid luminizer to avoid that whole ghostly look.

I love the texture of this cream. It's unlike any other face cream I've tried with spf - it's feels very light on the face and is mosturizing as well. I ended up buying this after a lot of recommendations and agree this is great for sensitive skin

This is the best sunscreen I've found in the US. It leaves no white case, soaks in easily and wears well under makeup. I will definitely be buying this one again.

I really like this sunscreen. I have used the sun capsule (yellow cap) in the past and liked it as well. This one is a lotion that leaves no wits cast. I used it on vacation in Florida and didnâ€™t get burned.

Omg! The most important thing is that it doesnâ€™t leave a white residue.... very light in texture and doesnâ€™t leave me shiny...
