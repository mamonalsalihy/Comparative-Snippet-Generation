We were going to Hawaii and our daughter suggested this sun screen. Glad to know it is reef friendly, and it protected us very well!

Horrible. My face was left so rough after the 3rd use.DO NOT BUY IT!! It burned my skin horribly and left me with dry patchy areas!! My face was so soft and smooth and now itâ€™s so rough! Very upset.

We use a lot of sunscreen during the summer, and this one is easy to apply, lasts for a long time, and has a pleasant scent. It is also reef-friendly, which is a bonus. We did switch to sprays for a while, but I just feel better with a lotion sunscreen. Will continue buying this one.

Unlike many other sunscreens, this one does not leave a white cast on my face after applying.

I am a Professional Beach Bum and use alot of suntan lotion. Thought I would try something new, so I purchased this product because of the detailed description. Yes, it is easy to use, but the smell is awful. The good news, after awhile the smell disappears.

I love this sunscreen. SPF 70 has plenty of protection. It feels nicer on my skin than any other sunscreen ever! My skin is sensitive to many products. It doesnâ€™t feel sticky or greasy after just a minute or two. I even use it in my face!

Went to a resort and wore this sunscreen and developed a horrible contact dermatitis with neck swelling that I blamed on chlorine or my swimsuit. I never thought the culprit would be the sunscreen until I wore it again a month later (nowhere near water, wearing clothes Iâ€™ve worn before and wearing a hat so there was barely any sun in mu neck area)and BAM, same exact reaction!!! Will throw it in the trash ASAP

I ordered this on May 2nd and it arrived June 22nd. Thatâ€™s a long time to wait. At least itâ€™s not expired.
