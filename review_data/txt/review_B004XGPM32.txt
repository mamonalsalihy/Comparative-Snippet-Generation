The media could not be loaded. I have yet to use it outside, but as a black woman i'm glad that this sunscreen doesn't give off an ashy after-affect.

I’ve used this before and always liked it and have never had trouble...BUT this last batch must have been bad as my whole family is burnt horribly. We reapplied numerous times throughout the day but are scorched, and we used it within a few days of delivery, so wasn’t old and sitting around on our side. I’m including a few pictures showing some of us in my family....not a fun post beach day, we are in pain. What happened to the quality, was it sitting in the warehouse too long, wrong temp....not cool!! Loved before but after this not sure I can ever trust it again.

It prevents sunburns; however, if you care about the environment, know that the SPF 70 contains 6% Oxybenzone, which is banned for sale in Hawaii for killing the coral reefs. Also, it's likely not vegan due to beeswax, stearates and glycerine. The lower SPFs, however, seem to be OK in these respects. The Amazon page now seems to be clearer regarding these issues than it was when I bought it, but I'm just letting you know in case these things are important to you.

I am a pale, pale lady with majorly sensitive skin who has used probably every sunscreen product on the planet, because I love the outdoors. I've done cheap (Target, Neutrogena, Coppertone, Bullfrog), expensive (Shiseido, La Roche-Posay, MD Solarsciences, Obagi), chemical sunscreens, physical sunscreens, natural/organic sunscreens, gels, creams, sprays- you name it. Before I found this my go-to had been Banana Boat Kid SPF 50, which works really well, but leaves some major white residue on your skin and everywhere else. But it worked, so I stuck with it. Until now. This is the best. I bought it for a trip to Mexico and managed, for the first time in my life, to come back from vacation without a burn. It worked all day from one application during a completely cloudless week on the beach, even after multiple trips into the ocean. It smells pretty decent (though my one wish would be that there was a fragrance-free option). It's not too greasy and there is very minimal skin to clothing transfer. And the best part- I didn't end up looking like I was signing up for kabuki theater. It's pretty hard when you're super-pale to find a sunscreen that you can apply and forget about all day, not having to constantly worry about reapplication, trying to find a shady spot, or looking like you've just brushed white paint all over your body. I think I just found a secret weapon.

We have 4 people in our family. Two of them have fair skin and 1 of them had melanoma. We pay very close attention to skin care in the summer, escpecially since we spend most days in a pool, on a boat, or at the beach. Our daughter is the fairest skinned and we struggle every year with sunburns with her. We’ve tried every product out there and some are very good, but until now, none have been GREAT. Sun Bum is GREAT. We started using Sun Bum products this summer based on a friends recommendation. We are all in on Sun Bum products now...hair care, sunblock, etc. all of them are fantastic products. All other sunblocks will promptly be discarded. Safer than many others, great coverage & feel on your skin, smells amazing. If it’s trusted my lifeguards in Hawaii, that’s telling you something. And we can vouch for that. I’d also highly recommend the face 50...that has been a godsend for our daughter as she’s always in the water and rubbing the water away from her eyes...the sun bum 50 really stays on longest and provides the best protection we’ve found.

My husband and I went to Hawaii on our honeymoon. Few things to note: 1. I am a PASTY white girl who freckles and burns before ultimately having a tan. The sun is my mortal enemy. 2. I HATE sunscreen that isn’t a spray (normally). 3. I have VERY sensitive skin that hates most sunscreens.  This. Sunscreen. Is. The. Best. Easy to apply, easy to rub in and doesn’t feel greasy, and I actually really like the smell. My husband, who tans in 5 minutes, also really liked it. We would apply consistently during the days at the beach and neither of us burned at all! Best decision I ever made.  Note: DO RE-APPLY. This ain’t a sunscreen you can just rub and go. It needs to settle into your skin, and you need to reapply every 2 hours.  New favorite sunscreen!

eos-eos

Okay so, all I can I say is that this stuff is a great sunscreen. It smells great (my youngest son says it smells like summer :) like Banana's), doesn't leave a white film, doesn't sting mine or my families eyes, no rashes, no splotchy stuff. I feel protected and don't come home sun burned. My skin feels great and looks great. Most of the sun screens that are 30 or more SPF that I have tried... I end up with this white filmy, residue stuff that I can't rub in and that annoying factor is gone with this! It rubs in great and protects great. I have sensitive skin as does my husband. Heavy lotions and sunscreens leaves my skin feeling greasy all day and leaves behind clogged pores. Not so with Sun Bum... It's a winner!

eos-eos

The scent is very nice but I can't use it on my face. It makes my eyes water and burn. I thought it was an allergy to something else and I tried it again the next day, same thing - watery eyes and a burning feeling. And no, I didn't get it in my eyes! After washing it off my face it was fine. I can use it for my legs but have to use Neutrogena on the face. Same issue when my husband tried it, burning eyes.

My skin is super sensitive. Super. Sensitive. I am a redhead, with rosacea prone skin, and get contact dermatitis with almost every brand of chemical sunscreen on the market (I usually use barrier sunscreens.) I don't tan well and burn quickly, but hate the pasty white sheen of zinc or titanium on my skin (I'm pale enough, thank you very much.) I read good things about Sun Bum and saw that it is supposed to be hypoallergenic, so gave it a try. LOVE IT! This sunscreen brand works very, very well on my skin with no ill side effects! I swim daily and have used Sun Bum products exclusively on my face and body for two months with no burns and no break outs! The smell isn't great, but the product is.

They lie in the description. They advertise it as reef safe and say it doesn’t contain any (oxybenzone and octinoxate). I just got the bottle delivered and Octinoxate is listed as an active ingredient!!! I am very disappointed. Also I found out it can’t even be used in Hawaii since 2020 as they banned these 2 ingredients. I am returning it!!

I bought this after reading from outside sources how much safer health wise this product is. Some sunscreens are suspected of causing skin cancer, which is what we are trying to avoid. I just had melanoma removed so I'm extra concerned. This product is also coral reef friendly. There's been some issues with that in Hawaii so the FDA got involved. Sum bum is mineral based. You can read about the difference, but their product does NOT contain Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, Retinyl Palmitate, Parabens, Phthalates or Formaldehyde. Yes Formaldehyde!!! Formaldehyde is linked to cancer so decades of using it may have caused the cancerous patch on my skin. It's used as a preservative in cosmetics, baby products, nail polish, body was, shampoo, eyelash glue, and more. I will be checking my products more closely now that I know this. I got SPF 30 and it works perfectly. I spend 4 or 5 hours at the lake and my skin doesn't get burned anymore. Anyway, this is my new go to!!! Thanks Sunbum.

Holy moly this stuff did a number on my eyes. I’ll start off by saying that I wear sunscreen daily, typically I buy Blue Lizard butI thought I’d give this stuff a try since it had great reviews,big mistake. Its supposed to be gentle and hypoallergenic but my god one of my eyeballs was on fire alllllll night. It was horrendous. Now its swollen and tearing up. Never again. Im going to add i didnt get it anywhere near my eyes and washed my hands after applying. Thanks for the eye damage!

eos-eos

I love this product! While planning a trip to Hawaii, I was determined to find some new, reef-safe sunscreens. I bought a few different brands and this was by far my favorite! It was super easy to apply-not like that thick, white, glue that some of the newer sunscreens are. It smelled absolutely amazing-a fresh banana smell-not chemically. It absorbed well and didn't feel greasy. It was moisturizing and felt good on my skin. I usually don't get any color if I use spf 30, but if I use spf 15 I burn. This actually gave me a pretty deep tan-but I didn't burn at all! Seems more like a really good spf 15.

eos-eos

Do not buy this product from this vendor. We have used this product in the past as it was amazing. This time, the bottle appeared slightly different and we just assumed it was a mfg defect. Lesson learned, we used this product on our vacation this week and all of us who used this vendors product got extremely bad sun burns. We even thought it was maybe us not applying it enough, so the next day we swapped it up on different people within our group, some used this and some used another brand we brought with us. Same results, those who used this product got burnt.

I live in Florida so very likely I wear sunscreen more often than most, and even though it was part of my life routine for so long, I never realized the effect just any sunscreen had on my skin. I think it was supposed to leave my skin dry, it was supposed to leave a cast, it was supposed to be hard to spread. I realize this is an art! But I am pretty low maintenance and just wanted the protection. I’ll tell you, now that I’ve bought this Sun Bum product, I get it now! This stuff has that standard coconut smell, which I’m meh about, BUT, it spreads easily, makes my skin feel good, it’s reef friendly and generally speaking it’s nice to use. Will be my go to moving forward! Def give it a try.

I got to put this stuff to the test pretty quickly, as my wife and I went on honeymoon in Tanzania, where we were met with constant sunlight and 90 degree weather. Any time I used it, there were never any burns and I even saw it in contrast to another sunblock -- we did a "blue safari" out on a boat and were in the sun a ton and included swimming as well. Over the course of the day, I'd say I applied it three times since we were out so long and in the water and had no issues whatsoever. Protected super well. Unfortunately, the "roll-on" my wife used to do my back only worked once and failed to apply properly after I came in contact with water, leaving my back looking like an abstract sunburn painting. But everywhere I used this stuff, there was not a single inch of burn and you could see exactly where it was used thanks to the excellent protection. Highly recommended.

I have and always will love the smell of "tanning lotion" "sunscreen" call it what you want. This stuff reminds me of what I used as a teenager. I like the idea of the company and so I like Sun Bum. Non greasy, yet hydrating. I got the right amount of sun while smelling like sunshine and vacation!! The bottle is cool and not overdone. Seems like lots of good stuff for my skin. I use the SPF chap stick too, and the after sun lotion. Don't fall for the pricey stuff out there claiming they are worth the extra money. I've been there recently, sucked in to the organic, 50+ SPF, unscented, unwrinkle your wrinkle, make you skinny lies. This is delightful in every thing I want it to be. Buy it.

I cannot speak to those who got fake products, but I ordered this in February and used it a week ago in Costa Rica and I was wowed by the effectiveness of this sunscreen. Granted I reapplied after swimming, but the areas that had SunBum on them did not burn at all. I missed a spot along my arm that did get really red, but thats how I know how well this worked elsewhere. I would say watch your packaging to make sure you are getting the real deal, but this was a terrific product in my book

I have very pale and have sensitive skin...I’m the only one in my family who does not tan. When we go to the beach we like to stay allll day. As long as we put up umbrellas and I have good sunscreen on...I never burn...and I will in a heartbeat if I’m not careful...and my sunburn does not turn to a tan next day like tan people say...I stay burned for days. Yay. In the past I have used Coppertone Water Babies and Neutrogena for babies...the 1st worked but I developed an allergic reaction to it over the years. The 2nd ...also works but bc of all the zinc ...I would look gray instead of just white. Yikes. It was also super hard to wash off...clogging my razor. Sun Bum...I LOVE this product! LOVE IT! It’s easy to apply...not too thick...smells like the sunscreen I think of when I go to the beach AND went on two beach trips this summer and not a hint of pink! And no weird skin reaction! At the beach I am the most careful since we stay out most of the day. I applied it at the beach house with no clothes on so I won’t miss a spot. Get my tan family to do my back...don’t miss feet, back of hands and ears! Haha and I take seriously the wait before getting in the water. I bought the spray to use to reapply later in the day at the beach...we get in and out of the water a lot. So...hope that helps some other fair-skinned beach goer! Note ...I did not use this on my face. I use my Clinique makeup with spf and have for years and I never burn my face and I don’t have to worry about sunscreen hurting my eyes or breaking me out.

My husband is a red head so or course he is super light skinned and always gets burned at the beach. This weekend thanks to Sun Bum he was the only one that didn't get burned except a small part of his legs where we used a different brand thinking he wouldn't need as much there. Everyone else was super impressed with how well this worked. We will never waste money on another brand again. This stuff works and smells amazing!!!

Our family was a huge Ocean Potion fan! So easy to apply, smelled great, went on thick but skin absorption was super fast, reef safe, and it did as advertised, protected us from sun burn! Well, as time passed it became harder and harder to find, so finally - and with an upcoming vacation - I broke down and bought Sun Bum. HOLY COW! Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better, Sun Bum shows up and tells Ocean Potion to hold their beer! This stuff is great! It smells nice but not overwhelming, it rubs on easily but thick, and is absorbed super fast! Also reef safe (very important to us) and provides excellent sun protection. Bye bye OP, hello SB! Our new favorite suncscreen!

Pros: - Seems to work very well - when I reapply properly I haven’t gotten burned! - Broad Spectrum - I like the banana-ish smell - Blends in well with skin - no white cast - Vegan and cruelty-free - Bottle design looks nice - Not drying - hydrating!  Possible cons: - I’ve heard some dermatologists worry about fragrance in sunscreens being irritating. However, this fragrance has not irritated my skin and I’ve recommended this sunscreen to several people. Hasn’t irritated their skin either. If you have sensitive skin though, maybe try applying on a small spot first. - Has Avobenzone for UVA protection, which is good for UVA protection but by itself degrades somewhat quickly over time when exposed to light. However, this sunscreen also has octocrylene, which is supposed to stabilize Avobenzone to some degree. In the USA, we have no rating for UVA protection like we have for UVB protection (SPF). UVB is what causes a sun burn, but UVA can still cause bad skin damage. However, because this sunscreen is labelled as broad spectrum and because it has octocrylene with Avobenzone, it’s probably about as good UVA protection as you’ll get in American chemical sunscreens. Just make sure you reapply if you’re going to be outside a lot! - The bottle’s paint started peeling somewhat after a few months. Not a big deal, but something I noticed.  Overall, I do really like this as a chemical American sunscreen and would recommend it!

Purchased this because i saw online that it was surf friendly and we were headed to Hawaii. Not sure about the surf friendly part but the sunscreen worked well as we did not get a burn while on our trip in Hawaii. We were out all day long and no burns. That is a successful trip. It arrived fast and in great condition. Worked well. No strong odors and easy to spread into your skin. I would recommend this product.

I have a wife and 2 kids, my wife has sensitive skin. My kinds inherited sensitive skin, i can use butter as sunscreen and be fine. They were only able to use a neutrogena sensitive or risk breaking out with these bumps rash looking skin. So i buy this sunscreen for my self. I secretly put it on my son because laziness, from having to go upstairs and get his special sunscreen. I went on very easy, he never broke out. So i secretly put it on my daughter next and low and behold no breaking out. Sunscreen protected very well, 2 to 3 hours of outside TEXAS heat playing, sweat, tears and blood. did not have to reapply. told wife about my test, was punched in chest(abuse!!) but she likes it better than neutrogena having to reapply several times.

My whole family loves this sunscreen so much that I had to by extra bottles for everyone. I love how this smells--like a subtle and nostalgic combo of Sea&Ski and Banana Boat -- not heavy, but very summery. It goes on smoothly, quickly sinking into your skin without any white tint. It makes a wonderful summer moisturizer too! I love that this is mineral based and easy on the environment. If you try it, you'll be stocking up too!

eos-eos

The packaging is really nice. The texture of the bottle is almost rubbery and this comes in handy when you've got a handful of lotion and you're trying not to drop it as you set it down. The yellow cap is easy to use and doesn't open when it's in the bag with a bunch of other swim items. I like the smell, it's subtle and not too overpowering. I am sensitive to intense smells and was glad I didn't have this problem with this brand. The lotion itself is not too thick but creamy enough to spread easily. it doesn't leave a white residue and doesn't feel like I've rolled in grease afterwards. I will definitely buy again!

Amazon is by far the best place to get Sun Bum at. Not only does Amazon sell larger bottles and a wider variety but it is also almost always the best price.  I am in love with this sunscreen, it smells great, goes on easy, is non-greasy, is kind to my skin and covers me for a long time before I have to reapply. This has saved my family, friends and I numerous times. This sunscreen is also Reef-Safe, so it will not contribute to coral bleaching if you're using it while snorkeling (or in the ocean in general).  I am now an avid Sun Bum user and love the Sun Bum Cool Down Hydrating After Sun Lotion with Hydrating Aloe, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin E. Though since switching to this sunscreen I very rarely burn anymore, but I still use the after sun when ever I feel like I got a little too much sun.

I just got back from the Bahamas where I wore this sunscreen constantly! I alternated between the 50 and 30 and applied every 2-3 hours. It completely protected me, I didn’t even get red. The only downside is that it burnt my eyes when I dipped my head underwater but I’d imagine most sunscreens do that.

eos-eos

I bought this to use on myself and kiddos after watching my kids spray passed themself with the sun Bum spray.  The lotion works great. Has a nice smell; coconut pina colada. Less waste.  But like any other lotion it takes a bit more work to cover the same areas as you would with the spray.  As for my family Sun Bum products have been the sunscreen that doesn’t break out my son in a prickly heat rash. And my hubby likes the product even though he doesn’t like the smell of anything coconut he seems to tolerate/ like the smell of Sun Bum.  So we will continue to buy their products.

I like this lotion. Discovered it in Hawaii and brought it home to California. Great absorbing qualities and nice tropical scent.

I try to shop cruelty free/vegan as much as possible. So when browsing the Internet back in February I came across great reviews for Sun Bum products. I ordered the sunscreens and was instantly hooked. We have sensitive skin and my teen daughter is extremely fair. These products are awesome. They are lightweight, go on sheer and don’t have the white shadow film after drying. They don’t irritate our skin either. I wish the scent was stronger but that’s personal preference. When used properly the sun protection is 100% accurate. I can tell the brand is growing in popularity as I have begun to see it in Target as well as a few stores in a recent trip to Myrtle Beach. Try this sunscreen, you won’t be disappointed. The face sunscreens are just as awesome!!

I purchased this for an upcoming cruise because it stated it was Reef friendly and we are going snorkeling and reef friendly sunscreen is required. It arrived in good condition. I have not used this brand of sunscreen before, but I did try a little to make sure I was not sensitive to it. It feels nice on the skin and has a nice soft coconut fragrance which smells good to me. I also like that it is SPF 50 since we have fair skin and tend to burn easy.

I have used Sun Bum products for a few years now, and they never fail to provide amazing protection from the sun. This lotion goes on smooth, spreads easily, and doesn't leave an oily residue on your skin. I use the higher SPF because I am very pale, and burn easily.

eos-eos

I absolutely love this sunscreen!! I am very pale and burn easily, so I have to put a ton on before I go out in the sun. It isnt greasy, or heavy. It goes on smooth and smells amazing!!! It's perfect coverage without feeling like you're wearing any. I love putting it on, even if I'm not going out in the sun because I love the smell of it. You will not be disappointed with this product. I leave one in my purse and in my house so I always have it with me. Its worth the price! I have never been this excited about sunscreen.

This is easily my favorite sunblock ever. I love the scent, the texture, and the protection it provides. I'm tan so I don't need a high SPF, however my husband does since he has fair skin. He loves this product, too.  The SPF15 provides me a nice amount of protection in that I don't feel any part of my skin burning, but I do get a nice tan. Never walked away with a sunburn. My husband loves this because this is one of the few products he can apply and it'll stay put (although I don't think it's waterproof), and he can walk away without burning. The SPF 15 gives him protection but still allows him to tan. Although with the sun getting more intense, or him being out a lot longer, he will move to the SPF 35.  I have to apply this as often as any other sunscreen, but I can say the quality of this if way better than anything else I've used. I haven't used any of the other Sun Bum products, but the sunscreen is definitely a win!

I learned about reef safe sunscreen from a neighbor, she told me of the natural and safe ingredients and piqued my interest. I have been searching for a safe sunscreen without the typical garbage ingredients in them like aluminum that soaks into our skin. This sunscreen is safe and works well for a natural alternative to the other stuff on store shelves.

I was looking for a new vegan 30 or 50 spf sunscreen and I found it. This is my new favourite. My skin is Super sensitive, this does not cause any reaction at all. Great coverage, I have not burned and I burn easily. I took Accutane some years ago and I still have side effects. One of which is my skin is very sensitive and burns easily. It goes on well and absorbs quickly, no white residue. And if I do a regular buffing / scrubbing it applies even smoother and absorbs even better.

eos-eos

Love that this is a great smelling, hardworking sunscreen. It doesn’t feel greasy on and is easy to apply. I feel comfortable using it on both my body and my face (something I won’t do with other sunscreens). That it is vegan and environmentally (reef) friendly is a plus. I like that it protects against UVA and UVB rays. I plan on using this a lot as I typically wear sunscreen year round except when it’s raining.

eos-eos

It’s a light sunscreen that spreads easily, absorbs fast and protects your skin. I buy 50 spf for my face and this for the body. Smells great too.

I love the smell of this lotion! Also it's a little bit thicker than most which I prefer as it actually feels like I'm coated and protected with a nice layer of sunscreen verse the sunscreens out there that have the consistency of water almost. Also love that this brand is vegan and cruelty free and doesn't contain a ton of harmful ingredients. And as a Floridian I'm sopporting a homegrown company when I use Sun Bum! A++

This product is great! I am allergic to aloe and gluten, and do my best to purchase cruelty free and vegan products. There's a faint fragrance of banana and coconut in it (but no actual banana; I'm allergic and I'd get hives if it were), but it's not overpowering at all and goes away fairly quickly. I get migraines from fragrance typically, but not this one. It's also decently hydrating for a sunscreen, and I don't get a white cast like I do with others. I'm very pale, so I can't say for certain if this will be friendly on darker skin tones, but I'm a tentative yes on that. For the quality and price, it's worth trying!

eos-eos

This sunscreen definitely works & has better ingredients than MOST mainstream brands. There are still a few ingredients they could avoid like Fragrance.. however I like that it is easy to rub in unlike mineral sunscreens which I usually use. I applied this on my kids twice when we were swimming & in direct sun for 4 hours straight & they were protected. They did have base tans, but it worked great. We will be taking Sun Bum to the beach since it is reef safe. I’d recommend as an alternative to mainstream companies fir sure.

Pleasant light coconut kind of smell. Leaves my skin quite moisturized. No white cast. Rubs in very well! This stuff was great for my trip to the parks in Orlando. Spent the entire day in the sun, usually reapplied around midday and got no burns! I was sweating the entire day and I was still protected. I am so pale I joke that I might become transparent. No tan for me this trip! I read somewhere that you are supposed to use 1 once of lotion for your whole body to adequately protect you from the sun. So with that in mind, you REALLY need to lather it on (any sunscreen, not just this one!). I was very generous and successfully prevented burns the entire week! Also, keep in mind that expiration dates are VERY important for sunscreen. You need to get a new bottle every year!!!!

I am a pale pale person. I was a longtime user of Neutrogena SPF 100, but I always hated the feel of it - heavy and chalky. It also always let white streaks on my clothes, and as someone who loves to wear black, this was a huge problem. For my trip to Europe, I went on the hunt for a better sunscreen. I spent so much time researching different types, different ingredients, organic vs. nonorganic, different brands. Finally, I settled on SunBum because of the reviews, availability of high SPF, and the reasonable price.  I must say, this product far exceeded my expectations. The texture and feel when I put it on was incredible! It felt like I wasn't even wearing sunscreen. No oily or chalky feel. Honestly, the moisturizing aspect made it feel better than my normal skin. While I was applying it, I wore a black t-shirt and rubbed my arm against it, and NOTHING! No streaks, no white marks, nothing at all. Color me impressed.  Several reviews mentioned the smell. While the smell, when you initially open it, is a stronger coconut scent than I anticipated, it wasn't unpleasant or overwhelming, and I found when I applied it, I really couldn't even smell it or a typical sunscreen smell.  Overall, this is my new go-to for a body sunscreen, and I am so happy to have found it.

eos-eos

The best part of this lotion is that it spreads and goes in really easily. I wanted a lotion that wouldn't make my kids' faces and bodies look bright white. I try to put it on every morning before we leave for the day or before they go to school/daycare and I dont want them to go with white faces. They also hate when I put anything on their face so I only get one or two good swipe attempts to blend it and this goes in really well. This also has a smell, but it is kinda nice and I dont mind it.

Sun Bum is the only sun screen to use. This past year we used the 15 at a resort and wow! No more burning! The stuff works and gives you a golden brown tan without burning. Easy to apply, smells great and leaves your skin silky soft.

This is my favorite sunscreen. It is lightweight and blends into my skin easily. I don't feel greasy after application. This bottle is also big enough to last a while (ie. I used it every day on my week long vacation on my whole body and still had more than half left over). It has a light coconut/tropical smell that is refreshing.  I really like the company, too. This product is reef friendly and is vegan. The company does good in communities, too. For example, they installed shaded areas/canopies in children's playgrounds so they can play during they day without harsh UV rays OR sunscreen. They want to help rpotect people from the sun- regardless if they buy Sun Bum product or not which I respect!!

We’ve used this on vacation for the past two years(new bottles each year) and had excellent results. Hailing from Iowa and working inside, the wifey and I aren’t the most tan. The past two years we have gone on vacation to Playa del Carmen area. Basically wearing swimsuits all day long. Even in the water all day, we haven’t needed to reapply after then initial application. We tend to stick with SPF 30 or 50 depending on the areas covered. We haven’t had any burning, except areas we have missed and the Sun Bum Cool Down working great for that.

I love this sunscreen, and I've tried and tried, to use, but it just Stings the hell out of my eyes. I've tried numerous ways, and none are close to my eyes. At first, it doesn't bother my eyes, and then as time goes on, my eyes start to feel irritated. I don't put this sunscreen no where near my eyes. My eyes water, sting, and just hurt, even after I wash it off. I'm afraid I just can't wear this. Lovely sunscreen, but have to give it up.

This is the best sunblock we've ever used. If you want to be completely protected and not get any tan at all, this product is for you. We would put it on before going outside. Then, we would usually spend close to an hour at in the ocean. Then go to the pool and spend a couple of hours in the pool. Most of the time we didn't re-applied any sunblock and we got obsolutely no tan at all. This is a winner. Once we ran out, we used Banna Boat and we became a little brown towards the end of our trip.
