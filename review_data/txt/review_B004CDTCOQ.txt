Very effective, even in the most intense UV environments.

I bought this sunscreen because we needed it and was a huge mistake. I got rashes all over and after doing my research, found it was recalled in 2021 for cancer causing ingredients! I am so mad it’s being sold on here and it won’t allow me a refund! Buyer beware. I should’ve done extensive research before purchasing this.

I completely missed the size on this some how and paid almost $20 for two 4oz (small) bottles. Good product but ripped off when it came to price.

I ordered this for daughter for a camping trip. When I got the package the sunscreen was broken but the broken piece wasn't in the box. That tells me it was packaged that way. When I tried to return it I was told to contact the manufacturer. All the manufacturer did was give me a 20 % off coupon.

Spent an entire day at the lake on a boat w/o burning. Great product/protection! Only complaint is can fell over and discharged a large amount of product on floor even though the twist lock was still on. Would have given 5 stars otherwise.
