When it comes to sunblocks, Banana Boat is a brand that I can trust and rely on as the best protection against sun for my children. I've used them ever since my children were babies and they never had any problem with it.  One time, I bought a cheap, genetic CVS brand instead to save money and learned the lesson the hard way because it stung my children's eyes so badly that they couldn't use it. Ever since then, I never even looked at any other brand other than Banana Boat.  They are a bit pricey compared to other brands but then you get what you pay for and you are paying for the quality. Don't compromise your children's safety and comfort for couple of dollars in savings.  I now buy them during the winter when the prices come down since I know I will need them in the summer. So shop around for the best price and stock them up when you find them in lower price, especially during the off season if you know you will be spending time at the pool or beach in upcoming summer.  This particular is 100 SPF, which is great but it doesn't indicate "tear + sting free" label so I would only use them in the body and not on the face. I recommend to purchase the Banana Boat Kids spray separately for the face protection. Hope this was useful... and if it was, please click on the helpful button below. Thank you!

My husband and I both burn easily, he HATES lotion sunscreen, and we go to the NC Outer Banks every year on vacation. This is the ONLY sunscreen I have ever found that goes on easily, starts protecting pretty much immediately (seriously, you can pretty much spray this on and go directly in the water with no issue), doesn't rub off on clothes, and keeps my super fair husband and my super fair self from burning *at all*.  We use this all the time for hikes, biking, pretty much any time we're going to be out in the sun, and it's GREAT! Absolutely worth the price.

We recently spent a month in Hawaii. We usually use Coppertone Sport SPF 30 or 50. However, Hawaii is prohibiting the sale and use of products that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate which are ingredients that damage reefs. Titanium Dioxide and mineral oil are also to be avoided since they can harm sea life. So we needed to find a new sunscreen that is reef friendly.  Background: I don't tan. I come from a long line of people who spontaneously combust. I therefore make sure I am wearing a good sunscreen and a hat when outdoors. I liked the Coppertone Sport product and was concerned that: a new sunscreen with a different formula would work as well; would spread well; and didn't stink. I don't want to smell of bananas or coconut oil.  We tried the Banana Boat Ultra Sport Sunscreen Lotion, Broad Spectum SPF 30, and were very impressed. - The lotion went on easily. It's not greasy or globby. It smooths in easily. - The lotion does not smell. - With normal precautions, we didn't burn (or even turn red).  (Note: We did not try the spray version. I hate sprays as you end up with uneven coverage and you know some of that spray is going to end up on things such as your clothes, car, floors, eyes, hair, or furniture. It's also a poor value compared to the lotion).  While your results may vary, we were very happy with this sunscreen lotion.

This has been my go-to sunscreen for years! My husband and I both have fair skin and tend to burn easily...but not with this sunscreen. The formula is thick and creamy and provides great protection from the sun! Unlike a lot of sunscreens, this one doesn’t smell or leave me feeling sticky or greasy. We used this sunscreen during a recent vacation to Thailand where it was 90+ degrees and we were outside all day long. Instead of returning home with a painful sunburn, we both had glowing, tan skin. I can’t recommend this sunscreen enough!

My wife has very fair skin (she burns within an hour of sun exposure), which makes it difficult for her to do many outdoor activities during the summer like going to the lake or even yard work. When she wears this sunscreen on her arms, legs and neck she gets the protection she needs. Application is easy, just spray. She rubs it all over to make sure it covers everything evenly. This worked great when we went to the lake and were in and out of the water all day. she just reapplied it every few hours.

When reviewing this product. It ask you to put a STAR for:  Sun protection Water resistance  I put 5 stars because, how would i know? I don't use it to go into water and you'd need to be a scientist testing how good the sun protection is. I just assume it works.  But i've used banana boat sunblock in the past. And it's been fine. No sunburns. As long as you remember to re-apply it because it's not meant to last all day.  Pros:  - It's sunblock  - It works (from my previous experience)  - New bottle design.  They changed the style of the bottle. The new bottle has the date on it. The old bottles only had a serial number. In order to find out if your old bottles are expired you had to go to the banana boat website and see the instructions on how to read the serial # that way you can know the expiration date.  The new bottle is more simple, the date is laid out easy to read on the bottle.  - Long expiration date: I bought this sunblock around april or may of 2020 and the bottle says it will expire January 01, 2022  - Nice slim bottle to fit into a small bag.  Cons:  - It's a small 8 FL OZ bottle. My old bottle is a 10 FL OZ. Not sure if they still sell the 10FL OZ.  - It feels a little heavy and thick on the skin. But after a while it's fine.  - If you rub your hands / fingers around your eye, especially if you're sweaty. You might get the sunblock into your eyes. That has happened to me on hot summer days. It will make you teary eyed and irritate your eyes for a long while.  - I hear this sunblock may stain clothes. So far that has not happened to me.

I really like this product. I am fair skinned, live in FL and play lots of tennis! This 100 spf is thicker and it prevents me from getting burned beautifully! I know experts state that over 50 spf is useless, but I disagree! 50 spf has caused me to burn badly, this really works!

We used this SPF 100 sunscreen in Disneyland. We sprayed it on once in the morning before we went to the park. After that we didn't spray again that day. It lasted the entire day and nobody got burned. With the exception of a few localized locations which didn't get good coverage nobody really even tanned, so well done.  I only wish the spray were more directed, it sprays so far, that one can only lasted 2 or 3 days for 8 people. Most of the spray was vaporized and fell to the ground. So if the spray were more directed, it would be a full 5 star. But since I can't give a 4 1/2 rating (which is what I would do because of the spray itself) I give it 5 stars.

I had melanoma a few years back and so I always purchase the maximum sunscreen I can find. I love Banana Boat Sport sunscreen spray for two reasons: 1. It is so easy to spray on and applies literally in seconds without having to worry about missing any spots like I do with lotion.  2. It really does last through several hours of sweating, swimming, etc. Even in ocean water. I used it daily for two straight weeks at the beach this summer and did not get a burn at all!  I recommend reapplying every couple of hours. This product works incredibly well if you use it regularly. Be aware that this product will still allow you to develop a slight tan if you have very very pale skin like I do, but it will be minimal and you definitely won't have any burns!

Using a spray like this is a fast and easy way to spread sunscreen on you in a hurry. I am a runner and use this for the majority of my exposed skin before almost any run. I use a cream for my face and this spray for everything else. You have to be careful not to let overspray hit the nearby floor or anything else, and you need to spread it around by hand, but it does not get any faster or easier than this product.

eos-eos

I liked this sunscreen so much. I ordered a supply so that I wouldn’t run out and now I am stuck with several spray cans I won’t be able to use. Soon after I got the product there were warnings against using it. I like the 100 for I have had melanoma and need to use strong sunscreen. This one does not irritate my eyes and I have never gotten a sunburn when I use it. It doesn’t have a strong scent which I think is a good thing.

Having recently moved to Las Vegas, I was looking for some awesome sunscreen to protect my pale skin. I moved from Long Island, so I was no stranger to putting on sunscreen when going to the beach, but frequently it was whatever I have lying around my house, or whatever a friend happen to bring.  Having had way too many memories of those types of sunscreens where you constantly ask the person next to you if they can still see white, I turned to Amazon to see if I could find something affordable with great reviews.  Well this sunscreen fit the bill, and I've always liked banana boat so I figured what the heck.  I love this sunscreen. Seriously, it is the best sunscreen I've ever had. I regularly put it on at the pool, and every time I turn to my girlfriend and ask her if there's white crap all over my face, she says no! I say, no there must be... I just put sunscreen on and I have beard stubble, it must be caught in there right? Nope.  Even better, it never comes off while in the pool, and I have yet to get it in my eyes as a result of that.  I don't have very high hopes for sunscreen in general, but darn this is some fine sunscreen.

eos-eos

I live at the edge of the desert and am pretty pale so light sun protection won't do. It is not the fastest absorbing sunscreen I've ever used but you need very little to keep you protected. Even after hours of yard work and intense sweating the protection has never 'washed off' my forehead or neck. I haven't had a sunburn since using this. The scent isn't particularly strong either and fades very quickly after applying.

eos-eos

The aerosole puts out a very fine mist so that you get good coverage without using too much. Also, it doesn't have a big initial burst of pressure when you first push the button so that controlling coverage is easier. So even though you are paying a premium for this product it's really worth the money because of the design. My skin needs all the protection it can get and this has been the best in my experience. I never get burned

Unfortunately, I ruined family vacation a few years ago by absolutely scorching myself on day one at the beach. Since then, I have been using Banana Boat SPF 100 to avoid sunburns and ensure max sun enjoyment. Highly recommend if you are fair or tattooed! Not to mention, it is a spray so it makes for easy applications!

eos-eos

What I like about this product is that I use it mainly on my face. I spray my fingertips and rub it on. Same even on my ears. Spray onto my fingers and rub it on. It dries in a minute or two and lasts all day if you don't go in the water. I have very white skin and I'm susceptible to skin cancer, but have not had a problem at all becoming sunburned wearing this product. Some experts say that 50 spf is all you need but with my sensitive skin I go with full 100 anyway. Never burned wearing it. I hate lotions!

eos-eos

This stuff works. I get burned after being outside a while and I turn into a human lobster. But this stuff really works. I use only SPF 100 (hard to find at times) and I just re-ordered these three cans and am most happy. I can sit out on the deck for hours after spraying one coat and I have no sunburn to speak of. Recommended product.

Took this out to the Nevada/Arizona sun and it worked perfectly! No burns. Perfect.

I like to use the Banana Boat spray on sunscreen for convenience, but like to apply rub in sunscreen to my face and more exposed areas. In the past I have had problems with sunscreen running into my eyes to the point that it often kept me from using it anywhere near my eyes. I applied this liberally over my face on a very hot day at the beach and had no problems with sunscreen causing my eyes to tear. I trust the Banana Boat name to protect me from the sun and expect waterproof claims to be accurate, so my main concern is how the sunscreen absorbs and if it runs into my eyes. This product absorbs well, does not leave greasy residue, and does not run into your eyes. Also the container itself is great. Its hard plastic and seemingly very leak-proof. Best sunscreen I have used...

eos-eos

I use this when I go somewhere where the sun is strong, I love it cause I can spray hard to reach areas and because I can use it in my scalp which has a tendency to burn. It’s really useful!!

I used to use spray-on sunscreen but they can be really oily & messy. This sunscreen is not greasy & doesn't have a heavy odor. I kayak a lot in the summer so I need something "sweat resistant & water resistant"; this is both. I reapply if I go underwater but I've been lazy & not reapplied & it still worked (I wouldn't recommend being lazy that way!). It doesn't make your skin feel like it's encased in a slimy bag. Of course the most important thing, it blocks UVA/UVB rays & keeps me from getting sunburned!  I've used sunscreen that doesn't wash out of my clothes - yuck. This one doesn't seem to leave a lot of odor after going through the wash; there may be a hint of its scent but not so strong that I need separate clothes for wearing sunscreen. It probably helps that it's not really oily & absorbs in to the skin.

eos-eos

Make sure you do this outdoors and away from other people. There is a strong order when you first are spraying and applying. It left me feeling very greasy, more than other sunblocks. But it did protect me from the Sun.

I bought this for my July 2019 vegas trip after peeling like a baby boa from my 2019 May trip to Vegas with only spf 50. I am happy to say after 13 hrs walking in almost constant 103 temperature I still have all my layers of skin! My 11 yr old mini me was also burn free. Easy to apply, not super strong smell, fast dry, reapplied only as recommended

I buy this for vacation. I would rather not tan on vacation than spend my entire vacation burned and not being able to enjoy myself. It works great and it's tacky feeling. This is my 2nd year using spf 100 and I love it.

Bought this for my two small kids. We live in eastern WA where it frequently gets up to 100 degrees in the summer with lots of direct sunlight and never had any issues with sunburns or skin irritation. We spend a lot of time in the water (pools, rivers lakes) and even after hours splashing in the water this sunscreen has been effective. As a spray, this is very easy to apply to impatient children.

The product was not sent to match the description. I ordered a two pack for 18$ not one for that price. This product is amazing but if it can’t be filled to order the way it’s advertised then I don’t want it! I’ll go to Walgreens. Not once but twice !

Love this sunscreen! My kids and I have very white skin. I tend to burn easily. We used this when we went to Disneyland and spent all day in the heat in August. Not even a hint of sunburn. VERY easy to apply. SOOO much better than the lotion for applying. Will DEFINATELY use/buy again.

I'm a ginger and hiding from the great fusion reactor in the sky is a life long task. I'm so fair skinned that I can get sun burnt walking from the parking lot to the store. I've tried multiple brands and formula in my life but for some reason the only long lasting water resistant type has been Banana boat. I apply it on my ears, nose and neck at 4 am and work all day outside, no burns. This is with sweat and sometimes rain.  No complaints and I highly recommend if you are fair skinned and work outside.

Banana boat got it right. Finally, Finally a lightweight breathable sunscreen, that actually looks good, feels good, not greasy, love it.

I randomly got this sunscreen a long time ago and liked it, not really paying attention to it. But recently I needed a new bottle, and after reading reviews for a dozen other sunscreens, I stuck with this one. Having read so many reviews, I started taking notice of all the good qualities of this particular product: less viscous, less oily, dries well, smells good, doesn't stain clothes. I had no idea that so many (especially spray on) sunscreens stain clothes - what kind of idiot came up with that? Well, this one didn't, so, with everything else, it remains my top choice.

eos-eos

I have been using it for years, and it always works well for me. I do reapply it often, and pay special attention to my nose, shoulders, top of my chest and top of my feet. I reapply after getting out of the water.

I have been using this for 20 years as an endurance cyclist and have yet to find a better sun protection lotion. The lack of scent is important to me. Stands up well to Florida sun. Great product.

Eventually, perspiration will wick the sunscreen to your eyes, and stinging may occur. For some reason, Banana Boat sunscreen does not wick as readily to your eyes as the other brands. And if it does get to your eyes, Banana Boat doesn't sting as badly. Just use water and soap to wash your face, and just water around your eyes to wash the sunscreen off, and you're good to go.

Our vacation was in Mexico for 7 days and we family didn't get tan even a bit, this is the first time we are back super fair in original colour. This is the best Sunscreen I ever used in my life for the temperature 80+ Ferenhite. Usually we come back in burnt patched skin but this time this saved us!

Stays on and lasts. Also doesn't run and burn your eyes like Coppertone Sport. Good brand. Highly recommend

We bought this to take with us to Disney since me and my girls are all incredibly pale. 3 days walking around the park at the end of June in summer with the full sun and temps around 100 and none of us got sunburnt. We reapplied every 1.5-2 hours and one bottle was enough for the entire trip. It sprayed evenly and dried quickly with no greasy residue.

I can't find the 100 proof anywhere but here. These are my go to sunscreen for my whole family. A little expensive for small bottles but worth the buy.

I made sure to buy two of these before heading to Jamaica for a week. I only applied it once per day (all over my body and my face), while being out in the sun, and swimming in sea and pool all day. I did not get anything remotely close to a sunburn. I got slightly slightly tan. My friends and coworkers were asking why I only got a such light tan. I have this sunscreen to thank.

eos-eos

I was a missionary for two years under the hot relentless Mexican sun. I'm one of those people that could not get a tan even if I wanted to. I just burn like a toasted cheeser. This sunscreen worked wonders for me while I walked out in the sun almost all day, everyday for two years. It never gave me skin troubles, and the only sunburns, even minor, that I ever got were on days that I thought would be cloudy, but turned out to be very VERY sunny.

I use this on the whole family (including myself). It is quick and easy to apply; provides good, long-lasting protection, and has proven to be gentle on my family's skin. My kids both have sensitive skin and this has never irritated their skin. It is our go to.

I picked this up for my trip to Costa Rica. I had left my last bottle behind when I lived in Hawaii, and knew it worked great when I would go to the beach there as well. I only used it once while in Costa Rica (rainy season) and it worked well. When I used it in Hawaii, this was my go to. It is super important to apply the sunscreen about 30 minutes before sun exposure in order to ensure it's efficacy. When I used this, I never had an issue with sunburns, as long as I reapplied as well. It's tough knowing that sunscreen is bleaching our coral reefs, but I guess I would rather protect myself against skin cancer. I would without a doubt recommend this to others, obviously with taking into consideration SPF level with skin complexion and climate you're going to use it in.

I'm an Irish Redhead with 2 skin colors...highly reflective white and lobster red. This is my go to sunscreen for my cruises and vacations. On my last cruise I overheard another very pale young woman talking about she left her sunscreen on the ship, so I offered her to use mine. We were in The Bahamas, several hours later I ran into her again and she was so thankful because she was not burnt. It's a little thick, but just keep rubbing it in and coverage is awesome! Highly recommend
