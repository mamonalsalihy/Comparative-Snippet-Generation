Love this spf. Ive bought 3 bottles. Its light weight and moisturuzing, but not too much for my oily skin. It doesnt break me out or cause texture. The tint is fine on my light skin. No orange color. It has the coverage of a tinted moisturizer. Love it!

I absolutely love this sunscreen!! It’s smooth and looks great under makeup or alone. Would have given it 5 stars except its too dark for my fair skin. Exchanging for no tint.

So hard to find a face sunblock that does not dry out your skin. This Elta MD Elements is great! ...and is water resistant (for a short time - you should reaply any time you are jumping into water just like with any sunblock) The tint is a little dark for me. I've combined this with the Paula's Choice face sunblock for a perfect color match - for me. ... as suggested by Angie on the youtube channel Hot and Flashy. Most face sunblocks I use make my eyes cry - even though I never applied it near my eyes. My cheeckbones is as far as I get when applying sunblock. With both of these two products I can get right around the eye with no irritation!

This is the first sunscreen I ever tried that felt wonderful, this is luxury skincare. I would recommend it for any skin type from dry to oily, and to people with sensitive skin. It feels hydrating, not greasy. It applies nicely and leaves no white cast, even though it's mineral based. Only the very darkest and very palest skin colors might feel like the tint isn't a perfect match, but most will find it invisible. The finish is a healthy looking satin. The UVA and UVB protection are top of the line. Highly recommend.

Honestly, I really like the product itself. I am always trying different sunscreens, particularly for my face. This is up there with the best of them. It is, however, ridiculously expensive at $17/ounce. Ouch! The packaging is not good. Why did Elta MD put this product in a pump-type dispenser instead of a standard tube? This thing spits product. It's on my mirror, the sink, my clothes. Every little spit is money down the drain. So, as much as I like the product itself, I won't repurchase unless the packaging changes.

This is definitely not a moisturizer, and the tint is slightly too dark to wear alone on my fair skin (Mac NC 15). But it is a very good sunscreen. Wears surprising well under makeup, especially for a mineral sunscreen. This is the choice for those with sensitive skin who need a reliable mineral sunscreen and wear makeup. If I was a tad darker I’d definitely wear this by itself as the tint does even out skin tone enough for a no makeup look day. Highly recommend.

My holy grail so far! ordered the physical spf 41 and returned them due to the dryness and the tint is too light for me. This elements one work great? it absorbs and dries down fast, leaving nice glow and not giving white cast. I'm Asian with medium skin tone. However the tube is terribly designed and it's hard to get sunscreen out without making a mess. On the 2nd day the tube is broken!!!!!!!!!!!! SO CHANGE THAT PLS just make it a simple package like the spf 41 and reduce the price since the ingredients is slightly different from the spf 41 but more expensive which i think because of the nice looking tube??? :D no one neeeds a fancy bottle which doesnt even fuction well!

I am a sunscreen freak, but also a girl who likes a tinted moisturizer. I wore this everyday on a 6 day camping trip at Lake Shasta! I came back with zero burn! I also wore a hat of course but I think it helped with the lakes reflection. I have olive skin and you couldn’t tell I was wearing a tinted sunscreen at all. I put some on under my eyes to help with the dark circles (come on ladies, you know with kids and camping isn’t much of a “vacation”) and it helped. The only thing with that is that it would crease but nothing that a little dab couldn’t fix. Anyway, if you are into moisturizer, some tint and spf then this is your go to. I’m definitely keeping this as my face sunscreen!

Hands down the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. So moisturizing. I am a collector of tinted sunscreens and I always come back to this one. It provides just enough coverage to make it look like I’m wearing no makeup, yet covers small imperfections in the skin. This pic is no makeup. Only the sunscreen

I am obsessed with this product. I have tried a few elta MD sunscreens as well as many brands of face sunscreens. What I love most about this product is how it smooths my skin when I wear it. It makes my skin look like I have just a little bit of beautiful tinted moisturizer on. I went to a wedding once and forgot my make up and used this sunscreen and it worked perfectly! What I love most is how water resistant it is. I work out in this all the time and ride my bike and go to brunch and I feel like my face still looks smooth and is protected. I also try to keep my face out of the sun and this product makes my face look as tan as my body which I love. I am scraping what’s left out of my current bottle and ordering my second one now !

LOVE THIS! 1) All you need for your face in one! 2) NATURAL subtle looking coverage and glow I just use with a little bit of bronzer

I have been using this Elta MD UV Elements sunscreen for several years now and have never found a better product (although I am always open to try a new mineral sunscreen). Most mineral sunscreens leave a detectable white cast on my Fitzpatrick III skin, but this one does not. When I am in very bright light, the tone can appear very slightly orange, but I can correct this with a slightly lighter foundation layered over it. Most days I skip the foundation and just wear this sunscreen, as it provides some coverage and a smooth finish. It does stain my white shirts, so I only apply it to my face, and I use an Aveeno mineral sunscreen for my neck. I haven't had any trouble with breakouts or dryness (and my skin does run dry). This sunscreen plays well with whatever skin care I like to apply beneath it, and has not pilled. I do give my moisturizer and sunscreen a few minutes to dry down before applying any makeup.  The tube delivery system is my only complaint, but I have learned to work around it. Eventually, the tube quits pumping, although there is plenty of product inside. I then tap the tube on a counter to get the contents to the opposite end of the pump, unscrew the pump, squeeze the tube to expel as much air as I can, and then reapply the pump to the compressed tube. Even so, there is usually quite a bit of product left in the bottle when those maneuvers cease to work, so that's when I use my handy cosmetic spatula. Overall, I am very pleased with this sunscreen. I would love to see this offered with more tint options and a plain tube delivery system without the pump.

I have tried many tinted sunscreens, and finally found my ULTIMATE in this. Every one I tried either pilled over my moisturizer or made my face look even older and drier. I now use the Australian Gold tinted SPF 50 on my neck, chest and ears, and this tinted EltaMD UV Elements SPF 44 on my face. It works so well with my new Ultimate foundation, the Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra Rescue, which also has SPF 45. My face looks radiant - Not Shiny!! - and youthful. I'm nearly 63, so that is definitely what I needed. I tried the Australian Gold tinted on my face, but it was so drying that it accentuated my wrinkles. I've used this EltaMD tinted SPF 44 for a couple of days now, and couldn't be happier. I now have that "lit from within glow" that people talk about. I did try another EltaMD formula with SPF 41 prior to this, and don't be confused - it pilled horribly with my moisturizer and foundation. I recommend this Elta MD tinted SPF 44 product highly. I hope they never change it - and that EL never changes the Futurist Hydra Rescue foundation - best combo ever! I am a strawberry blonde, fair with neutral to pinky undertones, blue eyes, and this tinted sunscreen works great for me, as does the Futurist shade 2C3 Fresco. Good luck to all in your search for your perfect SPF / foundation combo!

My favorite of the elta sunscreens. I love the tint color. It’s sheer. Elta was recommended by my derm and I’ve used it for years. I’ve even purchased as gifts. If in doubt on which elta is ideal for you, go to their website and read all the descriptions. Some have no tint, some have more zinc, some are water resistant. Some are better for acne prone, etc. Elements tinted is my favorite and I’ve used it for years.

This was recommended to me by a medspa esthetician, and I’m very happy with it. Just a hint of color that doesn’t interfere with foundation or can be worn alone. It does protect frontman everyday exposure though I wouldn’t use it for extensive outdoor activity like the beach. Very smooth and it does moisturize well.

eos-eos

I love this product, second time ordering. This product doesn’t settle into wrinkles & fine lines, that’s my favorite part. It stays on all day and doesn’t ever look blotchy. The pictures are right after applying. I use concealer too under my eyes and then my skin is done! I recommend this product to everyone and will never go back to regular foundation. If you’re wondering if you should try this product, definitely do!!!

I am 50+ with sun-damaged skin from my youth which I am currently trying to correct with prescription retinoids and a good skin-care regimen. Why bother with all that if I am not going to prevent future damage with sunscreen? This is an excellent mineral sunscreen that doesn't irritate my skin. It's a bit pricey, but I add a pea-sized dab of Australian Gold tinted facial sunscreen (which alone can be a bit drying), to two pumps daily and this lasts about 6 weeks. Depending on the humidity, this can be a little shiny which I need to correct with translucent powder. Overall, this is the best mineral tinted sunscreen out there, and I never want to be without it. Def recommend!

I first heard of this brand though Hot and Flashy YouTuber. She swears by this bb cream. I’ve been a faithful bb cream user of the maybe brand. It was hard to let go. But I did and I’m glad. There was nothing wrong with the other brand. But this one has a higher spf. The color is a bit more darker than my skin color. The YouTuber mixes this bb cream with another brand bb cream so I’m considering the same with my other fave. It goes on smoothly and my make up goes on even better. I wear it alone at home or under make up when i go to work. I have not experienced issues with the packaging like others said they did.  Update: I just experienced issues with the packaging. It no longer dispenses. I have to open it to get the product out. Still worth it though and will continue purchasing.

My dermatologist put me on to this product. I love the light coverage it offers in terms of evening my skin tone without looking like I am wearing any makeup. It dries smooth and a natural matte finish, not at all thick, shiny, or greasy. I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any type of skin reaction. I am outside for a good portion of the day and I have never gotten sunburned while using this. I am not doing heavy exertion and getting sweaty so I don't know how well it holds up to that.

eos-eos

Update: I ended up not liking this. By the afternoon, this started oxidizing on my face and I looked like an oompa loompa and I think I may have gotten sunburn too....the hunt for a good tinted sunscreen continues.  Initial Review: So far I like this tinted spf. I do have over 40 combination skin so I'm not trying to look super matte nor do I want to look super glowy. Keep in mind it is mineral so it's going to be slightly heavier than a chemical based spf. It will not really completely disappear into your skin but it will offer you better protection than chemical spf. I am medium to tan Asian skin and the tint is ok, pulls slightly more pinkish orange but blends in. It's not meant to be foundation so if that is what you are looking for, this is not it. It will help even out your skin tone very slightly. after having it on for a little while, it does feel sticky on my face so I will need to powder it. It's a good alternative for the no make up days. For those of you having issues with the product coming out of the pump, it's because there is no straw on the pump so it relies on the product being at the top of the tube where the pump is. The problem with this is that they manufactured it with air in the tube. What I did to solve the issue is to open the tube, turn it on the bottom of the tube and lightly tap it on the table to get all the air to come to the top. Then squeeze the tube very gently until the product comes close to the opening but leave enough room to reinsert the pump. Do not let go, you want to make sure the air stays out of the tube until you get the pump back on tightly. Once the pump is on tightly, the tube should be air tight and now there will no more air pockets to keep the pump from working properly. As you pump more product, the tube should get flatter and flatter. Just like with any other product with a pump, you will never be able to get all the product out when you get close to empty. At that point you will just need to open the tube and get it out like a regular squeeze tube.

eos-eos

This is a beautiful made and easy to use product! I hesitated buying it initially as I thought it was expensive for the size of bottle but the pump dispenser works well and two pumps gives me enough good coverage for my entire face and neck. It’s also not drying but at the same time it is not gloopy or sticky either, it moisturizes beautifully and is comfortable to wear all day either on its own or under makeup, in fact I use it instead of foundation as I don’t like how foundation seems to sit in my laughter lines, this product doesn’t do that to me! As it’s tinted I was also worried but it works well for me and I think in fact it will for a lot of skin shades. This will be my go-to from here on!

After having two basal cell carcinomas removed from my nose, my surgeon warned me to always wear sunblock, at least 40 SPF. I hate the feeling of sunblock, even the really good ones, and prefer to wear a hat. But my sister-in-law showed me this product and after trying it on, I was sold. It goes on like moisturizer, but is like wearing a light foundation. You can't tell I'm wearing it, except I don't get sunburned. And no matter your skin tone, it provides no-show coverage, and even covers small imperfections and redness. It's a miracle!

I'd been using another mineral based brand for years with a 30 SPF. I wanted to up the spf but stay with a mineral based product. The brand I was using did not offer that. I'd seen this product reviewed on my favorite YT beauty channel. So far incredibly happy. For me (with sensitive, combo skin, leaning toward dry) it's a dual duty moisturizer/sun screen. And yet, not at all greasy as long as you let it 'set' for a few minutes before applying other products. The tint is right on for my medium toned skin. So far as giving better sun protection, time will tell.

eos-eos

Love this product! I have tried all kinds of sunscreens. Even the most gentle cause my face to break out. My dermatologist suggested a brand they sell and It was super expensive! Amazon to the rescue! I chose this based on reviews and it absolutely did not disappoint. It keeps my face perfectly protected even after spending all day at the lake. I have had no issues with the brown spots I usually fight all summer. I’ve also had no breakouts. I use this every day as my makeup. It covers well but I still use concealer around my eyes. Otherwise it’s perfect. I’ve never had a sunscreen I didn’t freak wearing under makeup but now I have the best of both - makeup and sunscreen all in one. I am on my second tube and waited to review until I could say whether it really worked.

eos-eos

If you want a great sunscreen go with Elta MD. I have tried many of their products and none of them have disappointed me. I am really enjoying the elements one. I have dry skin and it goes on great and feels good too. Totally worth the price. Best anti aging product you can wear is sunscreen. I wear it everyday even if I am just in the house. I also use the Eucerin hydration cream with spf 30 daily for my neck, arms, legs and chest.

I've been using this sunscreen for years and it's my absolute favorite! I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea and this causes absolutely no irritation. I do find that applying my daily moisturizer first does help as this is a water resistant sunscreen and doesn't actually moisturize dry skin, however I believe if your skin is normal to oily it would be good alone. My skin tone is light to med with neutral/warm undertones.

eos-eos

I was leery of a tinted sunscreen (esp. one that just came in like 2 colors), but this stuff is fantastic. The color is super sheer-just enough to even your skin a tiny bit, but not anything like a full/med coverage foundation. I still use concealer in problem areas, but for most of my face, this is just enough. The best part is that it’s really gentle on my SUPER sensitive skin. I have mild rosacea and break out really easily, and this didn’t react at *all* with my skin. It feels super hydrating, not greasy, and even though it’s not a chemical sunscreen, it doesn’t feel like it sits on top of your skin. 10/10

I recently had a horrible acne outbreak in my 40s and it was mortifying. I went to the dermatologist, and she recommended this sunscreen. I will never go back. I have worn a moisturizer/sunscreen every day since my teens, and I never knew my skin could be so matte. I have always had oily skin that was very sensitive, and all the drug store combo products I used made my face slick. I suffered through for years, then I found this. I wouldn’t recommend this as a moisturizer, i need to use a moisturizer underneath. But OMG, what a difference in my skin after this product, and the SPF works great for so long. I tell everyone. Worth every penny.

eos-eos

I love this stuff! Especially in the era of COVID when wearing a full face of foundation is practically pointless - this tinted moisturizer gives me the confidence to not wear any other products! The SPF has worked great and the coverage is surprisingly good - but never looks smeared around my face. It’s made my daily routine so much easier & improved my appearance while just hanging around the house!  I will say that the first week of wearing it I noticed some little breakouts. I was afraid I was going to have to give up the product, but since it wasn’t cheap I persevered and now my skin has no reaction to it.

eos-eos

This applies easily and looks great on my skin, I'd say it's a medium coverage. I don't know how one would tell if the sunblock works or not because I haven't been out in the Sun for any amount of time lately. I can't say I've noticed a scent either so if it has one it must be subtle. It's a great solution for combining sun block and foundation. I'll definately buy it again.

I was on the hunt for a moisturizing tinted sunscreen that would wear great with makeup and didn't come in a teeny tiny bottle. I received this yesterday and wore it today. I didn't even put foundation on after I applied it because I loved the way the tint made my skin look! I Can not say how moisturizing it is just yet because it's my first day but so far im obsessed!

If you’re debating whether or not to spend the money don’t debate any longer! Such a nice sunscreen. Helps even skin tone which I love. Wears well with or without makeup. In the winter I mix this with the Paula’s choice tinted sunscreen as it can be a tad dark on very fair skin. I’ve tried many different facial sunscreens and this by far is my go to fave!! Light and moisturizing but not heavy or greasy. Easy to dispense and glides over skin easily. Non comedogenic and water resistant for up to 40 min. Received compliments on my skin since using this product and nothing else has changed in skincare routine. Overall, a perfect choice even though a bit spendy.

I’ve tried over 10 mineral SPFs in the last 3 years and this one is still my favorite so far. I’ve purchased 7 times. Ever since I started using tretinoin I became obsessed with sun protection and mineral sunscreens are my favorite. This one is light but moisturizing, color is perfect on me, goes well under make up, and is covered by my HSA. I recommend it 100%

I hate when you put moisturizer on and you feel it for extended periods of time. This does NOT feel that way. Absorbs right in. Love the 44 spf. Recently had basil cell removed so I’m extra careful and this helps me to relieve the worry. Dermatologist recommend it, even if your indoors, the lighting also gives off uv rays. Just reordered recently.

I live in Hawaii and this is a must have if you are outside a lot and don't want skin cancer or have the sun suck the life out of your skin. It goes on smoothly and definitely get this tinted one because the plain one makes you look like a ghost. It doesn't irritate my skin at all and it doesn't make me break out in a sweat like SPF sun screens. It also gives your face a smooth texture similar to foundation.

I really like this sunscreen. It has not caused my skin to breakout. A definite plus is that there isn’t a white cast to my face. The product is tinted when it comes out of the bottle. I don’t notice immediate color when applying to my face, but I can see a small amount of color after 5 to 10 minutes. I typically wear “light” colored foundation, and I do not notice any shade difference between my face and neck after applying this product.

Other go on too shiny, or so thick you look like Zuckerberg at the beach. Both of those also have stained so many clothes.

Very moisturizing and it is nice that it has a high SPF and zinc—which has more SPG staying power. It also has hyaluronic acid which prevents it from drying out. The drawback is it is very very sheer coverage. I sometimes add foundation to it to provide more coverage.

I love this sunscreen! It works with the color of my skin perfectly. I dont like thick foundations so the amount of tint in this is perfect for what I want. Covers some of my super red cheeks but let's through just enough to not have to use blush. Not as moisturizering but that is what the moisturizer is for.

This stuff is great. My dermatologist recommended it when I was on acutane and I just never stopped using it. It’s tinted which is great because it doesn’t make you’re face white like a lot of sunscreen does. Very lightweight, not like the heavy greasy stuff.

So far so good! I have yellow tone to olive skin color and this looks good on me. My only issue is that it absorbs into the skin so fast that you have to work in the product quickly. It does not leave a shiny finish. The scent is not that great but is tolerable and goes away quickly. Since using this I noticed less breakout and more even skin tone

Love the tint. Helps even out my complexion. Favorite part is that it is hydrating. Being in my 50’s I need hydration and a lot of mineral face sunblocks are very drying. Works great under makeup. I think I found my holy grail facial sunscreen!

The sunscreen was very lightweight. I wore it before going out in 90 degree weather and even went skating and it held up great with some concealer. Coverage is obviously sheer since it is just a tint, but it was enough for me since right now I do not need too much coverage. I reapplied two hours after and it did not look weird or caked up in any way. Recommend 100%

Love it! Lives up to the hype. Better than foundation. If it’s too dark, just add a bit of regular sunscreen or a drop Dermablend Flawless Creator paler shade. If it’s too pale, just add a drop of Dermablend Flawless Creator In darker shade. Great texture. Then use a little coverup where needed. OR, easy to wear under your foundation.

I split my time between Ohio and Florida and the constant change in environment can affect my skin. This is the best tinted moisturizer that I have ever used. It hydrates my skin, adds a sunscreen barrier, and evens out my skin tone. I often skip the foundation and just wear this on days that I am doing outdoor activities.
