Bought this because it wasn’t supposed to cuss breakouts. It made me breakout

It feels like a well made product… fine formula .. I highly recommend it!!

I have very sensitive skin and am a melanoma survivor. I use this when I expect to be spending time in the sun.. here in South Florida, that translates to all of the time! It feels great on, lightweight, never itchy, doesn’t dry my face out, and it provides excellent protection! My dermatologist had given me a sample to try and now I swear by it!!!! Protect your skin!

If you have skin problems this product is not for your face, I got huge break outs from it. Also I don’t like how it affects my eyes when I sweat, I cannot open my eyes. It’s not better product as others

This feels amazing to put on the face, definitely looks shiny at first but I’ve worn it under a face of makeup and setting powder for shine and you can’t even tell I’m wearing sunscreen. Definitely recommend!

Amazing

I love french pharmacy products. And this is not one of my choice. It has high spf that is great but it get around eyes and it irrated constantly. Not its like sharp pain that makes you run to washroom but it's constantly mild annoyance you get. And flaky as other reviewer says. I won't wear with makeup. Unfortunately I bought 2 packs because of the promotion. Will use one the body. Hopefully wish its gone soon!

Best of the best of it all

Not gummy as other sunscreens of this 100 rating. Very light and yet covers the pace perfectly. My favorite.
