UPDATE BELOW This sunscreen is pretty good! I like that it has a high spf. Itâ€™s not exactly a milk, itâ€™s more like a creamy goo and it does leave a shine but no white cast. I donâ€™t care what they tell you, it feels like sunscreen on the face. I put it around my eyes and my eyes are a little irritated from it. Seems I canâ€™t avoid product transfer into my eyes no matter how I apply. ðŸ˜• it has no smell. If youâ€™re looking for a light non-sunscreen feeling sunscreen, keep looking. This isnâ€™t it. If you want a basic sunscreen workhorse that will protect you from the sun this one is good.  My issue is, I believe that the sun heats the product itself and that alone hurts my skin. I was truly hoping this would melt in and disappear but alas, no. Iâ€™ll have to wear a hat.  Update: yeah this stuff burns my eyes. I donâ€™t put it anywhere near my eyes and it burns. I have to apply a balm around the eyes first. Also I think this irritates my skin. Bummer, I really wanted this to work.

This is the first 100+ spf that I have found that doesn't cause any issues with makeup - in fact, it acts like a primer and makeup goes on over it really well! Really silky and smooth. I've been wearing it on long 3+ hour bike rides and also long runs and I haven't burned or anything. Great product!

I was so hesitant to buy this because every other 100SPF sunscreen I've tried leaves a white haze and is super thick and greasy. This is the exception! I've been using it on my face for about two weeks now and haven't had any problems. I think this is my new go-to sunscreen! Buy it!!

I keep buying it so I must be happy, I am in my 70's and my face is reasonable unlined and I give the credit to suntan lotion and I have been using LaRoche Posay for years now and am very happy with the results.

Made eyes itchy, caused me sneezing and runny nose for days, made me feel dizzy.

I thought I loved this product. I tried it for a few days using a sample from my dermatologist's office. The sample worked well enough, the price was good, decided to go on and purchase it. It was a mistake.  This sunscreen is not ALL bad. It's easy to spread and doesn't leave skin oily. There is almost no scent.  On the other hand, it PILLS LIKE CRAZY! Doesn't take long for little flakes of sunscreen to start appearing everywhere on my face. It sticks to my hairline and makes it look like I have dandruff. GROSS! The only way to make it stop pilling is to apply less than recommended for protection, which defeats the entire purpose of wearing sunscreen!  Sigh. I'll wear it until it's gone and find another sunscreen next time.

I finally found something that doesnâ€™t leave a white cast and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin! For years Iâ€™ve gone back and forth with different brands trying to find a sunscreen that wasnâ€™t gonna make me look like a clown or make my face burn and this is it! Not only that, it also smells way better than your average sunscreen and applies very well if your apply makeup over it. If youâ€™re a person of color or are just someone with super sensitive skin, like myself, I definitely recommend this product. Iâ€™ve used it everyday since I bought it.

Sadly, the sun screen runs soon after applying it to my face. I can taste it and it stings my eyes. So far, it has worked as a sun screen. I will finish the tube on my arms and legs but I will not reorder it.

For years I have been hiding from the sun because I have a sun allergy that causes me to break out in really itchy hives. I've tried other high SPF sunblock lotions and nothing worked until I tried La Roche-Posay SPF 100. I was able to spend 2 hours outside at a cookout and I didn't get hives. I finally have the freedom to go outside again! I will be using this wonderful product forever.

eos-eos

This product was extremely greasy. Too much so, even though i have very dry skin. It dwipes off easily because of the oily texture. I also think it gave me some pimples, likely because it is so occlusive.  I have never had this problem before with other products and sunscreens, but when i apply my truskin vitamin c serum underneath it, it PILLS and leaves little white chunks of product on my face.  I stopped using the product and switched back to neutrogena age shield SPF 110 and am loving it. That is a much better option for me

This is the BEST sunscreen I have ever used for my face!!! I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. This is the first sunscreen I have ever found that doesn't break out my skin. I have tried dozens in my life, inexpensive and expensive, and without fail they always break me out. I heard this was a good one, but was very skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised! I've been using it for several months now and it hasn't given me one zit. It doesn't clog my pores! I mixit with my daytime moisturizer. Then I use a matifyer on top, before my foundation, as a primer. My skin is clear and I finally have UV protection at 40!!!! I LOVE this product!!!

This sunscreen is chock full of the worst chemicals for coral reefs, the planet AND your health. I didn't look closely enough before I bought it. But once I got the product I realized my mistake and returned it (yay for Amazon Prime). In many places, including Hawaii, this sunscreen is banned, due to its evil chemicals!!! Also, some of these chemicals have been shown to have negative effects on your hormones.

eos-eos

Sunscreen keeps skin youthful. Forget all the expensive creams and serums. Invest in a strong sunscreen. This one is 100 spf. I have the 50 also. Love how these spread quickly and donâ€™t sting if younaccidentally get in your eyes, like most. Love the size.

eos-eos

I have tried many sunscreens, but none of them were compatible with wearing foundation on top. The foundation wouldn't spread evenly or if it did it would soon slide and gather in my "fine lines" which I don't want emphasized. But La Roche-Posay is perfect! My skin absorbs it and it leaves no residue. My foundation stays in place all day! And it's 100spf, which on its own has ben difficult for me to find. La Roche-Posay is so worth the $$

eos-eos

If you are looking for a thin sunscreen this is not the one for you! It is a very thick consistency but it rubs in easily. I get a bit of a white cast but not as bad as I have with others. I am very pale so it might be different for someone else. If I plan on wearing makeup with it I wait a bit for it to set in and have no issues but on my no makeup days I am good to go seconds later and know that I am being protected.

I was previously using Neutrogena Age Shield 110spf. However, the scent just didn't do good things for me. It gave me horrible migranes. That spf would honestly be a steal if they made it in fragrance free varieties.  This one is twice the price but worth it because its texture feels a lot lighter. The neutrogena one was somehow powdery and greasy at the same time. This one also doesn't leave a white cast.

I brought this sunscreen with me to Disneyland. I reapplied every few hours and did not get any sunburn at all. It's shiny but I like the glazed donut look. Many reviewers say this pills but this is my third bottle and has never been my experience. Highly recommend.

i have super pale sensitive skin and recently spent 10 days in Arizona. Didn't burn at all and spend a lot of time outside

I really wise they made a larger bottle with a pump. I could put it by the door, and always replenish my skin before I went outside. I have had several skin cancers removed (including half of my nose) and the screw on or flip top caps get a bit messy.

As a gal with the complexion of Casper, the Sun and I do not mesh well. I recently went on a trip to Florida & needed something to keep me from burning since I am not capable of gaining any other colorâ€¦ this worked WONDERS. Small enough for my Fanny pack and big enough to last me all day at a festival. Will buy again in the future to protect my sensitive skin!

My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen while treating both my adult acne and Melissa. Been using it for months now and live how lightweight and non greasy it is! It's worked beautifully with my skin issues too. Definitely sticking with this product.

eos-eos

Love it!! Iâ€™m out in the sun all day & it stays out for several hours. If my skin is dry, it does pill & ball up and come off. I make sure I moisturize before using it, let the moisturizer dry then put it on. No white cast, no burning feeling. It looks a little greasy but Iâ€™ll take it. Great chemical sunscreen for sensitive, dry skin!

eos-eos

This gives me the best sun protection of any sunscreen Iâ€™ve used! It feels light and spreads well. The slight white cast disappears very quickly!! The only thing is that it does sting if it gets in the eyes

eos-eos

I can't usually tolerate chemical sunscreens, but this one doesn't burn and irritate my sensitive skin. I'm still avoiding around the eyes though. They sting with any chemical sunscreens around them. The texture is nice, spreads evenly and melts in beautifully. I wouldn't recommend it if you have oily skin, though. It has a glowy finish.

100 SPF, if you have fair skin like I do. It's important to get A sun screen that will offer good protection and this does the job very well. It has a high rating as a top notch sun screen and who could ask for anything more!

eos-eos

I needed extra protection for my sensitive skin. This goes on so easy and creamy

eos-eos

It melts in your skin as advertised and provides truly great sun protection. I spent hours and consecutive days in the sun at the beach and did not burn. It also did NOT leave any white or ashy look on my skin after being applied. This is great. It has been hard to find a sunscreen that does not leave that white ghostly look on darker complexions.

Once you rub it between your fingers for a few seconds before applying it absorbs very well into the skin (Iâ€™m black so donâ€™t be scared to buy it queens)

I recently discovered I'm allergic to zinc and have been searching for a good zinc-free sunblock. This creme is light and easy to spread and protects my pale Irish skin really well.

This product does go on smoothly. It doesn't leave a white residue when applying. I would definitely purchase again!

This sunscreen disappears when applied to the facial skin. It provides invisible protection eliminating the white face ghost effect.

I was so pleased by this product! I have pale sensitive skin and was going on a beach vacation. This product was great, exactly what I needed. Bonus- it made my skin feel fantastic!

The product worked as expected. It was easy to apply and I didnâ€™t have any issues with it streaking or not rubbing on easily. I would recommend.

It does NOT irritate my skin. Perfect!

I like that I have to use such a small amount on my face to get full coverage. It's a good product.

Great spread under makeup and ease absorbible by the skin. Excellent solar protection. Not skin irritant ingredients.

A good alternative for those with darker skin as this doesnâ€™t make you look like youâ€™re caked ðŸ˜‘ Easy to apply and good overall protection.

I love this sunblock...goes on smooth and not oily.

Not gummy as other sunscreens of this 100 rating. Very light and yet covers the pace perfectly. My favorite.

My skin is really sensitive. I havenâ€™t found any sunscreen that does k on my skin. This not only does k itâ€™s WONDERFUL!! My allergies are also bad so until now i wasnâ€™t able to use sunscreen without my eyes burning and terrible skin reactions. I didnâ€™t put any sunblock near my eyes before. Iâ€™m able to put this above my cheekbones and this doesnâ€™t make my skin cake up our oily looking itâ€™s absolutely perfect. I actually seen this product from my favorite influencer on Instagram. Ladies itâ€™s everything you have been looking for and more in a sunscreen. Donâ€™t think about it go ahead and order this. Itâ€™s saving your skin from damage and itâ€™s also great to use spf ðŸ’¯ itâ€™s perfect.
