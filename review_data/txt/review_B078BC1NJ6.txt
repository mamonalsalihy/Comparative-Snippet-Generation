The spray on sun screen i actually use in pair with a sunblock that I apply by hand to reach places I can't myself. This one is sprayed on, but it's better when it's spread again by hand. Not necessary, but I feel like it helps with the coverage. This is not quite so thick in coverage where you feel smothered by it's weight because it's a sprayed on one, so that's great. It's definitely more expensive than the hand applied one for sure, but it's definitely far more convenient.

The package arrives well sealed and have no issues with leakage. I have not gotten a single sunburn since using this daily and it doesn't leave me feeling slimy or gross all over like so many other sunscreens do. It does seem to fade after a few hours of activity so I reapply every couple hours when I am out in the sun. The pricing feels right as well!

Needed bulk supply to send to camp. Like that the caps lock for suitcases. No one got burned, so it must have worked!

best way to use sunscreen its in spray, so much easier for the kind of people who doesn't like to be using it every day, this way you can just apply it after taking a bath and just get going i carry one bottle in my purse for the times i have to reapply and for the days that i forget to apply it in the morning

I sunburn extremely easily and always need to reapply. This product definitely did the job and kept me from burning without being greasy or making me sweat too much.

eos-eos

There is not too much to say here, except that it does the job. I like the 3-pack because both of my kids were in summer camp this summer. I kept one in each of their string backs, and had one extra for myself.

We use this as our go-to sunscreen around the pool, for hiking, as well as travel. Easy to use, light fragrance, good protection from sun

eos-eos

Great product Easy to apply Up and down !  Only One call out Even after 20 min , As soon as you enter the water, the product goes away and heavily pollutes the water, leaving oil stains all over the surface . I was so embarrassed at the river .

Living in Florida we go thru our fair share of sunscreen... so we have tested a lot. I love that this is a combo pack. I was pleasantly surprised by the nice smell and would definitely order again. Great value too. Last long and was good protection.

Only a little tacky once rubbed in; much better than the lotion sunscreens IMO. Has always worked well for sun protection as long as reapplied as instructed. Remember to rub it in otherwise it's easy to miss certain areas!

Bought these for golf outings. So far played 3 times and no sunburn. I haven’t gotten much of a tan though either. Average scent as far as sunscreen goes. Good product and would buy again and would recommend

eos-eos

love this product. so much easier than the liquid. goes on easily and gives my skin the protection i desire, enough to keep me from burning but allowing some natural color to come through. definitely my go to and highly recommend for those looking for protection and easy application

It works quite well if your not in the sun very long but for long periods of time you have to reapply it to work well. I ended up with a sunburn after using it.

eos-eos

We've tried many others and always come back to the Coppertone Sport.

eos-eos

Can’t have enough sunscreen. We have this product on subscription. It always come just when we need it.

eos-eos

Very good product, have had no sunburns. They all work great!so far the best deal I’ve found on sunscreen.

eos-eos

I burn very easily, so I re-apply this through out the day at the beach and it helps! I find it less tacky than the Neutrogena, easier to wash off in the shower. You may find better value in local stores though so check around

Living here in Texas, it's the best, cleanest, non-greasy protection I've ever used. We've never been sunburned since using this over the past year.

eos-eos

Dries quick and works

eos-eos

It will save you heaps so you don't have to buy it at a huge markup at the beach or on the trail.

Needed some sunscreen for my pale skin and Coppertone is the OG. I love the value pack and love the spray. It’s a great sunscreen

eos-eos

I use this all summer in my jeep with the top off... highly recommend

I strongly encourage you NOT to use this brand. My daughter used it on her arms and received very severe chemical burns on her hands and arms, documented by her physician. Google it, there have been many confirmed cases. I tried to attach pics but Amazon wouldn't allow them to be posted.

eos-eos

Love this brand and pretty much only use this :)

eos-eos

Favorite sunscreen. Great for active people who may sweat during use. Protects you from the sun and is easy to apply.

eos-eos

Works are expected. No problems

eos-eos

Follow directions It works My daughter hates rub on sunscreen so this reduces battles of ‘put on your sunscreen’ I like it for me too, it’s lightweight not greasy

eos-eos

Offers great protection for a good price, the sun hasn’t bothered me since I put this on. In fact, this sunscreen is so powerful that the sun is afraid to come out.

eos-eos

Great protection for head and arms.

eos-eos

Love the great scent and effectiveness. Can’t beat it

eos-eos

This is a classic high quality sunscreen spray and it is good value for the cost. Lasts a long time, strong spray, smells nice. Highly recommended

eos-eos

Prevents sunburn, great for workouts.

eos-eos

Using it for a while now, it's good. I would definitely recommend it to others, doesnt get all greasy like the other products out there. And it feels cool on even with the sun shining on you.

eos-eos

Lotions are more effective and last longer, but if you need a spray for your scalp or the top of your feet, this is your spray.

eos-eos

Sprays a very fine mist that's easy to apply and dries very quickly. Smells strongly of sunscreen and that doesn't really fade much over time.

eos-eos

Typical sunscreen protection. Goes on fairly dry. Pleasant smell.

eos-eos

coppertone is great for tanning and not burning.

eos-eos

This stuff works great. Protect is great at 50.

eos-eos

My favorite sunscreen! Never burned with this

eos-eos

I cut trees, sometimes in direct sunlight, no choice. I have not had one single sunburn while using this product, my skin does not react in any negative way. I recommend spraying it in a messy fashion and rubbing it around for full coverage. Re-apply every 4 hours I would say.

eos-eos

Great product the smell is great as well.

eos-eos

Good

eos-eos

This was and will remain my go to every summer. Great protection, easy to use, smells good and lasts long.

eos-eos

It’s good

eos-eos

Overall very happy with this. Seems to work for a few hours, easy to throw in a bag, has a great lock function.

eos-eos

I recommend it. I use it every day and have seen good effects, approved by my dermatologist, it has good chemical and physical protective elements.

eos-eos

Worth every peny. Doesn't leave oily feeling and protects from the sun. Good stuff

eos-eos

This sunscreen works well. The three pack is useful. One for the car. One for the house. And one for the beach bag.

eos-eos

Perfect nice and light, amd does what's expected.

I guess it work's ok. My doctor will tell me next month.
