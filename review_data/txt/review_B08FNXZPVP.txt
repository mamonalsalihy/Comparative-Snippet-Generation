I love this sunscreen. My husband's upper body is completely covered in tattoos and I cover him completely before he goes out to work. When he sweats (excessively) the sweat just beads off. This is an amazing product and totally worth the money. If you want it to rub completely into your skin just don't use as much. But I like that I can see a light white film over his tattoos. It reinsures me that he's covered. AND for me I put this on my leg tattoo, I used to have to also cover it with a towel or I'd feel like it was on fire from the sun. This this sunscreen I don't have to do that! Highly recommended!

Great product! I am fair skinned and no other sun block has worked as well as this. I am outside for my work on average 6 hours a day. I have to just apply the sunscreen once in the morning and am good for the rest of the day. It’s not greasy and goes on easily. Located in Texas so you know it gets hot! Smells pleasant too!

This was recommended by a friend who spends much time in the garden sun. Then recommended by my dermatologist. Love it and feel protected.

This was originally recommended by my dermatologist and it works great.

Sun protection not bad mineral base safe to use at least

Agree with some of the other reviewers on here. I don't think I've ever ordered Elta Active before so I can't speak to whether the formula changed, but it doesn't really rub into the skin and leaves a white cast (especially with non-pale skin tones or if you have a tan). Elta Sport, which I have regularly used, does rub into the skin. That being said, however, I feel like Elta Active might do a slightly better sun protection job just because it is so thick and sits on top of the skin. When I sweat when running, Elta Active also seems to stay on better than Elta Sport does... although I might only think that because I can see the white cast haha.  I've also used Zealios Sun Barrier a while ago, which doesn't leave as much of a white cast (if any), and is more affordable. But I feel like it came off kind of easily when sweating. Coppertone Pure and Simple (their mineral sunscreen line) came out a couple years ago -- the lotion was runny, left a slight white cast, and wasn't super great in active conditions. But it looks like they have since come out with stick and spray versions that I'm interested in trying out. Coppertone is of course also more affordable than Elta is.  I started using mineral sunscreens because I somehow developed eczema one summer and your run-of-the-mill, drugstore and Coppertone chemical sunscreens made me itchy beyond belief. I just used a chemical spray-on the other day for easy application and invisibility and am already starting to get those itchy reactions again -- so pastiness in Elta Active or any other mineral sunscreen is a small price to pay for happy skin. But definitely check out Elta Sport if you want less white cast. Elta Shield is pretty good too -- it's lighter for the face. Elta Physical is also for the face. It's tinted but still leaves a bit of a cast for me, plus the tint gets on my clothes, so it's not my favorite.

I’m in awe of this sunscreen. It’s NOT greasy. Does not make my face break up. I apply it first thing in morning. Give it two minutes then apply my foundation etc over it. Later in the day I apply more without disturbing my makeup by just patting it all over. It absorbs in without a trace. It’s so lightweight you don’t even know you’re wearing it. As per my dermatologist, it’s doing what it’s supposed to and my skin is not being damaged any more by lights or the sun.

I got this product because the spray version was no longer available. This product works for sun protection but in no way is transparent. You can rub and rub till you feel like your skin is raw and it is still white. I feel like a clown everyday in the pool teaching. Please bring back the old pump spray.

eos-eos

I didn't realize how difficult the lotion was in absorbing into your skin. My arms and legs were white until i got out in the sun, and then the white gradually disappeared, Maybe because the SPF was a 50. I had never used a 50spf before. The white color was in the creases of my arms and also my knees. I tried another brand of SPF 50, and it went on much more smoothly.

eos-eos

My dermatologist recommends this brand for sunscreen. I purchased this on Amazon because I thought it would be easier than waiting for my appointment. The version my dermatologist sold provided excellent coverage even if it left a little white residue. This version -- however -- makes me break out in a rash. so, either the formula changed ... or this is a fake version. for the price, best not to chance it. Best just to buy 100% zinc instead.

Feels thick and is whitish on skin. Had good experience with the smaller, more expensive bottles. But, this larger container has a thick and whitish feel. I will not purchase this one again.

Purchased this for a two week vacation in Costa Rica. Worked great! My husband is very fair skinned and burns easily, this kept him burn free even in intense sun. It leaves a white sheen, but wasn’t a big deal on his fair skin (more noticeable on my tan skin). A little goes a long way- well worth the price.

eos-eos

It's really expensive, but has been effective at preventing sun poisoning, burns and most sun bumps even when out for days on water/snow

I do not like the fact the zinc oxide is not clear! It stays white on my skin. The sunscreen is good protection, but do not like looking like a snowman

Waste of money for a product that was expired!!!

I am a big fan of Elta MD sunscreens, I usually get the UV SPORT. I ordered this by mistake, and it is really super hard to apply, especially on my arms and legs. Even after a while it leaves my face very white, which has not been the case wiht the UV Sport.

I love mineral sunscreens because I'm fairly sensitive to the ingredients in many chemical sunscreens; however, they are so hard to rub in and often leave behind that chalky white residue that looks even worse after it gets wet. I deal with it because I prioritize the sun protection, but I always hate it. This is a pricey sunscreen; I'm not sure what ingredients are in it that justify the price versus other mineral sunscreens, but I love that it doesn't leave that residue behind. Since it's winter (and the pools are on lockdown) I haven't been able to give it a thorough test as far as it being waterproof, but I did have water beading off the back of my hands when I exposed them to water and I could feel the residue (not uncomfortable, but I could feel it) on my face later in the day.  It doesn't burn my eyes or seem to run; it didn't interfere with my makeup application or change my makeup (some turn my foundation orange).  I would definitely recommend this if you like mineral sunscreens but hate the chalky residue. This is the first one I've found that exceeds my expectations (except in price). I am not factoring price into this review because, as far as beauty goes, it's a personal thing, but if it's in your price range it's a good choice.

EltaMD is one of my favorite skincare brands. I have yet to try a product of theirs that I didn’t love. Insofar as I was able to test it — in the winter in the Midwest — this sunscreen is no exception. It’s great.  So, I mean...there’s not a lot of sunshine outside my door right now. There’s a whole lotta clouds, some snow and it’s approximately 25 degrees. Certainly not optimal for testing out a sunscreen. But! I gave it the old college try anyway, and wore it in lieu of lotion in the morning on my face, arms and chest for a couple days. So, while I can’t comment on how well it kept me from burning in the sun, here’s what I can say:  * It’s easy to apply and soaks in quickly. * Didn’t irritate my skin at all. I have really pale, sensitive skin. Any tiny issue with an ingredient in anything I apply to my skin shows up in a big way almost immediately. I had absolutely no issues or problems with this product. It played very nicely with my skin. Love that. * A little goes a long way. I hate it when sunscreens are suuuuuuper thick and it feels like you’re futilely trying to coat yourself in a layer of cement. This wasn’t like that at all. Much more like a lotion, which is a refreshing change. * I applied it to my face and put makeup over the top of it like I would the moisturizer with SPF I normally use and didn’t really notice any substantive difference. It’s maybe a little thicker feeling on my face, specifically, but not in a really noticeable way. * It didn’t leave me feeling sticky. * Seems to make good on its claims to be water resistant. I used it on my arms, and whenever I’d wash my hands, the water would bead right up on my arms. * Didn’t stain my clothes. This is HUGE!  I’m looking forward to using this product again when it’s finally sunny outside once more. If I have any additional details to add after I can test it in the sun, I’ll come back and update this review.

I will have to test it out better over the summer or at least sunnier days, as it is winter now, but so far I like it.  I use sunscreen year round due to tretinoin use and the brands/types I use vary on the season because I need something super good in the spring and summer but fall and winter I use a little bit less of an spf and use up some that maybe I didn't like so much for outdoor summer use.  I have melasma, so it is important for me to have something that really protects my from rays because even with sunscreen melasma will continue to darken. As it is February now, there is not much sun yet for me to gauge how well it works in that regard but I will update with that come spring summer.  For now, I can say that I love that the zinc doesn't dry out my skin as bad as some other sunscreens that ive tried. Since I do use it everyday, it is important for it to not be super drying. It also doesn't leave as much of a white cast, but again that is something that will be better tested in the summer in direct sun, sweating etc because that seems to be when that white mess is most visible, or you sweat it off etc.  This breaks down and comes off pretty easily with face cleanser, too.

If it's a product from EltaMD you know it's high quality stuff. One of my top favorite serums is an EltaMD serum. This sunscreen rubs in very quickly, which is important to me because I don't typically have time to fool around rubbing sunscreen in for longer than a minute. And no white cast! The only thing that puts me off from saying this is something I'll reorder is the cost. It's high quality, for sure, but I'd almost rather buy the $10 bottles and have to apply more often than spend $50 all at once on this. But if cost isn't an issue then get this. EltaMD doesn't disappoint.

This sunscreen lotion offers supreme sun protection SPF 50+ - EltaMD Sunscreen Lotion. It applies in a very thick white coat that rubs across the skin to produce a transparent layer. This is not a quick grab and slap on lotion. It’s a heavier ointment so needs to be applied evenly. A white shimmer will let you know what needs to be smoothed out. There is only a slight greasy feel. It’s water resistant for 80 minutes so handles intense beach activity - surfing, lifeguarding. The smell is neutral leaning and reminds me of clay. It’s transparent zinc oxide - the best description. The safety seal is located inside the screw-off top and not on the actual tube.

My face is full of freckles. To avoid getting more freckles or making the existing freckles darker and bigger, I use face sunscreen everyday (plus take D3 vitamin daily). This sunscreen is expensive but it is sooo good. A little goes a long way. It doesn't have a scent, no chemicals and it doesn't feel sticky on the skin. I totally recommend you try this product. I just wished it was more economical.

Being outdoors more recently means that I have to put on a bunch of sunblock or else I will get burnt. I also need to apply it to not only my body but also to my face. This is when I came across this product and thought it was a good fit for me to use.  Quality/Product: I would say the product and quality of this is pretty good. The sunscreen is easy to apply; however, you will need to rub it in a little more compared to other products or else you'll be left with white streaks. Something that I noticed right away when I used this product was that it wasn't exactly fragrance free. Sure, they don't put any added smells to it but the original smell of sun lotion just doesn't smell really good. Kind of smells like dry glue. I wish they would have added some natural scents to balance that smell out. The water-resistance on it is great though. I sweat a bunch even just walking for around 30 minutes so this was a relief as I didn't need to constantly reapply.  Overall, happy with this product and would recommend.

This is a nice physical sunscreen. I like physical sunscreens because they aren't packed with chemicals but they can be a little harder to work with than traditional sunscreens. I've struggled with other brands and found them hard to rub in so they weren't white anymore and found the consistency lacking. This Elta sunscreen is much better! It takes a little effort to rub in, but once you do, there isn't a white tint left behind. Like most physical sunscreens, it's kind of thick but it's easy to work with. The best part of this sunscreen is NO GREASY hands. Seriously. You rub it in and your hands are dry. Some people have complained about the scent. This is a fragrance free sunscreen so you do get the lotion-y scent but I don't find it off-putting. If you're looking to switch to a physical sunscreen and have room in your budget for a higher-end sunscreen, you won't be disappointed with this one.

This is my second tube of Elta MD sunscreen, and unless something goes very wrong I don’t see any reason to change brands any time soon. This stuff is awesome. I have quite sensitive skin and a history of breakouts, and anything that sits heavily on my skin is my kryptonite. I’ve reacted so poorly to sunscreen in the past that for a couple of years I just stopped using it, which is why i now look like a beat up paper bag as I approach my 40s.  Elta’s sunscreen goes on easy without streaking, and even better it really isn’t at all greasy, so as promised it won’t run into your eyes when you sweat. It doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and since I started using it I’ve had no sunscreen-related breakouts.  I do have one slight criticism, though. I may be in the minority here but I quite like the traditional scent of cheap sunscreen. To me it’s the scent of summer, and I kinda wish this had the same aroma. It’s billed as unscented but it’s not completely without scent, and what it has doesn’t really evoke anything for me. I’d not unpleasant, but catching a whiff of it in the middle of winter doesn’t make me dream of those hot beach days. Still, this is a minor gripe. All in all this stuff is awesome.

The media could not be loaded. I had written a long and decent review but since the amazon app wants to delete everything I wrote because of some stupid camera and photos permission this is what you get now. The ONLY good thing I can say about this product is yes, I am currently not sunburned. My issues with this sunscreen are just as bad however. I purchased this product to apply it before going out to the pool in the summer. Multiple times now, the result has left me with dry feeling skin that lasts over 24 hours and small rashes forming on my body. So the result looks no different than getting an actual sunburn except now it’s a rash. I use Eucerin eczema relief lotion daily which is an ultra rich and thick lotion I only have to apply once a day for hydrated skin and has, in the past, gotten rid of some limited eczema I’ve had. This Elta sunscreen product leaves my skin feeling so dry, that a shower plus multiple applications of the Eucerin lotion don’t seem to get rid of the dryness or the rashes. This is both ironic and an embarrassment considering all the smack people talk about “chemical sunscreens” which I’ve used all my life so far without obvious issues but this first bottle of “mineral” sunscreen I get is already causing unwanted side effects within days. It’s an extremely expensive product and they claim it’s dermatologist backed which just adds to the irony of the situation. I’ll try one more mineral sunscreen from a different brand but if the result is the same, I’m going back to the “horrendous” chemical ones and determining that society just likes to fear monger to sell products.

I have tried a huge variety of sunscreens through the years, from drugstore, high end, and indie brands. This is by far one of the best ones I have tried over the years. The formula is fragrance free, great for those that are sensitive to fragrances, or have sensitive skin. It is light weight, non-sticky, and rubs in very well. It does not leave a grey or white cast on your skin, and also does not give that tight, drying feeling some zinc oxide based sunscreens tend to have. Works well for the whole family, Highly recommended for daily, everyday use, especially on the face, neck, and hands.

Elta MD is the sunscreen brand touted by every dermatologist on social media as the holy grail of sunscreens. I bought the oil-free facial version that is supposed to be light, non-greasy, non-comedogenic, and leaves no white residue, and I found it to be thick, greasy, white, and broke me out. So with a dubious eye, I ordered this one.  It's thick, like rubbing paste into your skin, and it definitely leaves a white caste behind. Supposed to be fragrance-free, but there's a scent of clay or something similar. It's everything I hate about sunscreen, but it's no worse than most other brands, I suppose. I'll still use it, but I don't think it's worth $50-$60. (Especially since you're supposed to use a full ounce on your body and it's an 8 ounce tube, so if you're on a beach vacation, this will probably last less than a week.)

I'm a very pale girl so sunscreen is a must for me but I don't enjoy smelling like sunscreen all the time. This is truly the first sunscreen I have ever used that doesn't smell like sunscreen at all. I have very sensitive skin as well and this hasn't caused any reaction including on my face. It feels a bit thick out of the bottle but a little goes a longgg way with this stuff and it soaks into your skin really well and doesn't end up feeling thick or greasy. Overall this is a great sunscreen and would recommend it to anyone!

EltaMD is the sunscreen that my dermatologist recommended I use. I have very fair skin and sunburn easily. I also get sunspots. I have been using this sunscreen for two years, and it protects my face and hands well.  It does generate a white sheen on my face when I put it on, but it becomes almost invisible in time once it gets absorbed. Note that I said "almost" invisible, a slight white tinge remains. This sunscreen is almost unscented, there is a light scent of something mild just as I put it on, but not offensive.  Purchased in November 2020, expiration date May 2022.  Ali Julia review

I like to research skincare products. And some friends of mine would ask me how to choose products. When it comes to sunscreen, there is always a sunscreen from EltaMD on my recommendation list. This sunscreen is excellent. A large cube. I guess it's enough for me to use for a year. It feels comfortable on my skin, not heavy, no fake white, and not greasy. The smell is acceptable.

eos-eos

It's Winter and I'm in quarantine so I haven't been able to use this as much as I would like. The few times I have it worked really well. I don't use this on my face (have a separate one I mix with creams) only the body. No problems getting everything absorbed and I didn't find white chalky-ness on my arms or all over my clothing. Not a fan of the smell.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen, it really feels like more of a rich body lotion. At first it seems like it will leave a white cast, but it blends quickly. It smells very light, almost a colloidal oatmeal scent, which makes it wearable for every day. This is the perfect lotion for my arms and chest each day.

eos-eos

This is a nice sunscreen. I appreciate that there are no additional chemical added for my family to use. The size is good for a mineral sunscreen, as so many other brands are smaller in size. This is thick and you do need to rub it in, it has a slight smell to it.

eos-eos

I like that it's chemical-free and fragrance-free, so that it does not irritate your skin or make you smell like not yourself. But this lotion is difficult to spread out evenly and needs more rubbing than other sunscreen I used.

eos-eos

Large, tube of mineral sunscreen, though it didn't seem to be very full (but did arrive sealed, so know it's new). Takes a bit to blend, but good for sensitive skin, waterproof and full coverage. Good for those who burn easily and/or have sensitive skin. Pricey, but not out of the realm of the norm for sunscreen of this quality.

SO THIS SUNSCREEN LOTION IS GREAT FOR THE SKIN. I PUT IT ON YEAR ROUND.

Good sunscreen. Not the best, but certainly good enough.
