...sharing this.  Misses Shops too much is the sunscreen queen and has had her influence on me in using and selecting sunscreen; mineral based and waterproof for swimming is what I now look for.  Before I go on, let me just make something really clear, because it wasn't to me. If you read the product page, I think they have tried to be clear, but....  What you will get:  Two, tubes with 3.4 ounces of product each, for a total of 6.8 ounces.  I found the product headline "6.8 oz (2 Pack)" to be ambiguous and thought I would get a 2 pack with two tubes containing 6.8 ounces each.  Frankly for $72.00, I don't think that's an unreasonable assumption. Later down in the page text is a bullet point showing:  "TRAVEL FRIENDLY - 3.4 Fl oz for TSA Security Checks, Made in the USA "  Okay.  Now that we're clear on what you will get for your $72.00.....  This comes in a tube with a flip cap.  As it comes out, it looks like a, on the darker side of medium, shade of liquid foundation.  Not something your average male might use.  So first I put some on my hand....feels good, rubbed in quickly and to me, a little on the olive skin tone colored, I couldn't see it after it rubbed in.  I like waterproof for my lap swim workouts (in a public chlorinated pool) not only for the sun protection but as a barrier against the pool chems.  Today I used it on my face; a bit tan and sometimes red; same effect, rubbed in easily and quickly, felt good, moisturizing, and again, I couldn't really see a tint, despite how dark the product looked coming out of the tube.  There was a bit of sheen/shine on my face immediately after applying the product, but that's pretty normal with the white zinc based waterproof sunscreens (on me anyway) also.  It held up well during a 75 minute swim and came off easily in the shower using a mild/gentle skin cleansing gel.  Like I said, I'm not sharing; I like this stuff.  Honestly, this is way out of my price range, but maybe not yours. For that reason only, I would not reorder it.  Great Product, glad I ordered it. If money is no concern for you, consider this a 5 star rating.  I hope this review has enabled you to make an informed purchase decision.  I rarely give an overall 5 star rating.

Sonrei Clearly Zinq Tinted Zinc Mineral Face and Body Gel Sunscreen SPF 45 | 6.8 oz (2 Pack) $72.00  I was excited to try this sunscreen. I live in a hot climate and have a small collection of various sunscreens, I am not super picky but this though was a completely new and unique experience! Upon first application there is a strong smell of oil. You know, like canola oil, that kind of smell. That’s not a big deal but it is something I did notice immediately, but once applied I did not really smell it any longer. This stuff is thick and oily. I was not expecting this kind of consistency. This claims that it is water resistant, and I believe it as it is so oily! I cannot imagine any moisture combating this stuff. This feels heavy on my skin, definitely not what I would consider to be lightweight. I worry with it being tinted and so thick that I could potentially stain clothing and would be difficult to remove from clothing (it is water resistant!). I think this would be great for the beach or hiking, any kind of outdoor activity that involves prolonged sun exposure. You will not get sunburn after wearing this, as it is so thick and I feel like it will block everything (including your pores!) Because this is so thick this would not be ideal for daily use on one's face. This is too oily to wear under makeup and I feel like this would clog pores of those who are acne prone. I have dry/combination skin and felt like this was putting me at risk for breakouts (and I don’t even get breakouts!). I love that this has good ingredients and is fragrance-free...but the oiliness and the thickness isn’t something I am pleased about. I plan to use the rest of the bottle I opened and donate the second bottle. Would not repurchase.

Listen, I love tinted sunscreens, but this is too much. I’m by no means the palest of the pale, but I am on the fairer side and this turned up basically orange on my skin. THANKFULLY, when rubbed in, it didn’t turn me super orange, but it definitely made a difference in my skin tone. You can compare pictures of my hand before and after to see. It’s not a *bad* color, necessarily? But it will make your skin darker if you’re on the fair side.  Other than the color, it feels very sticky and greasy. I tried it out as a facial sunscreen and noped out of that really quick. It made my face way too dark, exaggerated my redness, and didn’t really blur or cover up imperfections – it basically just changed my skin tone. In addition, it clumps any powder you put on top of it and it smells really strongly of sunscreen. No thanks. I’ll stick to wearing a facial sunscreen under my foundation.  The only reason this is two stars and not one is because the tint doesn’t rub off on anything after you rub it in. I tested it out by rubbing my sunscreen’d hand on an inconspicuous part of my couch – no ugly beige streak or beige fingerprints. So this works okay as a body sunscreen, but definitely NOT for facial use. And $72? Definitely not worth the price.

I like the feel of the sunscreen on the skin after about 15 minutes. There’s barely a tint but I do have yellow toned medium light skin. But it’s hard to detect that you are wearing any tint on your face or body- just a natural glow. A little goes a long way, but you should always over apply sunscreen for adequate protection. Because I always use a lot, it takes forever to dry. The texture is like a thick foundation but spreads easily across the skin into a gel consistency. It leaves an orangey tint but after about 15 mins, the orange cast was gone. It leaves my skin soft and there’s a slight glow or sheen but it’s absolutely not greasy or oily. It feels almost like a primer. Soft texture after it dries. The only negative would be the scent. It’s not horrible but it does smell like waxy crayons or clay. And it lingers for a long time. The sunscreen does have lots of great ingredients. My skin feels moisturized and soft but it’s a little expensive for sunscreen. And considering the fragrance I don’t know that it’s a great value. Feels nice on the skin when dry though.

This Sonrei Zinq Mineral sunscreen is amedium/lightweight gel with a light sun-kissed tint. It spreads easily and absorbs moderately. This mineral sunscreen uses 24% Zinc(Uv protection, treats acne, anti-inflammatory, heals skin) to protect you from the sun. It also has other ingredients that are great for your skin such as:  -Vitamin C (Brightening, hydrating, promotes collagen production, fades hyperpigmentation, anti-aging)  -Vitamin E (Antioxidant, moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging)  -Ferulic acid (Works great with Vitamin C, repairs damaged cells, brightening, anti-inflammatory, clear skin, anti-aging)  This Sunscreen left my skin very hydrated, soft and dewy. The formula looks orange at first but once your spread it on your skin, it gives you a natural looking glow. I am planning on going swimming today, so I’ll update on whether not it holds up in the sun and water. I have no complaints as of right now though, I like it!

What I love about Sonrei's Clearly Zinq sunscreen is that it is mineral based, has SPF 45, easy to use and absorbent, no nasty white residue, nice tint and it's a two pack which each tube being sealed and a great size to travel with. What I don't love is the smell! I'm not sure how to describe it but it smells like chemicals to me which is weird because it's a mineral sunscreen. The smell isn't horrible or anything (I definitely have had worse) and it's not super strong and overpowering, but it's not a pleasant aroma to me.

I wanted to love this product but it's just ok for me. The tint makes no noticeable difference in appearance. If I applied it only one half of my face, no one would notice and it feels greasy on my skin. For the price, I don't like it at all it's very expensive but if price is not a factor, I'd say it's just an ok product and I wouldn't buy it again.

This Sonrei tinted sunscreen is quickly absorbed into the skin but leaves a little shine. It feel light on the skin. I don't usually like tinted sunscreen but the shade is not overly dark.
