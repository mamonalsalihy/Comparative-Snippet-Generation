I put this on and felt super pampered going out to absorb some sun.. it makes the skin feel super soft and it smells amazing. I am prone to breaking out with certain lotions but this did not do that. It also kinda made my skin sparkle very subtly in the sun. I think theres like reflective minerals in it or something. All in all it's a really great product. Also, my skin is pale... I did not burn while using this and I stayed out for around 2 hours.

Just got these today, so I haven't tested the sun-protection quality yet. I'll update if any remarkable new info comes up. The lotion itself has a lovely, creamy texture and is nicely moisturizing without being oily. As for scent, I actually love a strong sunscreen smell, but most people don't, and they'll love this stuff. The sunscreen smell I love is in there, it's just subtle. It also has a coconut smell, which also isn't overbearing (people who hate strong smelling sunscreen will be very happy with this one). Other than that, I DID expect the bottles to be bigger (should have looked at the ounces, but I'm a visual person), but the price-point seems to be pretty standard for sunscreens. ($20 for two isn't bad at all, considering the great quality). I will definitely buy these again, as long as the sun protection is good.

I LOVE this sunscreen. It feels so good on the skin. It has a lovely scent that I would describe as a very light floral. Not overwhelming at all and not the usual coconutty smell. The added bonus is that it’s really moisturizing. AND it gives the skin a beautiful glow rather than an oily/greasy sheen. It really is the best I’ve ever used. I’ll buy it as long as they sell it.

My favorite sunscreen lotion. I wear it as daily moisturizer all summer long. Absorbs well, not too greasy, and smells good. It does sometimes leave an orangish stain on edges of clothes. Also a little difficult to get the last 15% or so out of the bottle.

I use a LOT of sunscreen, and I got this with a promotional coupon figuring I would try it. I was surprised that it actually DOES feel weightless... I will probably continue to splurge on this given that I am more likely to reapply when I should if I have something I like this much!  Note that it's smaller than other Hawaiian Tropic bottles - that wasn't obvious to me.

This sunscreen has an amazing scent, but not to over bearing. Stays on in water for 80 minutes. Does not dry your skin out but leaves it feeling very moisturized. Will definitely buy again and recommen to others. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle. This is only 6 ounces.

Love this product. Great for sensitive skin and for someone who burns easily.

Nothing to dislike.

Love the fragrance and it works well.

Have always loved the way this feels after it’s out on

Really moisturizing and silky. Not heavy and greasy like a lot of sunscreens.

Amazing. I haven't burned one time since I decided to buy these. I work outside a lot of the time, so I'm always in the rays of the sun. I don't typically burn but I started to badly in the beginning of this year cause I wasn't outside as much at first due to covid19. This saved me from the intense sun rays and I'm forever greatful!

Pros: Good sun protection when reapplied frequently. I did not get burned with this one as I have with other brands. Nice scent, but a bit overpowering. Great for those who like a lot of fragrance. Cons: Burns my eyes and my face. No response from Hawaiian Tropic to my email concerning this. It might be considered moisturizing, but I found it to be a bit greasy.  All in all it's a decent purchase. I would recommend for the protection but probably won't purchase again myself.

I’m sure the product is good (I’m guessing) but one of the bottles came completely broken. I also bought the face cream too and it came used. Talk about disgusting. Go to CVS-

I have been a long time customer of Hawaiian Tropic sunscreens, but sadly no longer. I ordered this sunscreen knowing the product, because I have used it before. I don’t know if these are fake, or if they have changed the sunscreen solution, but it completely stained my bathing suit! Brand new bikini I bought for my honeymoon completely stained yellow and ruined the first time I wore it. NOT HAPPY. I tried to wear the sunscreen again while working out, and it stained my dark colored top! This stuff is awful, do not buy, I threw both bottles in the trash. I’m a Sun Bum customer now.

Got 2 bottle (6 fl. oz. each) pack at the end of Mar 2022, with expiry of Dec 2022. Not sure if it is possible to use two bottles in such a narrow time frame. Otherwise, the cream seems fine, though is it not non-greasy completely. You could say that it is less greasy than many other creams.

I love this brand of sunscreen. I love the way it feels and smells. I am protected from sunburn yet get some color. My issue is the expiration date of July 2022. I feel like the price was right because it is nearly outdated product.

eos-eos

Great for the skin to be protected by the sun. Only con I have for the body lotion is that it expires in a month. Face lotion is up to 2 years. Wouldn't buy the body lotion again, since I was sent an old one.

For some reason, this product contains an orange-colored dye and therefore will stain everything it comes in contact with: Clothing, furniture, towels, toenails, etc. I will not buy this product again because of this.

eos-eos

Product arrived quickly but arrived expired by one month.

eos-eos

DO NOT BUY! Delivered May 22, 2022 and it expires July 2022?!?! Mid summer - perfect timing for the active ingredients to no longer be effective right? SMH Contacted the company directly (as required by Amazon) with no response over 12 hrs later.

Bought the Weightless body lotion and love the feel on my skin. I bought to use on my arms, neck and ears during the work week. The lotion is very light and feels dry after applying. There is no yucky sunscreen feeling, not oily, not sticky, no shine. I really love the way it feels and the smell isn't too beachy. I've been avoiding sunscreen for years because it makes my skin break out and I generally hate The sticky feeling after applying it. This product is a game changer so far. I will buy the higher SPF version for days when I'll be in the sun.  After using this for a while I tried it as a facial sunscreen and unfortunately I had to wash it off after a few hours. My skin breaks out when I use any moisturizer that contains any chemicals. It becomes itchy, red and irritated. Any SPF chemicals usually make it worse. I use straight hemp oil as a daily moisturizer and then apply my Loreal BB cream and spot concealer. I've been using this basic regiment for years but I've since developed a few minor precancerous areas on my face. I live in the southeast so there is no avoiding the sun. I tried using the Weightless body sunscreen as a face sunscreen and within 3 hours I could feel my skin tightening on my forehead and cheeks. My eyes burned like they do whenever I use commercial sunscreen. I could feel a stinging sensation in my nose. I had to remove it and reapply my trusty hemp oil.  I ordered the face sunscreen hoping it will be formulated differently. As a body sunscreen this is my new go to. As a face sunscreen a big thumbs down, but I'm very sensitive to chemicals on my skin.

goes on smooth and fragrance is not overbearing like some. I use it daily in the summer.
