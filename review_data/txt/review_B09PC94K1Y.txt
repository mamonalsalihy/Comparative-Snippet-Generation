I use cream or lotion sunscreens, but I like to use the spray kind to "top them off" when I'm out of the house. This one by Coppertone works well, but let me say that the spray is very forceful. I was a little taken aback by this. You have to apply fast or you'll get sunscreen pooling on your skin in one area. Scented, but not unpleasant.

This is a very light sunscreen. The mist that comes out is so fine, there is absolutely NO white cast with this lotion. Its more of an oil honestly. I've used it while out in 85-90 degree heat sunbathing, lounging in pool and doing yard work and have yet to get burned. I like the lighter SPF for body I still use a higher SPF for face. This is not at all a lotion or cream when sprayed out. It reminds me of bug spray (without the horrible scent) I've use for pool sessions and seems to stay put, but I don't normally float in the pool longer than an hour so reapplying has never been an issue or necessity for me.

I generally prefer creams instead of sprays, but when I’m going to work on my garden I’m using this spray and is perfect. Is not greasy and it absorbes very fast. It will protect me as of a SPF 15. I’m getting tan, but not burned red. It has an amazing scent. My older son also uses it for his body, he uses a cream for the face. And he loves it, because he doesn’t have to wait and rubber until the cream is absorbed. I have very sensitive skin and it did not make me break. Great pack!!

I’m an avid swimmer, so having a sunscreen that is waterproof is a must. It’s also key that this is a spray. I’m usually by myself when I’m at the pool, so I need to be able to get to those hard to reach places on my back.  I am pretty fair, so I was a little worried about using SPF 15 instead of 30 or 50. However, I haven’t had any problems with it. I typically stay out in the sun for about 2 hours a day, and have not had any burning. I reapply once. I was surprised that this lasted the full 80 minutes even with me going in and out of the water. Would definitely repurchase these. Great price for 3 sprays.

spray on sunscreen is so much easier than the cream kind. This brand is great! it stays on pretty well without making me feel greasy. It has SPF 15, which is kinda low. It also has a light scent.

Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Spray SPF 15, Water Resistant Sunscreen, Broad Spectrum SPF 15 Sunscreen, Bulk Sunscreen Pack, 5.5 Oz Spray, Pack of 3  We’ve used this brand for years for all of our sunscreen needs, but when my husband works outside, he needs one to be waterproof of some kind. I saw this, and he’s been using it for about a week. He says it goes on nice and smooth, and the spray is nice and even. He says it doesn’t feel greasy, which he likes. He also says he doesn’t need to apply it as often, maybe about every couple of hours, and it is working like it should. Highly recommend.

I love Coppertone Sport sunscreens because they stay on longer than many and don't drip painful lotion into my eyes when I sweat. This spray-on version is only SPF 15, so, as a fair person, I can use it in direct sun only for 30-60 minutes of exposure or if I'm outside during an overcast day when, yes, I can still burn. SPF blocks 93% of the sun's rays, which sounds like a lot until you consider that SPF 50 blocks 98% of the rays.  Sprays like this are especially useful if I'm by myself and need to reach difficult places such as my back. For the rest of me, I spray my skin, then rub in for complete coverage. For my face and neck, I spray into my hands, then apply to those areas. You don't want to spray directly on your face when you can inhale it or get it in your eyes.  If you don't have sun-sensitive skin or don't expect to be in direct sunlight for long, then this is a great option for easy application. Just make sure you apply enough of it and reapply throughout the day.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

Since this is only spf 15 it's not great for the start of the summer. But my kids and I tan really fast and it's perfect for summer days once we're past the risk of burning. It sprays easy, and smells like a typical spray sunscreen.

Coppertone sunscreen is my number one choice when it comes to sunscreen product. This coppertone SPF 15, is okay. I mainly use this for light coverage purpose. When I think that I might be expose to the sunlight, but not much. For pool or beach, and out door activities. I don't suggest this one. It is only SPF 15, it is not enough for the coverage on hot summer. Need SPF50 or higher. I tried to avoiding going directly under the sunlight. So this sunscreen served my needs.

Other screens blast out all the suncreen with high pressure. This is nice and even, the spray is a perfect mist. I won't buy others. Use this for working outside and surfing!
