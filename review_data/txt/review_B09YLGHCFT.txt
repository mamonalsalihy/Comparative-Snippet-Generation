I am so glad I found this. As a person of color finding a sunscreen for myself and child has been most difficult. Everything left us grey but this right here is perfect. It feels like a moisturizer and it smells really good only thing I would change is coming in a larger size!

Love it. But just realized could get it a a local store for 1/2 the price.

This product goes clear and does not leave a chalky, white residue on dark skin. Love it!

I would definitely recommend this product. Finally found something that works for meüíú

This is a great sunscreen for black and bon skin totally transparent, easy to apply and not greasy at all!

I subtracted 1 star only because the tube is smaller than I expected. I thought it would be the size of the regular spf 30 but it's much smaller. Other than that I still love the product...matte finish as opposed to the other one which provides a nice glow to the skin. Just depends on what you need from each.

What a disappointment! Drys out sensitive skin, leaving a gray film.

I like the product but am disappointed that the bottle is only half full, maybe 2 oz of product total

When I used it on my son it went on smoothly and didn‚Äôt leave a ridiculous white residue. I will definitely buy again! Finally, a good sunblock for darker skin. Yes!

The sunscreen is thick, absorbs quickly, and leaves no white residue on my dark skin. A dime sized amount is enough to coat my face and neck. Though it has that 'sunscreen smell', it's weak and dissipates quickly. It's free of harmful chemicals found in other sunscreens. The packaging feels sturdy and well-made. Overall, I'm pleased with this sunscreen and will be using it indefinitely; for it's perfectly suitable with my dark, dry skin type.

This sunscreen is my current favorite! My skin is Normal to Dry and its hydrating enough for me to skip using moisturizer in the morning when I go out. Leaves no white cast and preps my skin nicely for makeup. I love that it‚Äôs fragrance free, SPF 50, and water resistant. This is my daily sunscreen and this is my second purchase of it because as soon as I finished my first one I had to restock.
