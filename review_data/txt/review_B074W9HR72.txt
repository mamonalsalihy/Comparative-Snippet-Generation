Didn’t work for multiple people in our group. Reapplied throughout the day and got burnt badly.

I think it’s like any other sunscreen

Put this on my whole family and now we are extremely burnt. Don’t waste your money

I purchased this for my trip to florida, I had a base tan and applied this sunscreen every 25 minutes when I was at the beach. I got the worst sunburn of my entire life and strips of m y skin were white in some parts. I would not recommend buying sunscreen off Amazon and especially this product. I have never been so burnt in my entire life. If I could post the pictures, I would.

Used it on my vacation in Florida. Easy to spray on, good coverage, and no sunburn!

I ordered two of this product and I am sure the product will work fine. The trouble is that I specifically didn't want SPC 50. That is why I ordered 30. One was 30, but the other was 50 and the seller does not take returns.
