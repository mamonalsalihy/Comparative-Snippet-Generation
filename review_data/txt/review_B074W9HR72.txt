I am a scuba diver. I am also a guy and guys don't usually let other guys smear sunscreen on them, and being a bit reserved I am lothe to ask a female that I don't know to do this either. This aerosol spray allows me to get the necessary coverage over my back without having to get someone else to smear it on. If on a moving boat I will move to the stern to apply so that I don't cover everyone else on the boat! Despite many hours in the sun I have never gotten burned or overly tanned while using this product.

Perfect price for a perfect sunscreen. I love this stuff and you can‚Äôt beat this price anywhere. This was the same price for one container at Walgreens. Actually it was 12,93 at Walgreens for one!!! I thoroughly recommend getting it on Amazon. The spray reaches all hard to get areas.

My go to sunscreen. I live by this stuff. Use it right and it will protect you completely. I will ONLY use this stuff in my children and I. Coppertone is the only sunscreen I trust to protect my children. I‚Äôve had to learn this lesson the hard way. Never again will I use another brand. I‚Äôm at a loyal customer.

This is by far the best spray sunscreen (and I‚Äôve tried quite a few). Living in Florida, I‚Äôm covered in sunscreen practically year around. I‚Äôve never had issues with the spray can like some other brands. This has longevity even at the beach.

Bought this two pack for my five day vacation in Cabo San Lucas. I applied sunscreen every day before sitting at the pool and walking the ocean beach. I‚Äôm a fair skinned individual and never got sunburned. I applied another coat of sunscreen after swimming! üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è One can was sufficient for use by one person so I actually had a can in reserve.

This is a product my family has used for years. I like the smell of their other products better, but works great. I have pressure hives so I can‚Äôt just rub anything on my skin. Spraying is easier. I did hear recently that it may not be good for coral reefs. I have not verified this.

I got this for my 2 year old and 3 year old boys who are constantly running around naked in the summer. I tried the baby brand before this and that actually turned me off of spray sun screen but I decided to give this a try and it was soooooo nice!!!! This will be what I buy every summer!! Doesn't get clogged comes out like a spray and is light not sticky.

i run a lot and do long walks, a lot... this stuff is great to spray on and get out the door. good price too.

Other screens blast out all the suncreen with high pressure. This is nice and even, the spray is a perfect mist. I won't buy others. Use this for working outside and surfing!

As far as spray sunscreens go, thos one is my favorite. in general, I still prefer lotion so that I don't end up inhaling all these chemicals when sunscreening my four kids. However, I do like this the best of all the sprays I've tried.

I bought this for my trip to Florida. Worked like it was supposed to.

Easy to apply and lasts a good amount of time before you have to reapply again.

I sprayed my shaved head with this and sat in the sun for 3 hours. I forgot to spray the rest of me with it so I got burnt where I didn't spray but my head didn't get burnt at all. The product works well when you use it correctly.

I have purchased this brand on several occasions over the years in my local drug stores and a few times i went with "off brand" types to see if I was mostly paying for the brand name. It seems to me over all the brand does matter in this case, and I prefer to purchase Coppertone.

Product works great

Fragrance and it does the job

The price was right, and I‚Äôm sure it works great, but with the absence of sunshine in Seattle this past June, I can‚Äôt really give you an honest testimonial. Check back with me in a month.

It did exactly what it said it would‚Ä¶saved me from scorching Vegas sun! The 2 pack was a good deal

Works great. Great price. Compared to target and walmart.

I'm still super pale so this must work pretty well.

This is a repurchase. This stuff works great.

Got a great deal on this sunscreen. Bottle was easy to use and sunscreen lasted through multiple times of getting in the pool and sweating.

Used it on my vacation in Florida. Easy to spray on, good coverage, and no sunburn!

Definitely works and protects you from the sun, but we go through the bottle so fast.

Easy to use

Great value for 2 bottles.

This spray sort of gets everywhere but if you have to put sunscreen on your own back... it's a great option

eos-eos

These are my go-tos for the summer on the beach. The sprays go fast because I think you get more coverage with them so makes since to buy in bulk when possible so I don‚Äôt run out

eos-eos

This was a really good value I will order again

Great protection, water resistant, super easy to apply

COPPERTONE IS THE BEST SUNSCREEN PRODUCT

It's sunscreen. It prevents sunburns.

Love this brand and I'm super fair skinned
