This is the best sunscreen I've ever purchased! Not only does it not leave a white cast (I’m a dark skinned black girl), it makes your skin glow. This stuff is perfection!

I was surprised frankly. I didn't expect much from Paltrow's elitist brain child. But I have a condition that requires sunblock and I walk dogs. I have a dark complexio. And hated that avoiding carcinogens also meant white residue. I was intrigued by the promise of antioxidants and read the reviews. I tell no lie that this is the first time that I've worn a sunblock that the sun didn't get through eventually and I've tried SO many all the way up to 100 sof. I come home with no lines. It is a little oily at first so it's not dry like Neutrogena....it's quite nice. Spend the extra money. In a pinch I even wore it on my face. No issue's at all.

I’ve tried every spf spray there is as this one is definitely my favorite thus far. That said, it lasted maybe 3 or 4 weeks this summer used 1x daily. Maybe was to pick up a couple cans or hit subscribe if you want this to last.

I started using Supergoop!’s Unseen sunscreen about 5 years ago when another mom gave me a sample. I’ve been hooked since because my skin is highly sensitive and it was the only sunscreen and La Roche-Posay’s Anthelios line that have NEVER triggered any allergic flare-ups on me.  Last summer, our kids had swimming lessons 4 days a week for 3 months. Their instructors had a big jug of Supergoop!’s PLAY Everyday Lotion that students may use if they forgot their own. I was skeptical because it was only SPF 50.  The kids ended up loving the sunscreen, too, and even preferred it over other mainstream brands - despite it being something I’d have to rub in on them - because Supergoop! didn’t sting their eyes, it had no fragrance that would irritate our skin, it didn’t feel sticky or heavy, and they never burned.  We recently got back from Maui (Spring Break week) and a few days before our trip, I bought this two pack spray of PLAY Antioxidant Body Mist with Vitamin C, which also was only SPF 50. It arrived within 2 days. My husband is Irish and German - he burns lol and he thought these were overpriced and wouldn’t work on his skin - but it did. He never burned. But we used up the first bottle after 3 days (there are 5 of us). So I bought an extra bottle of sunblock at the ABC Store with slightly higher SPF (Neutrogena Beach Defense SPF 70) and we used that for two days and it was a mistake. I remembered why I don’t buy Neutrogena sunblocks anymore - they don’t work! They sting, they don’t work, we burned (and I’m Filipino!) and our daughter’s arms and shoulders even burned (and she tans, she doesn’t turn red like my husband!) Even my husband had to admit the Neutrogena sunscreen didn’t work and agreed sometimes things cost a little more because they actually work. So for the remainder of our vacation, we used the second bottle of Supergoop! and we’ll never go back to anything else. It’s also more affordable than La Roche-Posay which I use only on my face because they don’t come in bigger bottles.  I wanted to buy the 18oz jug of Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion for our vacation but it wasn’t travel friendly. Anyway, if you’ve never tried Supergoop! and are still debating whether you should, here’s your sign to just go for it. Or get several samples from Nordstrom or Sephora and try it out for at least a week.

Contains hormone disrupter (homosalate)

I purchased this product because I had another smaller bottle and loved that so I wanted to buy the full size. However, I literally only was able to get 5 uses out of this bottle. It doesn’t last, and feels like the bottle was already half empty when I received it! Unfortunately I don’t trust these sellers on amazon and would rather buy from a legit store like Sephora.

I’ve ordered this from QVC and took it to Mexico. Perfect protection. Reordered this year same great quality. I’m a customer for life. I don’t tan I blister. Best product I’ve found.

eos-eos

Easy and clear application. My 8 year old applies without hesitation since it doesn’t leave a residue and doesn’t have any offending smells. Love that it’s reef safe and effective.

I needed a spray sunblock that gets my backside and hard to reach places and will feel sheer. This one is wonderful and doesn't leave an annoying white cast on my car seats. I love supergoop products in general and this one is no exception. The price point is excellent The nozzle sprays well. I tried another high end product and though their product is good -the sprayer was hard to depress and the spray came out more like a stream instead of diffuse to hit a lot of surface area so I like this one alot. Will purchase again.

I absolutely love this stuff & am so grateful I finally found something that: doesn't irritate my skin, is lightweight, doesn't give me a headache with an overbearing scent, is easy to apply, is ocean safe, and most importantly it is the ONLY one I've ever used that I don't end up still getting burnt on my chest despite multiple, timely reapplications. Please do NOT ever change this product! I'm about to order my 3rd bottle and it's an absolute must-have where I live!

We all know we're supposed to wear sunscreen every day but sometimes it feels like a pain. This stuff makes it quick and easy plus it works great and lasts a long time. It also doesn't smell weird, which some sunscreens just do. All in all, this takes all the aggravation out of protecting your skin and that convenience makes it 100% worth it to me.

eos-eos

This stuff is great- it actually really does moisturize and protect. Other spray sunscreen I've tried, the moisturizing and drying basically cancel each other out.  And the scent is not obnoxious.

eos-eos

Love it! Not sticky and actually kept my kids from burning. It is clear. Great product

eos-eos

Fantastic for dark skin… didn’t leave any residue & smells way better than traditional sunscreen. I will continue to use this on myself & my kids sensitive skin.

eos-eos

Really liked the way it easily went on my sensitive skin, without any irritation or white mineral layer.

eos-eos

A good quality sunscreen. Takes 7-10 min. to dry. Using daily (arms, legs, chest and shoulders) lasted10-12 days. Skin never felt dry or "coated". Once dry couldn't feel it.

eos-eos

I received a nearly empty bottle! This product is awesome but I do recommend buying it from supergoop directly to receive a better quality item. I don't understand why this happens to many brands on here?

eos-eos

This stuff goes on with a light mist so it's not cakey & leaves NO residue, which is a big bonus! It is non irritating & doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. All what i wanted/needed to justify the price.

eos-eos

It’s expensive, but feels so much more mild than typical sun screen spray like Neutrogena. Scent is lighter too. Nice ! Worth the splurge.

I love this body sunscreen because it's super-easy to apply (even with the bottle upside down). Gives the body a wonderful glow and can endure water and sweat. Reef safe to protect marine life as well :)

eos-eos

Love this stuff. Easy to apply. Makes your skin look healthy and shiny. Smells like citrus. My favorite. Don’t spray near surfaces that are hard to clean - it can leave an oily film.

eos-eos

I have used this a couple of times. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it. I don’t need to worry about rubbing in all over because the spray really does a good job covering. I also burn often with sunscreen. I had NO burn both times I used this.

Love this sunscreen. It’s pricey but so lightweight and it smells great. My whole family loves this brand now.

Went on smooth and protected my skin from the sun in Hawaii. Loved this product and was safe for the reefs.

I am outside in the hot Arizona sun everyday running and swimming. It helps keep my skin soft and yet protects me from the sun.

I love Supergoop I've been using it for a while now and it never gives me allergic reactions or rashes. This specific one is an oil-based spray so it is slightly oily but it does work. No sunburns for me.

Super Goop sunscreen is the best. This particular spray is easy to apply on your back and shoulders. Works well.

Love this sunscreen spray SO much. My kids do too. Goes on so light, smells great, added vitamin C is awesome for the skin, but a bit pricey
