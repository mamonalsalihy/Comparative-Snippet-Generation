I’m a big hyram fan and after I found out dear clairs and other Korean chemical sunscreen might not be as effective as claimed, I bought this product off of his recommendation. I was a little nervous about a few things. For one I have the worlds Oiliest skin. I felt like dear klairs (my old sunscreen) did leave a bit of shine but it had controlled my oil better than any other sunscreen I tried... until now. This is the closest my skin has ever looked to “normal” as far as oiliness goes so props to that! I also was hesitant on this product because of the tint but also didn’t want a white cast. I would say I’m light to medium with an olive undertone and I think it matches my skin really well! It almost looks like I have makeup on bc my skin tone much more even , but it doesn’t cover breakouts. I happened to have a few pimples (already had them ,not caused by the sunscreen) so you can see that the sunscreen doesn’t cover them completely but blurs/evens out the clear part of my skin. There is a slight white cast but I think the tint offsets it. . I couldn’t speak for other skin tones but I think if you’re light to medium/olive it matches really really well. Finally I love the texture, it’s almost velvety and doesn’t pull on the skin which I hate in a face sunscreen. Not too thick not too watery, and just feels nice to apply. So I don’t really have anything bad to say about this product, but I’ve only had it two days so I’ll have to see if it causes any breakouts ect. But so far I would highly recommend!  Update: I have been using this for well over a year now, and I can never go back to anything else! It doesn't cause breakouts even when I've slept with it on by accident. I use it instead of a primer under my foundation, and it works amazing. I literally have no complaints; I have not gotten a sunburn since I started using this. I just reapply every few hours when I'm at the beach/pool. I love reapplying because it controls my oil and gives that blurred bb cream effect, I'm also able to put it under my eyes/on my eyelids without burning my eyes. I was never someone who got compliments on my skin, but that changed when I started using this along with the rest of my skincare routine (Shoutout Hyram!) I'm so glad I found this product!

Unlike other Sun Bum products, this does NOT smell like bananas. It's so lightweight and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied the lotion and have made it a staple in my daily skin care routine.

My skin is: - Combination (oily T zone, dry cheeks) - Sensitive - Rosacea and Acne prone - Cool/Fair complexion Pros of this sunscreen: - Mattifying - No fragrance - No white cast on my skin tone Cons of this sunscreen: - Too drying to daily use - A tad too orange for my skintone Overall, this is just okay. At first it seemed like it would be a great daily sunscreen, but the more I wore it, the more issues I had with it. It has a thick, mousse texture and a very matte finish thanks to the silicons. If you are starting tretinoin (or any other retinoid/retinol) or just in general have any dry patches, I would not recommend this product for that reason. This sunscreen will cling to those dry patches and leave a splotchy texture. It also just leaves my face looking very flat-no dimension, no glow, all one flat color. I can imagine this product would be good either if you have oily skin normally or for a hot day spent outside since it is waterproof and would keep you from getting greasy. For me (someone who has combination skin and spends most of my time inside), this is much too drying for daily use. The undertone of this sunscreen I suppose would be considered neutral, but on me it is a tad orange. I naturally have a cool undertone and am very fair. In some lights it’s not noticeable, in others it very much is. I’m going to keep this sunscreen for now because I haven’t found a better option and I can see it being handy in some situations.

Works on super pale/porcelain skin tones as well as medium deep skin tones. Dries down to feel like nothing and easy to blend.

eos-eos

Feels, smells and looks like nothing on the skin, just like a primer. I have combo skin and I do not recommend this for people with dry or dehydrated skin, it'll show every single patch.

Wore for a week near the equator, strong sun. I'm pretty fair, ivory tones for foundation. I wore this under foundation as a primer and would reapply over the makeup. Never burnt, never made me look too orange. It is mineral, so not the cleanest/easiest to spread on.

The first day on vaca I only put this on and was outside for 4+ hours and didn't even get a slight tan, even after getting in the water. And i usually burn pretty easily. The next day I sheared it out with coconut oil and got some slight color. So this works really really well. First time I didn't get a burn especially being in Mexico for 5 days outside the whole time. Really like that this is safe or safer to go into the ocean with, that's the reason I bought it.

Sun Bum's Mineral Tinted Sunscreen SPF 30, first and foremost, provides excellent protection from the elements of the sun! It's even water resistant! In addition, it provides that protection while leaving my skin looking great. Thanks to the lovely tinted formula that helps even my skin tone and subtly blurs imperfections, I can enjoy this formula alone on a 'no makeup look' day as well. This formula is super light and creamy in texture. It's very similar to an airy, mousse like effect, which also allows this sunscreen to apply & absorb into the skin like a dream. It doesn't leave behind any white cast, it's truly unscented, and works amazingly well by itself or with makeup. It provides a soft and subtle, matte canvas that is remarkably easy to work with. Lastly, I love that this sunscreen is formulated with skin loving ingredients and that they left the bad stuff out making this my perfect defense against UVA/UVB Rays!! Needless to say, I 'TRUST THE BUM'!!

I originally liked the spreadability and thought the sunscreen has a nice color, but be ware if you have dry patches in your skin, this sunscreens will show it off like it’s no body’s business. I was using my retinoids during that time so the patches on my cheeks looked so bad with this sunscreens TT I wanted to like it, but so far the best feel and cosmetic appearance sunscreen is still elta MD uh elements tinted sunscreen.

I’m shocked at how much I like this. I’ve been using the Australian Gold Tinted sunscreen and while it was nice, it dried down a little too matte for my preference. I gave this a shot because I had heard a few good reviews. This feels so light and whipped almost. Wearing it now and it feels like I’m not wearing anything. There’s a very light banana scent but not enough to irritate my super sensitive eczema-prone skin which is a HUGE plus. The tint is barely there and really just serves to reduce white cast. Some tinted sunscreens have a very warm undertone and look orange on the skin, but this one is more neutral. Only things I don’t love is the size. I feel like for almost $20 you should be getting more product. Also, I do have concerns about coverage but I think it’s just because I can’t feel it on my skin. I’m doing two light coats in hopes I get even coverage. I hope they come out with an SPF 50 version soon!  If you’re on the fence, just buy it. It feels amazing.  UPDATE: well... maybe it’s not that great lol. Used it every day and I am so dang burnt. Maybe it feels like there’s nothing on my skin because there ISNT anything on my skin. I’m super pale though, so this may be better for those who don’t burn extra easily. I’d recommend two thin coats rather than just one thick coat.

I absolutely love this sunscreen. I used to buy Blue Lizzard sunscreens and liked them enough for protection and scent, but this sunscreen feels like melted butter.  I am rather pale, so I was hesitant about getting a tinted sunscreen. However, I thought it could maybe replace my sunscreen + foundation --> and use one product instead -> a tinted sunscreen. And I am so glad I did. I actually use it all the time now.  Even though the summer is over, I still use it every day instead of cream and foundation b/u I love how it feels. I tried to find a cream that has that sheerness, but so far, no success there. The only thing is that the tube gets super messy and squirts.

This is my favorite daily sunscreen. The texture is amazing, and glides on. I have sensitive skin and usually break out often, but have not had any issues with this. I even accidentally slept in it, and had no break outs the next day. The sunscreen almost feels like a primer - and has a matte finish. My skin did not get oily through the day as it usually does. I have tried both the tinted and non-tinted, and honestly both are great. The tinted is nice because it actually acts as a foundation for me. The “white cast” doesn’t show up at all with the tinted. With the non-tinted, the white cast is present at first, but quickly disappears after working it in, maybe 30 seconds. I have light, Irish skin, so results for darker skin may be different. This is my favorite daily facial sunscreen. Copper tone pure is a close second.

I have sort of olive-toned, acne-prone skin, and so far sun bum has not disappointed!  I like that this product is tinted, although I don’t notice too much of a difference in uneven skin tone. But, it definitely does not leave a white “sheen” like some mineral sunscreens do. It feels kind of buttery and pleasant to apply.  It is mattefying, which is AWESOME! I usually have a bit of a shine to my face, and this definitely helps my skin appear more “velvety” and less oily.  I use about a pea-sized amount every morning, and it seems like enough to cover my face and neck- I’m interested to see how long the bottle will last me.  My only complaint is that they don’t make this tinted product in SPF 50.

eos-eos

This sunscreen has the texture of whipped butter/mousse and is very light feeling on the skin. It doesn't make my skin shiny or oily and dries down to a powdery finish. It isn't completely matte but not dewy either. The color is a perfect match for my very fair complexion. I don't know how it would work out for darker tone and/or drier skin types, but it's fantastic for my combination skin type. It doesn't irritate my rosacea at all, which is a huge bonus as sunscreen tends to trigger flushing on my cheeks.

I got this after Hyram recommended it on YouTube— he was spot on! I have super oily skin and sunscreen can easily turn me into a greaseball or break me out but not this. This feels very lightweight, similar to a makeup primer because of the dimethicone and keeps me from being greasy and stays pretty matte without being drying. I think this would be a good option for using over makeup to reapply sunscreen throughout the day also. It’s a mineral sunscreen so it isn’t irritating around the eyes and has a very subtle tint to mask any white cast. I think a lot of people see tint on sunscreen labels and think it’s makeup but it’s just to help with the white cast. I am fair skinned but I think this would work on a variety of complexions. Good job Sun Bum and thank you Hyram!

I am an extremely fair complexion person. Like you can't tell the difference between my white socks and my legs. When I burn there is no "just a little pink" with me. I turn purple and I am miserable for a week. Recently my family and I went to our local amusement park and being so warm in our area I wore shorts. We were out in the sun for 5+ hours, I was reapplying the sunscreen every hour to hour and a half and did not burn at all!!! I have tried almost every type of sunscreen out there and this is the only one that worked for me. The only downside I found was after a few layers, I started getting a "powdery" look on my skin

eos-eos

When they say this stuff goes on like butter, they mean it literally feels like putting melted butter on your face. After a few minutes, it dries into a nice, matte finish. It's definitely waterproof, as I just had myself a good cry and it didn't come off at all. It's also not too dark for my extremely fair skin, despite being tinted.  10/10 will be buying again.

This is definitely the Best physical sunscreen I've ever used. Glides on like whipped cream, easy to work in until sheer with only the slightest hint of a white cast that you have to look for to notice.  This is much nicer than their Body version, which has fragrance and isn't as smooth to apply, so I stocked up on this one.  Doesn't feel slimy or tacky like most sunscreen, and Zero bug-attracting scent. In fact, I apply lavender lotion on top of SunBum to repel fleas and most flying pests (Avalon organics ~$8 here on Amazon).  Win-Win!

eos-eos

After buying my first tube I was mildly impressed with how good it felt on my skin but I thought the tint was too light for my skin tone & I made a mental note to try a different product with a darker tint. Then the compliments started. I am 71 years old, and I have a 71 year old face. But while wearing this sunscreen -with no makeup - I started getting casual comments about how good my skin looked. Hmmm, I thought. Maybe the tint isn’t too light. I ordered another tube and this is the only thing I wear on my face every day, even when I’m not going outside. Try it.

eos-eos

I am now on my third bottle and can't get enough. This has actually helped my skin so much that now I can use this instead of foundation every day. Still works great under foundation, but I have found myself using this every day and easily skipping my foundation. Coverage is great, no strong scent which I personally love. I have sensitive, acne-prone, eczema skin and this doesn't cause flare-ups or anything! Great for every day or even beach trips. Worked like a miracle on our trip to Mexico, I was even sharing it at the pool. 10/10

eos-eos

I wear sunscreen every day, even in rainy Seattle. I prefer physical blockers in my sunscreens, so I really appreciate Sunbum's formulation. The tint is perfect for masking the white chalkiness that is apparent with many physical sunscreens, it also has a slightly mattifying effect, enough that I don't feel the need to wear any foundation or concealer with it. The texture is great also, it has great slip. No scent that I can detect either, which is a plus. It offers all these benefits at a better price than other similar formulations.

eos-eos

Somehow I suddenly became allergic to chemical sunscreens one day and needed to switch to mineral sunscreens because I take daily SPF wear seriously. Everything left a terrible white cast or pilled on top of my skincare/under my makeup. Then I tried this and I’ve never looked back. I would cry if they stopped making it. I do have to skip my face oil before putting this on, and only use certain foundation formulas so it doesn’t “pill”, but the tint makes it so that I don’t need to wear much makeup anyway. I got the baby SPF 50 stick from the same company to keep in my purse for touch ups. Love love love!!

eos-eos

I’m a fan. I play beach volleyball in Florida and my dermatologist isn’t happy that I was reluctant to wear sunscreen on my face. The other zinc based sunscreens make me look pale, pasty, and half dead. Others are difficult to rub in and don’t feel like they go on evenly. This product is amazing. I use tinted and it goes on like silk. This is my go to sunscreen now...oh, and it’s reef safe.

eos-eos

Update: WOW. I have combo skin but where it’s oily, it’s super oily. Never found a product that works. I used it as a moisturizer and primer under makeup today. At 7:45 pm with no touch ups today, my skin has never looked better. Yes my face is oily after all day, but not bad at all. I don’t write a lot of reviews but this stuff is amazing 😍  Had a delivery issue, not sure if that’s the seller or carrier (USPS I think), but tracking said it was delivered on the expected date, and it was not. Had to wait 15 days to file a claim, then it showed up about 10 days later.  The product itself is great. Feels very smooth, and matte. Almost like a thick makeup primer. Need to blend it in but it goes on nicely. I got it and brought it with me to Arizona. Used in the sun for two days straight. Protection seems good, and my normally very oily skin looks better than with anything I’ve used before, even after being out in the sun all day. Makes my skin feel nice too. Not as tinted as I hoped, definitely not like a B.B. cream. It really is a primer. Good alone for a day at the pool or just outside in the summer, going to test it as a primer too. I put a little foundation over it yesterday and it blended well.

eos-eos

Because it said it was tinted I thought it would be a good replacement for bringing my cc cream. I went to Peru and hiked the Inca trail to Machu Picchu and didn’t want to have to bring make up. The sunscreen is fabulous it goes on so well and is so light feeling, and is great for going underneath make up. But if you’re getting it because it’s tinted hoping it could replace foundation or CC creams it doesn’t really work for that unless you have blemish free skin ha ha. But I do love it and I use it almost every day.

I purchased the push/ up stick at my local surf shop for surfing. Wow! I used it all day out of the water and I really liked it. So… I went on Amazon to purchased the tinted lip balm, and tinted face sunscreen too. No white residue from any of these products and the consistency of the sunscreen is super creamy and not cakie at all! No eye stinging torture. I’m definitely recommending the entire line! Plus reef safe. I wear them daily out of the water because I live in Hawaii where it’s sunny

Due to having sensitive skin I find I can only use mineral sunscreens, however pretty much all of the ones sold in stores aren't tinted and therefore go on extremely white (I'm fairly pale but it makes even me look like a ghost). When I saw Sunbum offered a tinted version, I ordered it immediately. It doesn't offer much in terms of coverage, but I'm just happy that it matches my skin tone when applied. Definitely remember to shake it well before application, the times I didn't it came out separated. It takes a few minutes to go from a creamy feeling on the skin to drying down to a matte finish. I recommend using a lightweight moisturizer beforehand as I find it slightly drying. I wish more stores would carry this tinted version, but in the meantime it's good to know I can order it.

eos-eos

This is the closest thing I could find after Coola discontinued their Daydream primer spf. I have super sensitive, acne prone skin and this priming spf does not cause any issues for me. I am pale, so the non-tinted version works well for me and blends well, however the tinted version would be better suited for darker skin tones. I have purchased many times, and hope they never stop making this!

I tend not to wear as much makeup when the weather gets hotter, so I opt to use tinted sunscreen. This one is not too dark and not greasy and there is no overpowering scent at all. I really love how smoothly it goes on my face! When I do wear foundation, I do not put any under my eyes (as women get older, using concealer under the eyes is not flattering), so I tend to put some of this under my eyes instead. I really, really love this product and so happy I finally found one I love and what the company does with some of the proceeds is amazing. Happy to support a company that gives back!

This product is exactly what I was looking for - if you have clear skin, you can literally use this in replacement to your foundation. I haven't worn foundation in years & have been on the search for a product like this + that matches my weird skin tone & this is it! Coverage is minimal but enough to cover any redness and evens the skin tone out lovely. I am always complimented when I wear it. Who doesn't like some coverage + SPF??!  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS PRODUCT!!! I love that the tint isn't orange or dark tinted at alll, it literally blends perfectly into the skin.  The product I received has an expiration date of 2023 - FYI.

This product is extremely easy to blend giving a blurred effect to minor imperfections like larger pores. However, you can not overuse it or it will come out blotchy on dry skin. I have an alabaster tone and this blends nicely. No orange dry down or “off color” to my light skin. It feels like a nice moisturizer, not grease or oily as some can be. I’ve worn it while having a (covid) mask with hardy any transfer. I’ve come back to buy the non-tinted so I can use it as general moisturizer when not going out for errands. I have combination skin.

Finally I've found a sunscreen I love for many reasons. It has a beautiful cool beige color, it isn't gunky (it's very smooth and soft), it has no scent, and, it doesn't irritate my eyes! Hallelujah!!! I love it and I will continue to buy it. I've been using it for over a month. Try it. I decided to buy it because of the picture of a young lady with dark hair in the reviews. She has a cool complexion and it looked good. This sunscreen is fantastic!!!

I was on the hunt for a pregnancy safe face sunscreen and I’m so happy I found this! I love Sun Bum products but my favorite delicious smelling sunscreen is sadly not pregnancy safe :/ so I was excited to try the Sun Bum Mineral line. I love how smooth and soft it feels on my face. It says tinted but honestly I don’t notice much color from it (which is great because other tinted SPF products turn me orange and/or leave patches on my skin). This is perfect and I’m happy to have found this product for spring and summer before my little one arrives!

eos-eos

So I have purchased this product several times. The tint looks natural and it has a beautiful velvety finish. I don’t even even have to put powder on because its not shiny. It takes the place of makeup for work days. This, lip balm, and mascara and I am done! Problem is I am in my 40s and i really feel like spf 30 is not enough! I keep straying to other spf 50 products but they are always greasy and heavy and so I end up coming back to this product! Sun Bum Please make this tinted sunscreen in spf 50!!!

I've been using this as my every day sunscreen for about a month. It blends in perfectly with my pale skin even though the product itself looks pretty dark. Much better than an untinted sunscreen, seems to protect my skin properly. It's almost like wearing a super light coverage foundation, which I love. It doesn't look like makeup on my skin but does even out my tone!

eos-eos

Super lightweight, no white cast, doesn't even rub off onto any clothing. I love the blurring effect it gives (it makes my bare skin look amazing), and I can even wear it under foundation. I use it mainly for my face and neck! (I have light/neutral/beige skin tone). It doesn't feel oily, it melts into my skin and leaves a smooth, velvety feel.  I can finally stop struggling with my Neutrogena sunscreen that gave horrible white cast and got all over my clothes.

I love this product for my skin.  Took it to FL for vacation after being pastey white all winter up North. It did an A+ job at keeping me from burning while out at Disney and Universal in 95*F days of full sun and not a cloud in sight.  I will absolutely be buying this again. I didn't break out, it didn't feel heavy once I put it on and it smelled nice. I really couldn't ask for more from a sun screen product.

eos-eos

Became my favorite sun protection for face. It’s so easy to apply and for this reason doesn’t leave white streaks. It makes the skin tone lighter but it is normal in case of products that are mineral based. It is a small price I am happy to pay for a more safe sun protection compared to those made with harmful chemicals.

eos-eos

Love this stuff. It has such a dry, soft, easy to apply texture. Never really felt anything like it. Does not show any white like most natural zinc sunscreens. On my white freckled skin tone it doesn't show at all. It separates in the bottle so you have to shake and knead. No biggie. Understood for natural products. Only 30 min protection apparently.

I am shockingly pale (even with a spray tan- it just diffuses the glare) and so sun protection while outside for hours is a priority. This sunscreen feels very light and feathery upon application, gives excellent sun protection and did not irritate the skin on my face. The only downside is that it does leave a very faint pale tint to your face. Worth it though.

This tinted sunscreen feels amazing when applied, has a pleasent smell, and works as a base layer for my makeup. So happy with it, will buy again.

It goes on so smooth and is very easy to apply. My 9 year old son was amazed at how good it feels on his skin. It smells really good but the scent is subtle. The tint in it matches my competition and prevents my skin from looking washed out white. I am allergic to pretty much all regular sunscreens and wanted something different. So glad I tried it. It is fabulous and I won’t be using anything else!!

Love this product it’s not greasy or has any gross sunscreen smell. It makes my face soft, applies evenly, and smoothly giving my face a bit of an air brushed look. On my fourth tube over the last two years. Seems to last a long time I only get a new tube about every five months. Also takes the place of my foundation so I only need this product not sunscreen and foundation. Would recommend 💯

eos-eos

I wear it as my 'foundation'. It is like silk on the face. I wish it DID smell like bananas - it really has no smell. I have very pale skin and haven't had any problems with the color - it just kind of melts into the skin. It does get runny, but I store it upside down (pointy side down, lid up in the air) which solves the runny problem but leaves the container useless to stand on its own.

I really like how the product feels and looks on my face. I can put some on to go out and not worry about other makeup and my face getting too much sun. Also, I have lots of allergies and I had no reactions to this vegan product. Definitely will buy again.

This product is a combination of a primer, sunscreen and a foundation (due to the lightly pigmented tint) for me. It's a 3 in 1. I dont need the coverage of a foundation, but if you do, then you will want to use a foundation in addition to this product. It leaves my skin with a mat finished as opposed to the normal shiny finish of a sunscreen. This product is probably meant to be usef as an every day product and not for the beach or hours at the pool. In that instance, you will want a more intense sunscreen and need to reapply throughout the day. I use many of the SunBum sunscreen products and love them all! This product is not easy to find in store.

I’m Hispanic with light brown skin and really love how this sunscreen works for me! It blends in with my skin tone nicely, is very lightweight, and not greasy at all! It also works really well under makeup. I would say that my skin is “normal” - maybe a little oily in the T zone - and while this sunscreen is very comfortable on me, I could see it be drying or have the potential to show dry patches if that’s a concern for you. Overall, I’m really happy I found this and now it is my new daily sunscreen!

I have eye allergies, so if I choose wrong sunblock, my eyes would burn and itch. My son got severe sunburn on his face, so I switched to Sun Bum, the original face sunblock on my son and sun block spray (70 spf) for beach days, and they have worked really great, and we also love cool down lotion. So I said why not try one for myself? This tinted sunblock goes on very smoothly and I feel like I didn’t put it on. It is very light. The shade looked a little darker for me (I have pale skin) but once I smear on, it matched my color tone. No eye burning! It smells really good too.

I love this stuff !!! The only sunscreen/cream that has worked and not clogged my pores. I burned my face from 1 day of working on my property at 94 degrees. Got this and have been working outside for a week in 85 to 95 degree weather and NO burn at all. The tint is great and feels great to the touch too. To whoever created this, thank you for literally saving my skin💗💗💗

(From John’s daughter) this is PERFECT!!! Everything I’ve been wanting. I don’t like heavy foundation on my face but I still need some coverage. I saw good reviews on TikTok so I tried it. It goes on a little pasty but the tone evens out beautifully. It has the look of traditional foundation but it is so light and airy that I forget it’s there. I also haven’t had a lot of transfer on my masks either.
