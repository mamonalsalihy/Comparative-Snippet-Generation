I’ve heard great reviews about this sunscreen, and was so excited to try it. However unfortunately it does not work for my darker skin tone. It leaves a white, and blue cast that does not go away. I look casket ready when I apply this. NOT CUTE! Also the formula was very drying. I have oily skin and it was waaaay to dry for me. I would not recommend for darker skin tones!!!! At such a high price point for spf I would expect better.

If shaken very well is product is almost cast-less and absorbs into the skin within a few minutes. I reapply sunscreen 3 times daily and this works well without getting gross on your face. I also have the tinted version but bought this because the tinted is T2O only and that isn't enough UVA protect for me. My skin type is EXTREMELY sensitive, oily with dry patches and I have rosacea if that gives you an idea. I am on a quest for the best sunscreen in the world that I can reapply several times a day without hating it. Personally I apply this one first and then the tinted to remove any potential for cast if not rubbed in. Throughout the day I reapply both mixed together and it holds up really well for me. I will continue to buy even though it is a bit pricey for the amount you get.....at least until an even better one is discovered;)

This is a great product, but the order said it was a three pack and only one bottle was delivered. Beware.

I tried the white first and liked the consistency but it really washed my face out and I found that I was putting on makeup just to cover the sunscreen so I purchased the tinted and AM IN LOVE!!!! Personally, I love ultra thin/barely there makeup in the summer. I don't want to cover or conceal my skin, just protect it and perfect my actual skin. I love this product for that exact thing. The tint is very natural looking and makes my skin look glowy and healthy but literally doesn't look like anything is on my skin...it's amazing! I also feel fully protected which is the goal. I get excited about using this product every day rather than dreading putting spf on which has always been the case. It is light weight and extremely comfortable to wear. I don't have that "I need to wash my face asap" feeling that every other product gives me. I also think the tinted version would be great for people who still want more coverage out of makeup because you could appply this first and then a light application of regular makeup would conceal anything that needs to be covered. Such a great purchase and I will continue to buy!

Very light weight texture, I wanted a mineral based sunscreen and this brand was recommended in Consumer Reports as being effective and the SPF is accurate on the bottle. Many sunscreens they tested don't actually measure up to the SPF they claim to have. It's a little white at first but after rubbing it in lightly, it's undetectable. Not greasy and doesn't clog pores.

This is the only one of the La Roche-Posay Anthelios line I like -- the other ones I see, seem to have chemicals in them that cause a burning feeling (and unsunburn related redness) in my face. This is also true of many expensive face sunscreens carried by estheticians, Dermstore and the like. (I have sensitive skin so could just be me -- I have shocked estheticians with my comments about sunscreen products they have sold me that give me a burning sensation (and related redness that goes away), particularly if wearing in the hot sun, despite being described as for sensitive skin)  You need to put it on over a moisturizer to keep the sun tan lotion from getting into your pores and a light amount of the sunscreen works best because it does have a white color to it. It's better than the tinted version which always seems to come off on my clothes (or blazers of male relatives and friends I hugged in the old, pre-COVID19 days).  Minerals make it drying UNLESS you put it on over your moisturizer.

I love the other products they make. I had the none mineral suncreen, just like this, and I still love it, but I wanted one I can use around my extremely sensitive eyes. I am impressed as my eyes are not effected in the least. It's wonderous. I also like this mineral one because when I'm using retinol, or glycolic acid this product doesn't sting at all. I'm very pleased. Definitely a great sunscreen for sensitive eyes and skin. I always wear sunscreen so I am not covered in freckles. I am always looking for the best. I think I can stop looking.

My husband has sensitive skin that is prone to break outs in the Summer. I really wanted to invest in a good sunscreen for him because it's hard to find a reliable mineral sunscreen out there that doesn't irritate sensitive skin. He told me that he loves this sunscreen and that it doesn't leave white marks on his face.. nor does it break him out. Well done, La roche posay, well done. Husband has approved!

eos-eos

My work gives me a lot of direct sun exposure. I need a sunscreen that is long lasting and non-greasy. This product meets both requirements. The mineral in this product ensures that I'll have protection long into the day and it is quickly absorbed on application leaving a light powdery finish. I use this product religiously and believe that it is well worth the price. My dermatologist has even commented on the lessening of sun damage that he's seeing.

eos-eos

So easy to spread, so thin, like regular lite moisturizer and yet.. titanium sunscreen!! My dermatologist recommended this and altho it was expensive, it was literally worth every penny. Doesn’t sweat off into your eyes. Doesn’t make your face look shiny. Didn't cause a breakout. Total win.

eos-eos

I got a recommendation for this facial sunscreen. Most of all, I like how easy to blend this lotion in. I wasn’t really aware that this was also a moisturizer but since I use moisturizer anyway, I’m not sure if this aspect matters as much. It’s an effective sunscreen. I’m out walking the dog often, and tend to burn easily. So far none of that this season.

eos-eos

This is very light on my skin. I like the bottle design and how I can extract just a bit by pouring it. No waste. would buy it again.

eos-eos

La- Roche Posay Anthelios is my absolute favorite lightweight, mineral Sunscreen. It's easy to apply, gives me great sun protection from sunburn and I apply a dime size amount over my moisturizer on my face and neck. I will never use chemical sunscreens again after researching them extensively. There has been more skin cancer at institutions like The Mayo Clinic using popular products made with chemical ingredients. They may be less expensive,, but only in the short run.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen because it is easily applied where some mineral sunscreens are too thick. This is more a liquid form.No white cast .The container is the perfect size to carry in your purse. will purchase again and again

I have been using LaRoche Posay Anthelious Mineral sun screen ever since my dermatologist recommended it about five years ago. This is the first sunscreen that is not greasy or oily looking and doesn't make my face break out. There is no fragrance which I appreciate. The only negative is that the zinc sticks in the pores on my face and I really have to scrub. If you have small pores, not to worry.

eos-eos

Love this stuff. Doesn't cause acne. I used to use the tinted one but it kept getting stains on my clothes and bathing suits. This one is better. Also it looks like a small bottle but it will last you a whole year easily.

eos-eos

My dermatologist friend recommended it for me. It is very light. The best way to use is, put it directly over skin before everything else, put it on everyday, sunny or cloudy.

eos-eos

Excellent product but the seller is not.

Tried this sunscreen when I was a kid (18) and LOVED it. I am now 32 and try to apply sunscreen everyday. This one is so smooth and doesn't leave any white residue like my CeraVe one does. It's also a nice smooth base to apply makeup to if necessary.

eos-eos

It leave a layer of white cast might not be the case for everyone. I fall under colored skin category so it has that long lasting white cast which stays on till I wash my face twice. But is a good spf as it has minerals which sticks to skin for long time

eos-eos

Goes on smooth, works well. Sometimes I set with powder if I'm not using makeup over because it is shiny/dewey on me.

eos-eos

This is not a moisturizing product, which is great is you have sensitive skin or sunscreens make you breakout. It’s very lightweight and the minerals sit in top of the screen. It makes my skin look airbrushed

eos-eos

The best sunscreen for facial application! No white cast. No greasy feeling. Leaves skin prepped and ready for primer and foundation.

eos-eos

This product I purchased through Amazon has a gritty consistency and left a white haze on the skin when applied. It almost feels like a scrub on my skin. The exp. date indicate 07/2019. I bought another bottle at a local drugstore to compare. The product sold at the drugstore was smooth, felt nice on the skin and did not leave a white haze. I wonder if this product sold by Amazon is not from La Roche-Posay as advertised. Unfortunately, I am passed the return window otherwise I would have returned it.

I am extremely fair and need this reliable mineral sunscreen. Works very well, I can wear with my full foundation and eye makeup (doesn't peel and flake off unlike the other brands). Not greasy, or heavy, just a little whitish residue but very minimal (zinc and titanium are the best coverage). No fragrance is a plus! You will still need to reapply, which is easy to do without ruining your makeup.

eos-eos

Very easy to use, drys quickly, doesn't feel oily once applied. Good sun protection.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is thin spreads nicely and it’s perfect to wear under your make up. Although I think it’s too pricey, until I can find something comparable I will continue to use it

eos-eos

Goes on nicely under makeup or without makeup. Put on at 9:00 am, full sunny day (90 degrees) and out of sun by 5:00. No burn, did not sweat off

eos-eos

My husband uses this as his doctor recommended sunscreen whenever he’s outside. It seems to go on clear and he has no complaints. I wanted to find one that is safe and I’m satisfied that this is. It’s pricy but.....

I have loved other La Roche products, and this is a first time trying out the mineral sunscreen. I previously used the old Eucerin formula SPF 30 in the peach and white container. My skin is sensitive, and this product worked great. No greasy feeling, no white cast, just protection. I did not use it over a moisturizer, just used a small bit of the product, then a dusting of my mineral powder make up. Good size for getting through TSA also. The price was very good, less than Target locally.

I love this mineral sunscreen from La Roshe-Posay. This is very lightweight and easy to spread on the face. Plus doesn’t have noticeable cast !

eos-eos

I have cancer on my face so my dermatologist suggest this product and I love it. It is a little bottle but it goes a long way. When I sweet, it stays put on my face. It does not feel heavy, it feels great. You want to apply it daily even if there is no sun. I have very sensitive skin and I love it

eos-eos

This is my go-to face sunscreen. It is very light and soaks in without being oily. It seems to have very good coverage.

eos-eos

Love it. As a base, perhaps it's a tiny bit drying for older or drier skin complexions - but I use another more moisturising sun protector over this one to remedy any drying effects. I think you could also use a serum under it to create more moisture. Great that this product uses NO chemical (sun blocks) and doesn't leave the skin oily looking. Perfect for hot and humid climates

Very good face sunscreen

This is my absolute favorite face sunscreen. I live in Florida and take frequent trips to the beach and pool. After many hours in the sun, my face has not had ANY redness or irritation!

eos-eos

This is a very good sunscreen BUT I would not recommend it to people with a darker skin.

I suffer from sensitive skin on my face and have been diagnosed with slight rosacea on my cheeks. I have tried numerous different kinds of sunscreen with different ingredients. Just returned from an 11 day motorcycle trip and was in the sun 6 to 8 hours a day. I applied it as suggested (every 2 hours) this product worked great, never irritated my skin or got sunburned. Slightly white tint when applied but rubs in hardly noticeable. Will use this from now on. Very happy with this product!

eos-eos

Easy to absorb and does the job without affecting your skin

eos-eos

This stuff is great! It's a mineral sunscreen so once it goes on, it feels very matte. It doesn't seem like it will feel matte because it's very thin and watery but it is matte within a few seconds! It works awesome and is very light. I will pay the money and continue to wear this. I even layer it under my makeup and it doesn't feel heavy, greasy or cakey!

eos-eos

Love how easy this goes on without being cakey or too tinted

First bottle of this I got was very gritty and not very fun to rub into my face. I didn’t know that wasn’t how it was supposed to be and suffered through most of a bottle before it occurred to me to check if others were having the same experience. Turns out it should be very smooth. I purchased a second one and am very pleased. As anyone looking for mineral sunscreen knows, it isn’t easy to find one that goes on easy and doesn’t leave you looking like a ghost. I use this on my face and top it with a very light dusting of lightly tinted powder to bring down the sheen. It can be a bit drying and so I’ve had to moisturize a bit more. Small price to pay for a reliable daily sunscreen without the chemical sunblocks.

One of my favorite sunscreens for my face. Nice matte finish. A little bit of a white cast, but not very noticeable.

This is ultra thin and very good sun protection awesome product.

My dermatologist recommended this, and though I hesitated because it's more expensive, it is completely worth it-- and the bottle lasts forever.  I've developed contact dermatitis for just about every sunscreen I've tried. Most mineral suncreens go on white and feel oily or cakey. This rubs in invisibly, and feels great on the skin. I think a bottle lasts me at least a year, wearing it every day. It's never let me down, even swimming. Many times I've gone to the beach with a heavy-duty mineral sunscreen on my body and this on my face. Even with re-application on the body after being in the water, somehow I never get burned on my face even when I get sunburned on my body. This is really great stuff.

eos-eos

Melts into skin right away! Also doesn't leave a chalky cast. The volume made me think I could only use this sparingly, but it turns out you don't need as much as the regular sunscreens out there so this lasts a while.

eos-eos

Used this when I went to the beach. No sun burn, no significant tanlines around my sunglasses, mattifying, and minimal whitecasr.

eos-eos

I love it! It is a light sunscreen in terms of texture which is absolutely perfect for the face. It doesn't feel thick AT ALL! It is also almost an entirely matte when you apply it on your face which is why I wouldn't say it's too moisturizing.

Es ligero al aplicar, la piel se siente humectada y permite el maquillaje.

Easy to spread and is a broad spectrum sun block with key minerals.
