The wife likes the smell of this out of any of the sunscreens. So, I do what she says so I see another day.  Joking aside, I like the smell as well. As it nears summer time, it makes you feel all happy inside! Also, it makes you look forward to the beach!  My stores have recently stopped selling the SPF 15 so I'm glad to find it on Amazon for a good price.  The sunscreen rubs in easily and lasts for a solid two hours - even if you go for a swim. At SPF 15, however, I wouldn't wait too much longer to apply some more. I haven't gotten burnt at all this summer, so I'm happy! The lower SPF also helps to get a decent tan with less chance of getting tons of sun rays. The product doesn't feel slimy either. If I apply near sand, I'll give it a couple minutes before getting any sand on my body. That way, the sand doesn't stick to you!  I've always been happy with this product and will continue to use it as long as it's available.

Maybe I just didn’t look long or hard enough, but I couldn’t find any place near the place I was staying in Florida’s gulf coast that sold suntan lotion. Plenty of sunscreen everywhere, but I wanted a bit of tan along with my sun protection.  Ordered this from Amazon and it’s perfect! I use it for the first hour or so I’m out in the sun, then switch to 30 SPF for the remainder of the day. By the end of my stay I have a decent tan and no burn. Win.

The sun screen is good but the customer service is fantastic! I’m going on vacation on Friday. Bottle arrived broken on Tuesday night. I reached out to the distributor and a new one arrived Thursday morning. Great experience and I will definitely buy from them again.

This sunblock is great because it provides protection from not only UVA but UVB rays, which I read a while back is incredibly important. I used it every day during a recent trip to Maui but will also be using it extensively where I live in the CA desert to protect myself during the summer and while sun tanning. Excellent product!

best sunscreen I've ever owned. UNBELIEVABLE.. I wear it all the time doing whatever and it lasts. I worked in the caribbean for three years, and started traveling everywhere with it. Swimming. scuba diving, Hiking in Thailand.... I even wore it in the desert for 6 days straight in namibia. As a guy, my skin never absorbs sunscreen, and I hate putting it on. But with Hawaiian tropic, extreme sport, it goes right on. No oily mess. Smells great. Lasts hours. my wife was so blown away, she ditched all the stuff she uses, and we now just use this. I even use it on my face. I'd recommend it over everything i've ever tried. much better than spray, aerosols, or other lotions.

the scent is pure beach, its great. stays on for a long time even when swimming. is very effective and works- I will never use anything else, I trust it every time I go in the sun. I use 15 SPF, and have never got burned and I spend a lot of time in the sun. I do re-apply every 2 hours if it is really hot/sweaty or I am catching waves. I am on automatic order for this one for now, unless I find a better buy on the shelf!

I was dragged to the beach for a family function and thought what better way to work on my tan? Five hours and a reapplication later I apparently missed a spot, not having spread the sunscreen all the way. I now have the most interesting cloud shaped tan pattern on my arm. The skin under the sunscreen application got a nice shade or two darker with no burns, while the other skin that BURNED got about five shades darker. This sunscreen/tanning lotion is awesome, just make sure to apply evenly and everywhere!

People look down on SPF 15 lotions so there seems to be a lot less variety than at the higher strengths. I like 15 - if I'm just going to be in the sun for a little while I just don't want to slather up with the thick stuff, and it seems to keep me from getting burned. This is my favorite - it's light and smooth, and smells fine. The bottles are great because they stand upside down so the contents are always gathered at the opening. The cap is tight enough that I've never gotten a leak. I've used it for the last two years and I wouldn't go to the beach without it.

My Husband will only use this sunscreen. He will breakout from anything higher than SPF15 and never burns. Non greasy and has a lighter fragrance.

Sometimes I want a lighter sunscreen and this is perfect. It's easy to apply and drys pretty fast.  This stuff smells great too.

Daily moisturizer we use every morning after our shower

It works well against su burn when used as directed and the " sunscreen" smell is not too strong... it has a subtle tropical scent.

eos-eos

Favorite scent for sunscreen. I have sensitive skin and this is the only sunscreen that doesn't cause breakouts.

eos-eos

Couldn't ask for more in a sunscreen. Has a tropical, coconut type scent in case that is an issue for some and more notable that alternative brands but not an issue for me.

eos-eos

It works!

Rubs in easily, smells great

eos-eos

It’s good lotion

I love this stuff! Doesn’t work for my kids because of sensitive skin. But this is safe for the ocean.

In the last few years I have had a reaction to certain sunscreens. We spend a lot of time around the water during the summer, my skin is sensitive and the product has worked well for me with no reaction.. Highly recommend for those who burn easily.

About ready to use for a great tan....smells so tropical.

super happy I was able to find it online. Will stock up every summer for sure

If you know sunscreen, you know that this is the top tier product. I love the smell and how easy it is to apply. Other sunscreen can take forever to apply, this is great a great product!

It's hard to find Spf 15 anymore

We like the way it feels on our skin. Not greasy and I think it is moisturizing.

Great value and price and does not break my skin out.

Protects when you sweat or swim.

Since I can't shop on my own, I sit at the computer and order everything I need.

De acuerdo a lo esperado

Soft coconut scent and it worked great for my family at the beach last week

eos-eos

Smells great--nice mix of tropical flowers! I like the variety of SPF choices available, too. It's worked well during the first few tests, including some time in the ocean.

eos-eos

Great product!

I never burn, and it smells SO GOOD. I'm honestly surprised how thinly it spreads. You'd never expect this type of lotion to be sheer, but I find it light even after reapplying.

eos-eos

It protects well.

Bought this for vacation and it worked to prevent a sunburn and smelled wonderful. Can't ask for more than that!

Good price

Love the 15 protection - hard to find these days!

Great sun protection product.

Smells good (gentle fruity), easy to spread. My kid likes it (age 6)

Love this sunscreen. Smells awesome too.

GREAT product, I have used it forever, only one application needed. I would suggest 2 applications if spending time in the water. Hard to find SPF 15 in stores, glad to see Amazon carried this product line.

Good stuff

Great value!!

Its Sunblock and it swells like good old Hawaiin Tropic

As described

Your eyes won't get that stinging feeling. I put this on my face including my forehead before I hit the tennis courts. I sweat while I play but no sign of stinging. Good stuff plus its not oily or greacy . Winner!

Great sunscreen! Doesn't feel greasy after application and didn't irritate my skin. Nice light fragrance too.

This is the best Sun tan lotion ever!!! Seriously never burn.... just reapply like you should.
