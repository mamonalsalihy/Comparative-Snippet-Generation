I was looking for a sunscreen for myself (adult) that is free of ingredients like oxybenzone and others that may harm the environment or absorbed by skin into the bloodstream. This comes up consistently as the recommended product. The cream is however very very thick and almost impossible to spread. If I weren't going to jump right into a water, I would say that it's very sticky and uncomfortable to have on.
