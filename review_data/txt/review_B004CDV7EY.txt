The only reason I bought this was because it said reef friendly. Boy was I wrong. If I could give this product a zero star rating I would. If you are purchasing this item because you are trying to protect the environment, look elsewhere. The manufacturer changed a couple of the molecules so legally they could claim it was reef friendly, but the product is just as harmful as any other sunscreen out there to coral and reefs. At the moment, the state of Hawai'i is trying to ban such products. If you really want a sunscreen that is environmentally friendly, do your research. I tried to post a link to some good information, but apparently that violated Amazons's comment policy. I really feel as if I was lied to. I would put this product in the Snake Oil category. Shame.

These guys are misrepresenting the product to try and off-load it before the FDA forces the removal from the market. Really sleazy. It contains Octocrylene, but this is omitted from the description.

This sunscreen takes a long time to rub in, but once it's on.. . It's on! Even after 8-9 hours of wear, I only had to reapply on parts of my skin that had been roughly rubbed with a towel or soaked with water. I went on a week long vacation to Florida, visiting the amusement parks and beach every day for 10 hours or more. Using this sunscreen, I did not burn AT ALL. I am incredibly pale and burn in minutes without sunblock, so for me that is a miracle. There's been many a time I've lathered on sunscreen and still came out a tomato, but this sunscreen worked flawlessly!  Pros: -lasts 8+ hours with only needing to reapply on areas that were forcefully wiped off or had long exposure to water -very effective at protecting against sun damage, even for pale or sensitive skin -works under makeup and leaves no white streaks if you massage it in thoroughly -has that familiar sunscreeny-summer smell... could be a con if you're not a fan of that scent  Cons: -slightly sticky feeling throughout the day, but to be expected with sunblock

I'm a redhead. I wear a lot of sunscreen all the time. I reapply every 2 hours. I HATE THE FEELING OF NORAML SUNSCREEN. I hate that oily, slippery feeling you get as it melts off you in the sun...especially when you end up with a sunburn even though you were wearing sunscreen. On top of that, I have sensitive skin, so I get itchy with some sunscreens.  ***THIS IS THE BEST SUNSCREEN I'VE EVER USED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.*** Literally. It's so lightweight I forget I'm wearing it, and it spreads easier than mineral sunscreens. No white cast and doesn't dry my skin out or irritate it. I have almost zero freckles this summer after wearing this every day, and that's a huge accomplishment for an Irish redhead. BUY. IT.

I'm a mom to two 7 year olds. We've been swimming nearly everyday for 2 hours. This sunscreen spreads easily. I had used the copper tone(spelling that way on case it edits the name, I'm trying to give an honest comparison) sport 70 before this one and the kids porcelain skin did not brown. As soon as we switched to this one their skin immediately had a tan. They never turned red or burned but they definitely have a medium tan now so I'm not repurchasing it, I'm going back to a thicker cream and higher spf. I did notice even after letting it sit for 20 minutes it still would run once they were in the water. The copper tone left an oil sheen and repelled the water, this is a lotion does not do that, it also left a film on the water. The smell is nice, it isn't pungent or anything. It doesn't smell like a tourist or anything and it is not noteworthy for being pleasant. It's just a bland sunscreen smell which to me is a good thing. I don't particularly want to smell like a coconut or something wild when I'm going for a swim. Who I would recommend this to is someone who is going to the beach or somewhere in the sun and they would like to have color but not burn. I'd reapply as it says though. If your skin is very fair I would go with a thicker cream and higher spf. If oily sunscreens break you out this would be a good option to try because it is a lotion and doesn't leave that oily feel behind. I hope this helps someone decide if this is the right product for them. The pump is nice for applying it.

one of the best sunscreen products on the market. I live in an area called the "lost coast"which refes to the fact that it is typically cloudy and foggy even in the summer so when I get near real-world weather I need skin protection like others need their suntan lotion. Having just come back from more than a week of living in that real world where temperatures are daily 20-30 degrees higher, the sun shines constantly, and we spent hours each day in the lake, I realize all over again why I've bought Banana Boat products since they hit the market. This bottle kept 5 people covered several times a day with plenty to spare after more than a week. It spreads well with minimal white residue which also rubs in and it provides good coverage without having to slather it on. Any greasy feeling is minor and lasts only as long as it takes to rub the lotion in completely. The smell is much better than most sunscreens; so much so it is the first of two sunscreens I've ever used to receive the grandkids smell of approval and no complaints at all. Protection is excellent if applied properly and according to instructions. Unfortunately even Banana Boat can't prevent the sting in your eyes when sweat runoff gets in there but there was no water runoff eye stinging even once and we practically lived in that lake for eight days. I did NOT receive my Banana product in consideration for a review, bought it out of my own pocket and will continue to do so as long as Banana Boat maintains their product integrity.

This is by far my favorite sunscreen. Not only does it work and protects my family from the sun, it is easy to use! I have 6 children, and sunscreen application can take FOREVER. However, the pump dispenser is sooo helpful. No crazy shaking the bottle to have the sunscreen spray everywhere. You can apply with one hand while holding a child in the other hand. The consistency also spreads easily, and the product lasts a long time thanks to the large bottle. I just bought my next bottle after using the last one nearly all last summer.

As people who spend most of our time outdoors and in and out of the water, Banana Boat has worked out to be the best overall product for skin protection that we have tried. It is easy to apply, non greasy, and lasts a very long time, even with long water immersion periods. We camp and windsurf, and a once-daily early morning application to face, neck, arms and legs lasts all day, although a second application can be helpful if, for example, you rub your face with a towel after coming out of the water. But it's amazing that it doesn't sweat off, even on very hot days, nor does it wash off while being splashed at 35+ mph on the water. And yet it washes off easily with soap and water, not like some other protections that you really need to scrub several times to remove.  There has been a lot of discussion about different chemicals in lotions possibly being as bad (that is, potential to induce melanoma) as no coverage at all, and this may prove to be true. But because the research keeps changing on this as with many other things that we use or consume, we've decided to use this as our primary skin cover. It's not a complete cover like some zinc-based lotions we've used--you do still tan a bit through it--but we have never burned with it, even with prolonged exposure.  If you were to use it wearing just a bathing suit and "lying out" all day, I'm not sure that it would work as well. We are quite careful to avoid direct sunlight whenever we can, so I'm sure that we are reducing overall exposure. But when every day is spent outside hiking and/or windsurfing, our best efforts to avoid sun still mean that we're getting a lot.  Our previous best choice was Solar Sense lotion, which is Zinc based. This seemed to provide even better coverage, and was also extremely water and sweat resistant. But it was thicker and therefor more difficult going on, and much harder to wash off at the end of the day--or even to thoroughly wash off your hands so it was cool to handle sunglasses without mucking them up. Banana Boat is much easier to clean up,and therefore is not as much of an issue. But Solar Sense may ultimately be the better protection.

I had been using the SPF 50 Sport for years as a daily lotion (skin cancer runs in the family and I'm outside a lot). I have sensitive skin, and liked this lotion. I was horrified to see it was reformulated and rebranded (from "Sport" to "Ultra Sport").  The ingredients, both active and inactive, changed considerably. The consistency changed, as did the scent. I actually prefer the new consistency to the old. The scent is okay - it's certainly MUCH stronger than it was before, so I could see this bothering people. It was didn't bother me though.  I had no problems with the reformulation, and my skin didn't either. Crisis averted. Still a good product.

So, I got this just for the pump functionality. I am an avid sunscreen wear-er anyway and I like trying new brands. I like the pump because its easier and as I am trying to step up my re-application game, having a pump bottle just makes it easier. In terms of the actual suncreen itself, it is fine. No whitecast. A little greasy, but does not feel sticky. I also did not experience any dying-of-clothes behavior.  Would I buy again? Yes.

I'm a runner who lives in California, sunscreen is an essential part of my running routine. This is my favorite sunscreen: - affordable - easy to spread and hydrating, doesn't leave any chalky residue - water and sweat resistant (as much as possible, no sunscreen is going to be 100% sweat resistant)  I will say it makes your skin pretty shiny, so if you don't want to look shiny you may want to look elsewhere. I'm fine with looking shiny. I even use it on my face without issues.

For years I couldn’t use these type of sprays because they killed my eyes when sweat got in them. It was literally debilitating. I narrowed it down to the two chemicals they are eliminated from this brand which is now described throughout the industry as Reef Friendly. (Make sure you are not sold old stock which comes in the identical can except it doesn’t disclaimer use of the oxy chemicals. A lot of companies and retailers are doing this.

Bought this for a week-long family vacation at a lake. When you know you’re going to need a lot of sunscreen for a lot of time on the water, it’s nice having a bottle like this that will last a long time. And the lotion went on easily, only took a minute or two to rub in (no longer streaky or sticky) and the protection lasted at least an hour while paddle boarding and swimming. Also used this on our faces without any stinging eyes. And my very fair skinned son (red head) used it and didn’t get burned at all.

Last year I decided I needed to take care of my skin. I've spent years getting a few minor sunburns and my share of the real burners that make you shiver at night. This stuff has been pretty good, it does have the sunscreen smell common with all sunscreens but I can barely smell it, and with lotion, over the top, the smell is gone. I try to apply it every few hours when in the sun.

PROS -Value! I shopped around and this is the best value I found. -BROAD SPECTRUM! 50S PF! -Personally, I can't smell it. Only if I sniff it or when I first put a large amount on my hand. But to be fair, I've never been sensitive to smells. ***I love the pump (with the close/open positions), it is very reliable. No matter what bottle I put in my purse (even the caps you twist close), somehow they ALWAYS end up spilling! :( Which is not only wasteful but messy. I have carried this bottle with me in my car, backpack, large purses and it has NEVER EVER spilled. -So much sunscreen you can share!  CONs: -It's big. But that isn't a con, really. If you want it to be portable, easy fix. Pump a little into a smaller container fixed! -It's a bit thick, but as far as I know, all sunscreens are (and keep in mind, if it's less than 35 SPF it's not really sunscreen, also if it doesn't have broad spectrum protection, it's only half the protection). Takes lots of rubbing in.  This sunscreen is a GREAT value. When I was contemplating buying a sunscreen my Amazon Prime free trial had just run out. I wasn't going to renew it but I went to Walgreens (which is cheaper than a lot of other stores) and looked at the sunscreens (and a couple other items I was shopping for). I took my phone out and compared the SPFs, oz amounts, and $ to the ones on Amazon. That settled it. I renewed my membership because with deals like this one, I KNEW I was going to shop in Amazon a lot more often.

This product smells okay. Spreads easily and gives me peace of mind. I became a head shaver this year, and while I always wear a hat while outside. Putting on this product is inexpensive protection against the possibility of skin cancer. I also apply it to my face, neck, forearms, and hands. I'll definitely be purchasing more when this bottle runs out.

We were going through a bottle of spray lotion EVERY trip for a day in the sun! Ugh...exhausting always making sure we had it on hand...and costly! I decided to go back to the lotion, and with this family sized bottle we have been on approximately 12 beach or fishing trips and still have a quarter of a bottle left. It has lasted all the way through summer! We literally go, go, go in the summertime, so we're always in need of sunscreen. Using this NO ONE got burnt! Not even once!!! Great product and great value!!!

eos-eos

We haven't tried all sunscreens out there, but of those we have used I like Banana Boat best. It doesn't smell and it goes on easily. When I saw it comes in a pump bottle I knew I had to get it. It may seem insignificant to some, but pump bottles for shampoo, hand lotion, bath soap and dish detergent have made my life so much easier! Well, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but they are more convenient and with life getting more complicated every day the little things that help do matter.  It's not the type of container that you can take with you, but it stays on the shelf where I can find it and my husband can't steal it and put it in his gym bag. Very convenient.

My daughter is a lifeguard and I purchased this after the brand she had ran out. Two days later, we had to get another one because all the other lifeguards of tried it and were asking her where to get it. It worked great on their variety of complexions. They all got this and raved about how it felt good on their skin

I am fair skinned and need to wear sunscreen almost everyday. This is the best I have tried so far in terms of price, convenience, feel, eye-irritation and effectiveness. I'm so glad I have finally found a good sunscreen that isn't sticky and burns my eyes when I sweat. I actually enjoy putting this on everyday as a lotion because it feels so good. Having a pump bottle makes it easy to make part of my morning routine. Price is very reasonable when compared to other high-end everyday sunscreens.

eos-eos

I have tried a lot of different sunscreens lately and usually the dispenser is the problem. The tube ones are difficult to get the product out of. The spray type dispenses too much or in an unpredictable pattern or is too oily. I was very happy with the ease of using this one. I have used Banana Boat before and it is a reliable quality sunscreen. Great product!

eos-eos

I've used another sport sunscreen that left a white residue in elbow creases an hour after it had been rubbed in well. Banana Boat sport doesn't leave any white residue, isn't greasy and doesn't appear to stain fabrics. I never burn with it and it gives me peace of mind that I'm protected while in the sun.

Like the title, this does what it's supposed to and does it well. I go biking 4-5 (1-2 hours) times a week and always have this on my face, and around my ears and neck. It protects me from getting sun burn with no second application needed. With the savings from "subscribe and save," is one of the best deals out there.

eos-eos

Goes on very smoothly. Creamy lotion consistency which is easier to smooth on skin. The fragrance is the traditional sunscreen aroma which is okay. Protects and definitely water proof for skin protection. Would recommend this sun screen.

I love this sunscreen. The smell is not as harsh as the Equate brand. I'm a Walmart shopper and didn't feel like going to the store so I purchased this online. I'm not sure how Amazon's price compares to Walmart's. I do know that I can use this daily because it has little to no scent. The Equate brand is very strong so I only use it for my morning jogs. I'm African American. I've never been sunburnt, but I still like to protect my skin, especially on vacation.

I have used this stuff for over a decade (though they changed the formula with Ultra sport) and it's the least greasy SPF 50 I've found that doesn't smell terrible. I am in a hot climate so I wear it on my arms every day so yes, people might smell it but it's not like you're going to the beach.  This IS a chemical sunscreen which is different than mineral sunscreens so do your research to see which you like. That means that this won't leave a white film on your skin, but it does feel "hot" if you go under the sun. My understanding is that the UV rays of the sun are converted to heat instead of getting absorbed by the skin. If you don't like that, go with a mineral sunscreen like Zinc Oxide but then those leave a protective film. I'm even wearing sweat wicking long sleeve shirts now when I work under the sun and found those to be the best protection, but I digress.

eos-eos

Thick consistency, but goes on/spreads easily. Starts out white, but disappears/is absorbed within a minute. Seems to do its job of protection from the sun. What I like about is that when it gets into my eyes from sweating during activity, it doesn't sting. Have already purchased another bottle.

I use copious amount of sunscreen, walking the dog in Texas. Every dermatologist recommends daily sunscreen use. This has a very light sunscreen scent, easy to spread, no white cast (I'm Asian). Would recommend and buy again.

I’m shocked at how good the price was, I use this over the summer, all summer long, and my baby did not have any problems. It has nice consistency and it is not sticky. Not foul smelling either. After trying out this product, I came back and bought it a couple more times and I recommended it to my mom as well. I definitely Standby this item side

I wanted a sunscreen that was big enough to have a pump. We keep this one at the door and lube up when we go outside. Very convenient! The smell is perfect too. Not overwhelmingly “sunscreeny”.

Keeps my lily-white Irish skin protected, just the right thickness for application, and neutral scent. I applied to my face and head every time I go out in the sun. I also use it when I run and I sweat, a lot. It stays on and keeps me safe from the melanoma and sunburns.

It works- and it's reef-safe, as required for Hawaii and the Caribbean.

Like that it's in a push-button container, making it easier for me to use. Also, it's works for the purpose it was intended, to protect me from the sun. Has no scent, which I very much like as I have problems with certain "perfumed" products.

I play golf 3-5 times a week and walk the course, with a push cart. In SC it gets hot and the sun is out a long time. I put this Banana Boat sunscreen on before starting the rounds and it seems to stay working the entire time I am playing. I likely lose some protection on my face from wiping the sweat a few times but, a good brimmed hat gives me an extra layer of protection keeping the sun off the face.

Perfect large bottle with pump top. We used this over the past two weeks with 90 -106 degree temps. We had several outdoor projects and this protected us from sunburns. We tanned but no burns!! Smells nice. light fragrance.

I have a family of freckled, light skinned, red heads. We swim the entire summer and go through about 10 bottles of this sun screen. It stays on in water and sweat. Easy to spread and rub in.

The only thing I know about sun burns is that I'm prone to them.  The only thing I know about sun tan lotion is that I need it.  This sunscreen saved my skin during the grueling four days that I spent in the Tennessee sun at Bonnaroo 2013.  I reapplied the lotion ever 3 hours, and came out with a beautiful tan and absolutely no burning.  As a side note, I didn't shower for the entire 4 days of the festival, and I didn't break out or anything. I was piling lotion on top of lotion on top of lotion with no ill effects. I don't know if that's even worth mentioning, but there you have it.

This is the best sunscreen I’ve purchased this year. It goes on easy like lotion and lasts. My family started buying it too and now we get mixed up taking each other’s bottles lol. Great product and amount of product for the price. Buy it!

This is the only sunblock I'll use from now on! I prefer lotion instead of spray to make sure that I get enough sunblock on, and this works perfectly! I don't get burnt, and the lotion is surprisingly non-greasy feeling. While my face feels a bit greasier with it, everywhere else, it's like I put nothing on. The smell can be strong when you first apply it, but after that, you're fine.

Provides control and safety for the user. After several weeks of sun, modest tanning occurred in Florida sunshine. I highly endorse the product and found it easy to use. I will buy again when our supply runs out.

My stomach got pretty badly burned when I used this product (I did reapply but maybe I didn’t wait long enough before getting back in the pool.) No where else got burned so maybe it was user error. it’s really easy to apply and doesn’t leave a greasy feel to the skin.

I do not recommend this product at all. The sunscreen worked and protected us from the sun, but it left an orange stain on EVERYTHING it came into contain with. I have never used a sunscreen that stained this bad. Any of our clothes, bathing suits and towels that were white or had any white around the edges were all stained.The stains you see in the picture are from using this sunscreen one day at the beach. It was the only sunscreen we used that day. Unless you wear all black when using this sunscreen I suggest you do not use it. I will never again.
