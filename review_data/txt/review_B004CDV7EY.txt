Sunscreen works well but doesn't have a nice fragrance

It works perfectly for me. Although it is a bit oily for my skin (depends on the skin for each individual) this gives good protection and a good scent feeling. Have to test it before swimming though

Like the pump container it comes in

I'm a runner who lives in California, sunscreen is an essential part of my running routine. This is my favorite sunscreen: - affordable - easy to spread and hydrating, doesn't leave any chalky residue - water and sweat resistant (as much as possible, no sunscreen is going to be 100% sweat resistant)  I will say it makes your skin pretty shiny, so if you don't want to look shiny you may want to look elsewhere. I'm fine with looking shiny. I even use it on my face without issues.

Es un poco aceitoso , pero nada que no se pueda solucionar

So we went on vacation. 8 of us. One of us used this. 7 of us got sunburnt. I let y’all guess who didn’t. This stuff protECTS! It’s my new staple!!

I wanted a sunscreen that was big enough to have a pump. We keep this one at the door and lube up when we go outside. Very convenient! The smell is perfect too. Not overwhelmingly “sunscreeny”.

Great for pool/beach days!
