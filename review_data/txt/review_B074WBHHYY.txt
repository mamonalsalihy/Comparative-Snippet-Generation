I got super sunburned using this sunscreen. I’ve used many sunscreens over the years, and this one left me very red. I’ll be throwing this in the trash!

Between baseball & softball and days at state Park with swimming lake, I needed this for me & grandkids!! The spray is soooo easy to use!! And CoopperTone a trusted brand.

The sprayer was very inconsistent and it was hard to tell what kind of coverage you were getting. Ended up getting sunburnt because of this. Wouldn’t buy again

Easy to use. Love it.

This stuff was decent in protecting a redhead with freckles in the las vegas dessert. After touring horseshoe bend and antelope canyon deep in page Arizona, I only was burned on the back of my right leg where I'm pretty sure I never sprayed any of this. I normally don't venture out unless spf 50 is with me. Easy to spray on, not gooey, and most importantly it keeps me from being burndt. I even wore it kayaking the emerald cave and lived fo tell about it.

The bottles are way smaller than the normal size ones that I usually buy. Tried to do a return, within the 30 day window, and found out that I can't return it!?! This is a first! What gives?

It works, easy to use. Got it with a coupon code so it was worth the price.

I have used multiple Sunscreens for years and have never experienced ANYTHING like this until I tried coopertone! I spend a lot of time in the sun on my motorcycle and I hope I you can see the picture of what this has done to my arms! A picture speaks a thousand words! My arms are incredibly rashed and terribly hived and scarred with no relief for weeks! There is something in this product that cause a Photoallergy reaction. AVOID THIS PRODUCT I AM ON FIRE!!!

Wehave been using coppertone sunscreen for a while. Our family loves it. We use it at the pool before swimming most of the times. It has SPF 50 which is great, also very moisturizing at the same time. Some sunscreeens if I use it on my face give’s tingling sensation and burns but havent had that issue with this one. Also i have a very acne prone skin and using this hasnt broke me out. This is my goto sunscreen during summer.
