This Coppertone Pure & Simple SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion is a great, physical barrier, sunscreen that is safe for kids and adults alike.  Sunscreens come in two varieties - physical barrier and chemical. Physical barrier sunscreens are just what they sound like - they use minerals to physically block UV rays. Remember the old, white, zinc, sunscreens of our youth? This is zinc oxide, too, but in a formula that is sheer. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV rays and render them harmless to skin however, the chemicals mimic hormones and there is concern about the long term effects of these chemicals on children. For that reason, I try to only use physical barrier sunscreens on children (and myself.)  This is a white lotion that is fragrance free so it has no scent. When rubbed in, it has only the faintest, white, cast. It is SPF 50 and is water resistant for up to 80 minutes so good for use in the pool or at the beach or when sweating. We have experienced no irritation from this product.  Do note that most people do not apply enough sunscreen. You need to use about a shot glass full to cover your body and face and you need to reapply regularly. Also, it should be applied 15 minutes before sun exposure.  I love this stuff. Completely safe and water resistant. Plus it's sheer!  UPDATE: My teen son went to the beach for the day for the first time this year with some friends. He applied this sunscreen (because I would obviously know if he didn't) but his friends chose not to. My son came back with no redness at all except a couple of tiny spots that he missed with the sunscreen but his friends were badly sunburned. This protected my son in and out of the water. (He reapplied several times during the day.) I am ordering more.

Been testing mineral sunscreens for a minute now. This one is better than many others, but still needs to be more spreadable and the price needs to drop. There is a kids mineral sunscreen, SPF 50, available in a store brand that is FAR better to put on and FAR cheaper. I won't name the store here but it rhymes with Shmarget.

I bought this based upon the recommendation of a Youtuber I watch regularly. She's a staunch advocate for physical sunscreens. Personally, I like them too. I used Cerave SPF 50 Mineral stick prior to purchasing this. Still do for quick applications. However, being darker skinned (I'm black) means the white film produced by zinc oxide and mineral sunscreens in general can be EXTREMELY noticeable on my skin. Still yet, I wear it because, factually, mineral sunscreen is superior in every way to chemical.  However, I relented because there are some situations where mineral sunscreen is a no-go: important meetings, etc. In those cases, I've discovered Coppertone Ultra Guard 70, which I also reviewed specifically to put forth the perspective of someone who's darker skinned. That is a great chemical sunscreen, however, after multiple uses, I find that I get a lot of burning and irritation on my face. Sadly, I've had to stop using it after initially loving it so much.  So, now I find myself back at the drawing board searching for a sunscreen with low to minimal obvious white residue, but also effective and non-irritating. As I said, based off a recommendation, I purchased this on a whim with low expectations because I already use a lot of physical sunscreens and 9 times out of 10 they leave an obvious white film (Personally, I hate the term white cast).  So, I tried this one and it does apply white, as to be expected, but once it dries the white film is much less noticeable--tolerable even! It doesn't apply smoothly. I have to use lotion first to be able to spread it more evenly on my face. So far, so good! I'll see if this review changes over a couple of weeks. It's nice to feel good, conscientiously, about the type of sunscreen I'm applying again.  I'll update if I experience any drastic changes.

Buyers Beware! Scientist widely agree the only safe sunscreen (for our porous skin and fragile ocean ecosystem) is Zinc Oxide. Yet despite Coppertone's labeling, I learned there is less than 10% zinc oxide in this bottle! Up to 90% of this bottle contains a majority of chemicals manufactured by Bayer (one of the leading pesticide and herbicide manufacturers in cancer causing ROUNDUP). Slick, misleading advertising by Coppertone/Bayer lulls you into buying it with environmental friendly buzz words like "Defend & Care" and nature loving "Pure & Simple" slogans slapped on this product.  Read the ingredients (see my photos) before you buy this bottle of chemicals. I'm feeling deceived by the labeling, and Im returning this bottle to the "wonderfully pure" manufacturer of many cancer causing (yet still legal) products.

I've used this about 5 times now. It's a little different from what I replaced - coppertone sport sunscreen. here's what I found:  Pro: uses zinc instead of Avobenzone (so healthier) blocks the sun really well - better than the regular coppertone stays on your skin for a long time Much cheaper than many other brands that use zinc  Cons bottle is a little smaller - 6 oz vs 8 oz. sunscreen is thinner so tends to run a bit as you apply (in your hand or if you put a bit on your leg or arm) *Very* difficult to remove. I have tried showering and scrubbed with a soapy washcloth, but still can't get it all off I note that my skin in a bit sticky to the touch where i attempted to remove this sunscreen Second day in a row application is a little worse since there is always residual from the day before makes your skin somewhat white - definitely noticeable (does not fully rub in)  I have *not* used this in water, so cannot comment about that.  Mostly, I'm trying to find a sunscreen that does not contain harmful chemicals (after using the 'bad' ones for years).  UPDATE: I have found makeup remover works well to remove his product. Since makeup remover is expensive, I’ve tried other things and found that castor oil followed by soft soap sequence (both applied before I apply water) works.

First off, note an odd regulatory situation means that sunscreen in the US can only use chemicals from >30 years ago. Many are both not that effective at preventing UV damage and are known to have harmful side effects but are grandfathered in, with stricter regulations precluding the approval of compounds safer than those grandfathered in. Synthetic chemicals with vastly superior UV protection and better safety profiles are widely available outside the US and are a better choice than this for most (if you look for Drometrizole Trisiloxane or Mexoryl XL there are probably sellers on Amazon, likely at ridiculously inflated prices) - I normally stock up on business travel to the EU, but that's obviously not happening right now.  Without more modern chemistry, inelegant solutions of smearing gobs of reflective white stuff on one's skin is the best you can get, which is what this sunscreen is. If you have any significant melanin/skin color you will look somewhat ridiculous if using the correct amount. It is very difficult to remove - just soap and water won't get it off; you'll need to use an abrasive compound.  Those two caveats are also primary selling points - this provides good UVA/UVB protection (much worse than modern chemical sunscreens, better than chemical sunscreens you can get in the US), and is extremely water resistant. Realistically unless you're swimming a single application will probably last an entire day.  As such I can recommend this if you're cool w/ the downsides, or want a sunscreen w/ the best safety profile. It's still possible to get modern chemical sunscreens shipped to the US (w/ delays of weeks) and they are barely more expensive than this, so I'd recommend that in general unless you're pressed for time.

The media could not be loaded. Thicker than most sunscreen lotions. Some people may not like this but I find the consistency easy to spread because it's not runny like other sunscreens. Zinc oxide makes it an automatic 5-star in sun protection. Yes it may leave a slight whitish tint on your skin but this is what all mineral sunscreens do. This forms the protective layer on your skin. Unscented, unlike most sunscreens which have a strong smell. Regular sunscreens leave my oily face even oilier. I've discovered that Coppertone Pure & Simple acts as an excellent blotter to the natural oiliness of my face, as though it absorbs the oils. I no longer have to blot my face later in the day. It does a great job of keeping my skin moisturized and supple the entire time, better than moisturizing lotions.

Dr Dray, a dermatologist on Utube, really likes this product, which piqued my interest. She claims the ingredients are similar to many high-end, fancy sunscreens that can be double or triple the price. EWG questions the level of protection, as they say its not as high as SPF 50.  After a week of using this, i figured out the discrepancy. For daily use this is fine. I wear this to the gym and it endures a weightlifting and 40 min cardio session.  It does not endure an hour long run in the Texas heat. It separates/lifts up into the sweat on my arms and dribbles off.  It does wash off with easily soap and water. I reduce scrubbing time by using jojoba oil to double cleanse first.  I like it for being inexpensive and sun protection is good, but more like SPF 30...not 50. UVA protection is balanced to UVB, so overall its good. Minimal white haze and more clear than most mineral sunscreens with such a high zinc active level.  I use this in the winter when I am outdoors less and the sun is not as strong (uv index only gets up to 3.0, rather than 11.0 in the summertime)

I almost didn't get this cause of some bad reviews but I gave it a try.. So glad I did. For the body I really like! I got this for me & my kids.. I put this on my hand and let it sit for about 20 mins, I am medium skin, no cast very well dried and no sticky feel. You can only see it in pic but not in person it blends on me. of a little smell very light. I think the key is you just gotta let dry. And for package very well done no spills. I got this here only because I didn't feel like going to the store lol.. But yes you can get this at stores at home for like 1 or 2 dollars less.

I have psoriasis and need a product to block the sun from my face, chest, shoulders and arms. I'm naturally pasty and never tan I just burn. I noticed many people were upset that this did not get absorbed into the skin. This is not a sunscreen it is a sunblock. Sunblock is not meant to be absorbed into the skin it is supposed to sit on your skin and block the sun. That being said expect it to stay white on the skin. Because it is a sunblock and sits on your skin there is no 20 minute wait to go out into the pool or in the sun the way you have to wait for sunscreen to be effective. It is the same consistency as a lotion, it does spread easily and as promised it is safe for sensitive skin and does not have any odor or fragrance. It is water resistant so expect a bit of work when you shower. I live in Arizona so I need some serious sun block when it is 110 degrees outside. During the time I was outside I did not burn or even tan, so it fulfilled the promise to deliver in protecting the skin on the broad spectrum. Out of the other similar products this had the most product at 6 oz and was less expensive.

I purchased this for my daughter who has eczema/sensitive skin. She has not had any issues with this sunblock. No rashes or itching. You do need to reapply this after about 2 hours, which is typical for most sunblock. It is very easily spread and will pour out of the bottle, so make sure you keep the cap closed. I attached a picture of the back of the bottle for more ingredient information.

It is unlikely that one will find a mineral sunscreen with this high concentration of zinc oxide for the price and the quantity. Despite some of the reviews, I found this sunscreen easy to apply to my face, neck area, ears, my facial hair, my arms and my hands. I use a men's face wash to remove it in the shower, while I use a bar of soap to remove it from my arms and hands. It is not difficult to remove, but it does leave traces on your skin if you simply wash and aren't scrubbing. I do not recommend to anyone that they should aggressively scrub or rub their skin to remove this sunscreen as this can cause loss of skin elasticity.  The other thing that I enjoy about wearing this sunscreen is that when I consume a beverage, it does not drip into the glass as it is sturdier than another mineral sunscreen lotion that I use that DOES this. I often have had to either wipe my mouth area of the sunscreen or change my beverage often to avoid consuming sunscreen. I do not have this problem with this sunscreen as it remains tighter on the skin.  This sunscreen does leave a white cast, similar to a white cast of another mineral sunscreen that I use. The white cast that it leaves is heavier than the sports mineral sunscreen version of this brand, but it is tolerable. The sports mineral sunscreen version is drippy and runny while this version is not.

I have pale skin with rosacea and i work outside most days, long as I reapply this it keeps me from breaking out or burning.  Good ingredients, best price I personally have found for something with these ingredients (physical sunscreen spf 50+ Truly fragrance free, no lemon balm or anything else that’s irritating) I wish i could find something like this without palm oil ingredients but alas one thing at a time. Cant fight deforestation if i get skin cancer first.  It dose leave a white cast but honestly not as bad as other physical sunscreens at this spf. More of a purple cast than a white one.  I highly recommend this product.

I really like this sunscreen so far. It takes a bit of friction to get it to rub in where you don't see white streaks, but that's the same for any mineral-based sunscreen. I like that it's a bit more liquidy than other brands that I've tried, such as Alba or Jason, which can sometimes have the consistency of peanut butter. So far it's kept me from getting burned really well, and seems pretty waterproof.  Negatives: It does feel a bit greasy. Because it is waterproof, i feel like it takes a lot of scrubbing with soap in the shower to actually fully remove it. It has a bit of a sheen, and feels pretty heavy for use on the face. When I do use it on my face, I feel like eventually my eyes feel a bit of burning from it. Not sure I've found a sunscreen that doesn't do this, though.

I love this stuff. Been using on my kiddos all summer at the beach, in the pool and just playing outside. I mostly use on our faces and shoulders. As we seem to tan well on our arms and couldn't get a burn no less a tan on our legs if we wanted to. I know it works because we have been burn free all summer. Also it seems a lot more water resistant and noticed I didn't need to apply as often outside of water than the chemical stuff we used to use. Pros: goes on well, washes off easy with soap, lasts a while. And it's great for my kiddos super sensitive skin conditions.

One thing to note before buying: this is a mineral sunscreen.  That means:  1. It will make your skin look whiter/lighter 2. It can be difficult to take off (although I have not had much trouble with using soap and warm water) 3. It has a notable odor  But it also means:  1. It will not conflict with your reproductive system (yes, chemical sunscreens can mess up your hormones) 2. It will not damage reefs or the environment in any way 3. It will not have any other negative effects on your health like chemical sunscreens do  This is the cheapest mineral sunscreen I have found. It is not particularly oily. It does the job well IME.

This is an SPF 50 mineral zinc oxide based sunscreen. This of course means that it is going to leave a SEVERE white cast even if you have fairer skin, but it does do its job and certainly is water resistant. I really appreciate the low price point of this product especially since it is hypoallergenic. Though this term is pretty vague since you can have an allergy to anything, it is nice that it has no fragrance and calming botanical extracts. It is a little difficult to spread on oily skin which aside from the white cast, is the only downside. A possible down side as well is that it is kind of difficult to remove. It is water resistant so you will have to use an oil balm or cleanser to remove it. Water will not suffice. Overall I'd say this is perfect for everyday use but maybe preferably for the body than the face.

This is working well to prevent sunburn! It is very white when it goes on your skin until it gets absorbed and worked in. But it is 100% worth it to me to put natural sunblock on instead of chemical sunscreens. The chemical ones give me an instant headache and my kids start coughing when they are around the chemical some blocks. There’s no way that’s good for anybody’s body.

I tossed my old sunscreen and got this after reading an article on ConsumerLab about benzene in sunscreens. Apparently Coppertone Peure and Simple does not contain carcinogenics like avobenzone, octisalate...and has not been reported to contain benzene or benzophenone, also carcinogenic. Sunscreen should protect you from skin cancer, not increasing the risks of getting cancer. Yes, you my look a little white after you put it on your face, but it's a small price to pay for something that is good and works.

This mineral sunscreen is a great value. It's thin, and absorbs into the skin fairly well. I'm light skinned, and it does leave a white cast; however, in my case, it is not that noticeable. Much less so than with some other mineral sunscreens I've used. I use this on my face. It isn't overly drying, and dries to a nice sheen. I do see some streakiness when I reapply if the initial layer hasn't worn off. I wear it every day at home, and if I'm going to be out and about (which is rare, these days), I simply put a little powder on over it, and the cast is not noticeable. It hasn't caused any breakouts, either. I'm impressed.

I have been exclusively using mineral sunscreens for the past 4-5 years. My primary use is while playing tennis (3-4x/week) and other outdoor activities (hiking, canoeing, etc). I decided to try this after i discovered that my spray on mineral sunscreen was too thin and still letting me get burned.  Pros: Easy to spread and a bit thinner than some of the titanium/zinc ones i've used in the past. Not as pale looking - less comments about "kabuki" makeup. Cons: This sunscreen comes off easier when i'm toweling sweat off. I've had to reapply or my face will feel tingly after playing.  Overall this sunscreen is excellent, just need to remember to reapply as necessary.

I have fair skin and burn easily. I've used a lot of different brands, but this has worked the best for me. I will say, you do need to put it on at least 15 minutes before you go out. It suggests 30 minutes. The first day out, I applied it 30 minutes before I went out. I didn't burn at all. The 2nd day, I put it on a few minutes before and I burned. Still not as bad as I usually do though! It's slightly runny, so just be ready for it to come out rather quickly. It's a lighter solution, so it doesn't feel heavy on. I would highly recommend!

My son has always been allergic to any aersol sun screen but this year lotion sun screens started breaking out and blistering his skin. I got this in hopes that it would work for him. Indeed it did. Super smooth with light white cast. SO far no rashes, blisters or welps on him. It has protected his skin well and smells good. It actually has quite a light smell. It smells like any sunblock but not nearly as strong. Love this product and it has a great price

This is a really great suntan lotion. No bad chemicals, not greasy, it works really well, and it is very well absorbed. And best of all (for me) there’s no suntan lotion stink. I do not like the smell of suntan lotion, and when I put other ones on my face I constantly smell it. This one is odorless. The only minor complaint is that it is a bit thin and runny. That makes it easier to spread but it runs out of the bottle too fast if you are not expecting it. Maybe they should make the opening a bit smaller?

° I have bought 3, and I can safely say that: At first it has a rubbery texture that may seem inhibiting the application, but this disappears quickly. In the same way, the white layer that it leaves disappears and remains practically unnoticeable. ° Protects very well with direct sun exposure. I have tried it in tropical areas at noon with any problem; no sunburn. ° Although not greasy, the sunscreen leaves a slight shine on the skin, but not more so than most sunscreens, including chemicals. °°Without a doubt the best that I have been able to acquire.

Zinc oxide has many advantages as a sunscreen, and this is a decent brand. It lasts well, it doesn't sting my eyes, and it is hypoallergenic. The one disadvantage is that it doesn't vanish as well; it has a little bit of a white cast. But so what? I need sunscreen when I go hiking or swimming, I don't need it for formal dinners or business meetings.

I needed a product that does not have avobenzone, as most sunscreens contain this chemical and it reacts with iron in well water turning laundry orange in color when the sunscreen inevitably gets onto the collars and sleeves of shirts and ends up ruining the clothing. This mineral based sunscreen does not have that chemical and will not leave laundry orange. Mineral sunscreens are the only ones I buy now because of this issue. Check the labels if you have this problem.

I took this sunscreen with me for a week long trip to the beach, i applied several times each day and I am happy to report i was fully protected from sun burn. I will say the lotion does not dissipate easily, it takes a while to soak in after each application. There is some minor difficulty in removing the lotion while showering.

I use to use Blue Lizard then they reformulated and I was afraid it wouldn't work as well. Through a long hard look for sun screen this has made it to the top of my list. Great for my sensitive skin. Does leave a slight chalky white film on skin. That make it easy to see where applied and iff it is still there while outside.

Been wearing sunscreen religiously since starting Tretinoin last winter. Needed something for daily indoor wear working from home in front of a window. Found that chemical sunscreens burn my eyes like crazy, but mineral sunscreens were too drying, especially with Tret making my skin drier. I saw a recomendation from Dr. Dray that this one had a moisturizing ingredient, kelp (I think). It's not drying and I use daily for no meeting (no makeup days). Price is great for daily wear. I use Cerave Hydrating Tinted as or with makeup if I have meetings.

This product works super well for skin protection. My dermatologist told me that I needed to move to a mineral only sunscreen and this fit the bill. I put it all over my entire family for a 15 day beach trip reapplying every 2 hours and no one got a hint of a burn the entire time (we also went through several bottles of it). It’s bomber for sun protection. And where some sunscreens sting on cuts and burns, this one isn’t painful to wear at all. My only complaint is that in combination with the salt water and wind, it really dried out our skin. It seemed, after several days, the the area where sunscreen was applied most (like faces - see pic) was so dry, and in some places flakey and cracking where my daughters complained of pain. It is worth noting that I got this same brand that is specifically for faces and had the same problem.

I am a person who normally could buy and use ANY sunscreen with no issues. This summer I broke out horribly. Twice with two different kinds of sunscreen (one was supposed to be mineral, natural etc etc). To the point I was on steroids, anti itch meds etc . My sister in law recommended this sunscreen and now my whole family uses it. You can still get a tan but not burn and I did not break out at all! The only thing I don’t like is how difficult it is to get off your skin. I read some other reviews and tried coconut oil before I showered and it works pretty well. To me, that is minor compared to the reaction I had with the others. I have gotten three other bottles since then.

I was wanting a natural sunscreen since I have to wear a lot as I am very pale. I came across Coppertone pure and simple. I read the ingredients and then I read the reviews. I was a little nervous when people talked about it not soaking in and being sticky. I did not have this experience but did read on the bottle to shake well before use. I shook well and maybe thats why I didn't run into some of the issues others have. Anyway I used this while being out in the sun a lot walking Philadelphia. It did the trick and I did not get burned. So very happy I took a chance and tried the sunscreen.

I can speak to it's resiliency against pool water or ocean water but it handles sweat well. I put on one application and was outside for six hours of peak sunlight on a day that registered a 9 UV index. Not one hint of red on my exposed skin. Easy to apply. Feels light on your skin. Does not have the normal white cast one experiences with most mineral sunscreens.

I decided to use a mineral-based sunscreen this year for my sensitive, eczema-prone skin. I spent a week of vacation on the beach this summer and used this the entire time -- no sunburn, no sensitivity flare-up of my skin. You need to rub it in a little more than regular sunscreen, and it felt a little difficult to wash off easily, but that may be a good thing if you're out swimming in the ocean as I was. I was satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase it.

Basically, on various product reviews by well-know, or even unknown doctors and other professionals they give this a thumbs down, for various reasons. But they all seem to readily admit this still provides excellent sun protection! I mean, this costs $5.50. You are NOT getting a glam package with a $80.00 per ounce product! This works as well, or better than many more expensive brands. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for!

2 years ago I started getting very itchy, red and bumpy skin (that would start flaking a few days after) after being outdoors. My doctor said it was all in my head—even though my skin was obviously in distress.  Without medical help It took some time to figure out it was sunscreen- any and all I tried until this one! Now I can hike, garden and kayak without suffering for my time in the sun!! Thanks for saving my skin!!!

Was surprised Coppertone being a major sunscreen player actually made a safe EWG approved sunscreen. (It gets a 1 on their website).  Goes on a little too easy as laying the bottle on it's side during applying will often let it spill out or often squeezing out too much, but that's a good thing.  The whitish color does fade rather quickly so that's a plus too.  Very affordable!

My son has a rare sun allergy... and his skin is extremely sensitive than most children with sensitive skin. I have tried many for sensitive skin... I have used this one all week for my son outdoors and my son has had not one reaction! But I think the best part is, it's NOT greasy!!!!!!! Which seems like the total norm for sunscreen. It rubs on soft... which is so much easier on a sensitive child's skin! I'm so happy I gave this a try! We will be purchasing many more ...as we all will be using it. Thank you for making an amazing sunscreen without all the bad but also, not a pain in the neck to apply!

This sunscreen does not sting (any and all chemical sunscreens sting me no matter what filter). Some mineral sunscreens are very thick, this one spreads easily. I have olive skin on the lighter side. It spreads with a very white cast at first. But it blends in and disappears after 10 minutes for me. It’s not too drying but i have others more moisturizing than this one like cerave.

Although it’s kind of like applying glue, this stuff works all day on my daughter and me in the pool and the ocean. You see the water bead up. It does not come off, and this is the first summer I haven’t burned my nose and shoulders! It’s hard to wash off in the shower and my skin has appeared ashy.

I have spent hundreds of dollars on sunscreens over the years. With a family history of malignant melanoma, I take sun protection seriously. In my opinion it's challenging to find a good physical sunscreen with 20% zinc oxide that does not leave you ghostly white. This one did not leave my fair skin ghostly white. It is a bit shiny, but I put powder over it no problem. I will definitely buy again.

I was a bit skeptical about the reviews, but I'll give it 5 stars. Very easy to spread without leaving a white residue. I applied it in the morning and spent the whole day high altitude hiking at 3,500 meters - in full sun - without getting burned. Day after day. I'm impressed.

This sunscreen worked well and was easy to apply. I purchased as we were traveling to Hawaii, planned on going snorkeling and knew this product was safe for use in the ocean around reefs. One day I stayed out, face down in the water snorkeling, for longer than this product recommended for its effectiveness, so my back and shoulders got a little burned. Read the label carefully, abide by their instructions and it will work fine.

I love this stuff for my face and shoulders. Held up super well in hot Mexico sun while boogie boarding. My go to sunscreen! Not the cheapest, and leaves a white tint (which I kinda like, so I know it’s working) - but super effective on my pale skin.
