I‚Äôm now a big fan of this brand after investing in a couple of products for a week-long beach vacation. This spray sunscreen goes on totally clear and works great. I‚Äôve been out in the sun a bunch for 4 days now and I‚Äôm not burned (I do re-apply as directed). I feel like this really stays put, even in water. The smell is also really enjoyable.  My only drawbacks are: - The nozzle does clog on occasion‚Ä¶seems to be related to turning the bottle upside down. In every single case, I was able to get it working again pretty quickly by cleaning off the nozzle and attempting to spray again (repeat). - We‚Äôve gone through these cans pretty quickly. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any less product in the can for the size than any other brand. I just think we don‚Äôt loathe applying this like some other sunscreens, and we historically bought the large size in spray sunscreens. Would love for them to make a larger can version so I don‚Äôt burn through so many cans (and therefore plastic nozzles)  I also purchased their clear stick sunscreen version to use for my face, and my MIL has already ordered herself one because she loves that so much. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with either of these.

Bought this for a vacation in Florida and would definitely buy again. I am an "over-user" of sunscreen and am constantly re-applying, so I loved that this didn't feel greasy with how many layers I put on. I also loved that there wasn't an overpowering smell when applied. It goes on light and evenly and does not dry out your skin.

Smells great. Works great. First spray that worked for kids too. They have fair skin. They did not burn and we didn‚Äôt reapply as often as what we usually use.  Works great for running and cycling in 85+ degree heat and 100% humidity.

Seriously the best SPF Spray I've ever used. It smells like a beautiful sunny day on the beach and it's non-greasy which is a huge plus. Used it during a golf trip to AZ and it held up against the desert sun! Can't recommend enough.

Smells great and protects incredibly well. Spent the whole day in the sun and did not get burned at all.

No burn from sun or product as i have read on reviews. And im extremely fair skined

I was looking for a sunscreen spray that was not only good for my skin, but also hydrating. This spray hit the mail on the head, and after a long winter the first application was perfect, plus it smells like vacation, sweet and sunny

I would put this sunscreen spray on just for its scent! It smells amazing (but not too strong). The actual spray comes out as a light, clear mist and leaves your skin feeling hydrated -- totally different from any drugstore brand sunscreen sprays I've bought in the past. You don't have to rub it in which is a major plus. It's my new go-to!

Used in FL (currently July) and didn't burn. Obviously re applied as needed. Free of the harmful chemicals that some of the cheaper brands have. Worth the extra few dollars

Stocked up on this for our family vacation to Cabo San Lucas. I love the SPF 50 spray, but the thirty should let me get a tad bit more color. Waterproof, so it‚Äôs great for pool and beach days and smells amazing.

eos-eos

Smells amazing, easy to spray and lasts all day! I love this more than the super goop and other brands. Been using this more this summer and I won‚Äôt use anything else.

Goes on easy and stays on. No sunburns hereüòÇüòÇ

This is a fantastic product. SPF and keeps skin fresh

This sunscreen is amazing. I've tried it on several occasions. The lake, waterpark, biking and tubing down a river. It goes on dry with no oily residue and I haven't been burned yet after using it.

This is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù sunscreen. Keep it with me all the time to protect the skin!

eos-eos

Love this! Protection for the sun is great, it‚Äôs not greasy, easy to spray. Smell is so yummy. My kids love it and it‚Äôs safe for them!

great for reef swimming! protects the fish and your skin!

spray bottle was easy to use and provided complete coverage, the sunscreen worked well and didn't need to reapply for a while

Feels light and protects well. Has so many other skin benefits too. 5 stars!

This sunscreen left me feeling so hydrated especially after being out in the sun all day! Would definitely buy again

It works great.

Best spray sunscreen on the market! Adequate protection with only a few sprays and great hydrating feeling.

Doesn't feel "greasy" like other sunscreens

Recently tried O+A skincare products for sun exposure and been happy with all of them

Great sunscreen without the gross sticky feeling, definitely recommend.

eos-eos

It has an amazing smell, leaves me moisturized, and protects me from the sun for hours!! 10/10!

eos-eos

Scent is great

eos-eos

Not greasy, easy to rub in, waterproof and has vitamin E and Squalane, natural ingredients that are usually found in much pricier skincare products. Probably the best sunscreen formula on the market. I usually prefer sprays for my sunscreen, but this stuff is different from any lotion I have ever used.

eos-eos

Love this sunscreen! Has a nice scent to it, and finishes light, not too sticky like other sunscreens I have tried. Perfect for everyday use, at the pool, or during an outdoor workout! Adding this staple to the rest of my Oars & Alps favorites.

eos-eos

I have purchased other products from Oars + Alps before and am always satisfied. When it comes to sunscreen, I prefer the spray-on while my partner prefers the lotion. This lotion is so light on the skin when applied and smells great, which is a plus!! It applies super evenly and withstands water and sweat for hours.

eos-eos

Unfortunately this wasn't a hit for me. It stung my face and ran out quickly, which I know sounds like that old joke about two ladies at a restaurant, "This food is terrible--and such small portions!" But still. I used it on my arms and that was fine but I'm kinda bummed because I thought the antioxidants and "hydration" would be good on my face.

eos-eos

Used one day at the beach. While I was at the beach I went to reapply. Nozzle was completely broken. Wouldn‚Äôt press down to spray at all. Locked up for some reason. Complete waste of money because it can‚Äôt be returned. I also felt greasy, it looked apparent. When I sprayed my face I swear it burned my lips.

eos-eos

High end sunscreen without all the chemicals!

eos-eos

Light weight sunscreen. Absorbed very quickly too. Was at beach all day and had no issues! Highly recommend

eos-eos

Goes on smooth and doesn‚Äôt leave you feeling sticky. I am very fair skinned and I spent the day in the sun and never got burnt!

Great sunscreen and easy to use packaging

Great everyday lotion, nice having the built in spf protection as well

eos-eos

Good quality sunscreen

Loved this sunscreen! Really helped protect my boys who burn easily. The lotion is unscented and has really nice ingredients. Well worth the money.

eos-eos

I wanted to really like this product but after initial use the plastic nozzle inside broke and couldi no longer spray.

eos-eos

Great sunscreen for the price. Hiked a few times and does the trick

eos-eos

I bought this to try something new. The spray goes on evenly and has delivered on the sun protection part. The smell is not too strong and isn't bad. However, if you can taste sunblock after it soaks into your skin, avoid this. It tastes awful. Even when I only put it up to my chin, had nothing on my face, and used a hat instead, I could still taste some of it somehow.

eos-eos

This was a gift for hubby. We both found the can to be difficult to spray but the mist is fine. The scent is nauseating - wish lotions would be unscented. There‚Äôs no need to smell like a gross perfume-y tropical drink. Also, super greasy. Expensive for a sub-par product. There‚Äôs better out there.

eos-eos

Love the product itself but the twist top got jammed and stopped spaying well after my first use. Also lose a point for having Octocrylene, which is bad for reefs and banned in the virgin islands. (This product is not considered reef safe according to USVI law because of this)

eos-eos

I love it! It's non greasy, lasts and hydrates my skin.

eos-eos

Out of two of the cans that arrived only one worked. The other one clogged after one use and I haven‚Äôt been able to get it working again.

eos-eos

I tried to return this during the designated return window because the first time I tried to use it the spray wouldn‚Äôt come out. It‚Äôs broken. It says this item isn‚Äôt eligible for returns. So irritated bc this sunscreen isn‚Äôt cheap.

I recently bought this sunscreen to take on a cruise. Several hours after the first application, my arms, legs, neck, and ears where I applied it became red and irritated, which took nearly a week to subside. My skin has never been sensitive, so I‚Äôm at a loss as to why this product caused such a severe reaction.  I‚Äôve used numerous Oars+Alps products on my face and body, and wanted to love this sunscreen. I‚Äôm very disappointed, but won‚Äôt be deterred from using their soaps, body wash, or facial cleansers and moisturizers.

eos-eos

I bought this trying to get a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù sunscreen. I used it on my daughter Saturday and she only burned in the places that I put the sunscreen. I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs a coincidence.

eos-eos

Love the sunscreen. One of our two bottles didn't spray at all which was a frustrating waste of money. I'm OK paying a bit more for animal friendly sunscreen.....but not if I can't get it out of the bottle!
