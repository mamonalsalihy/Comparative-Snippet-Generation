This rubs in/smoothes on the best of any mineral based suncreen i've used. Expensive but my favorite after trying dozens of brands.

I really wanted to like this, but as a person of color it unfortunately leaves a white cast. Only have used it twice so can't speak on if it helps acne or anything but it doesn't have a sticky residue or anything. Soaks into the skin but like I said if you're darker complexion it leave leave a white cast on your face. And I've tried rubbing it in a lot! And it just kind of gives a weird color to my face

I really like this sunscreen! It works great under makeup and is light weight. However, I took a star off because the scent reminds me of dirty feet! The smell will eventually dissipate, but I just wish the smell was a little nicer.

The sunscreen smells awful!!!

I love this as a primer for makeup it blocks out the redness from the heat and sun and kept my face looking fresh and not burnt when walking around the city on vacation

I compared this to my hero sunscreen I bought directly from the website and this is not the same product. The bottle is a different color and the labelling is worded differently than real hero cosmetics. Returning, wanted to alert others.

This product is pretty drying to my skin and it also leaves a white cast. I usually love products from HERO but this one was a thumbs down.

Lives up to its name! This sunscreen is my hero. After YEARS and hundreds of dollars wasted, I have FINALLY found a sunscreen that I can use every single day, all day long, with NO BREAKOUTS! I have the most acne prone skin on the planet. I refused to use SPF until I was 28 because no matter what brand or formula I tried I would always wind up with 20 huge and painful cysts on my face that would take 6 months to clear. I have struggled with adult acne for 12 years and this has not only prevented me from breaking out further, but I'm almost positive this cleared my skin. Seriously. After a month of daily use (including reapplying) I haven't had a single break out. The green tint DOES help cover redness and makes my red/purple acne scars slightly less terrifying. The white cast is minimal and will dissipate in a few minutes. If you have dry skin consider moisturizing first, otherwise this is an oily skinned person's dream. Hands down 10/10 best SPF I have ever used and I will never try anything else. ACNE SUFFERERS - PLEASE TRY THIS!

Smells like dog frito-feet smell, slightly, straight out of the bottle. But it is lightweight and doesn't appear to make me shiny like so many other face sunscreens. Still looking for *The One*

Not too greasy, lightweight texture. Unfortunately it pills with my established combination of makeup and skincare. It also makes my face itch a bit. I was looking for something more affordable to replace the painfully expensive sunscreens I already use. My skin, unfortunately, ain’t having it. I will use it up on my hands. Seems like a nice product with beneficial ingredients for lots of others though! We’re all different. Worth a try.
