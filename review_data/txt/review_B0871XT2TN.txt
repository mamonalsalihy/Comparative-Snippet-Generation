I bought these out of desperation . I have been trying to find a way to keep my glasses from fogging with a medical mask on. I tried anti fog spray, soap, all the advised things. Nothing worked. I bought motorcycle glasses (advised by CDC as the virus can get in through our eyes as well and they recommend eye coverings. While they are not prescription I see better with them with totally fogged glasses. Unfortunately they did not do the trick (although much less fogging, still some. So I tried these nose guards and SUCCESS! Still using the motorcycle glasses but NO FOGGING AT ALL! Clip to the glasses, wear over the outside of mask. SO VERY HAPPY NOW!!!

These nose covers are so light you can forget you have them on. There are two holes to choose from for attaching to glasses. They have come loose a couple times, and are easy to reattach. The reason they come apart may be because the silicone is so soft. We did not trim ours, as we want the full coverage. They look a bit funky, sort of like your nose is bandaged at first glance. We have received several comments, all positive from like-minded people who want to protect themselves from UV exposure.

The media could not be loaded. Comfort is great, it's not thick, very thin and great value for money $25 for 4 PCs, I had moehs surgery and I spend a lot of time outdoors,my dermatologist suggested I buy this, highly recommend!

I had a basal cell excised from my nose with a skin flap placed. So it‚Äôs very important that I don‚Äôt get any sun exposure. I live in South Florida where the risk of sunburn is a 365 day a year threat. This product is perfect. It covers my nasal area fully, it is comfortable, and it doesn‚Äôt stick to my nose. It sits just above it to let air circulate. I‚Äôm an avid walker, and I frequently walk for an hour at the hottest time of the day. Wearing this is very comfortable. I highly recommend it.

I bought this product because my nose was being treated for severe chronic sun damage & any sun on my nose would cause further damage. It works well for my situation. I wore in the pool with my sunglasses, cutting grass etc. I had to trim it down which I'd rather it be too big than too small

I‚Äôm a cyclist . With more than 250.000 miles cycling . You can imagine with all that cycling that I have had facial skin cancer.That mileage represents at least three hours a day for years .As I got older and wiser I started using zinc oxide and titanium oxide sunscreen. Unfortunately sunscreens DONT stay that well on your nose . After multiple MOHS nose surgeries . I have become even more cautious. I don‚Äôt have that much nose to donate anymore. When I was entertaining a nose shield. I didn‚Äôt see any designs I liked . I didn‚Äôt even like this design. Basically the attaching method to the glasses was useless. When I got the nose shields it was confirmed. . However. I discovered that it would stay in place simply by it being pinned physically between my face and my glasses. I‚Äôve ridden 60 miles in 90¬∞ plus weather and it stayed in place and worked better than expected . I notice after previous rides that my nose was swollen from sun exposure even with sunscreen. Not so after using the shield. I still don‚Äôt like the attachment method. However the product works and stays in place.

The Coolnes nose shield is an ingenious product that fits securely and really protects your nose. I recently had surgery for skin cancer on my beak and the new skin is still extremely sensitive to the sun. Eight weeks from the skin graft, the skin on the tip of my nose remained red and scabbed even with only brief daily exposure to the sun -- I feared I'd get skin cancer all over again. Within 2-3 weeks of using the nose shield, which has 50+ UV protection and I used repeatedly with long exposure outside here in Denver, no more scabs and my nose looks more or less normal. I'll keep wearing the guard most of the time for awhile yet outside just to be safe, as I'm happy to resemble Groucho Marx until my nose has a tan.  Coolnes is also a generous company. In the package of 4 nose shields, they include an invitation to get another package of their products for free. This free package includes a second set of 4 nose shields, a package of 4 red masks with ear attachments, and yet another package of 4 different-colored neck bands that keep your glasses & masks from falling to the ground. All of these items have UV50+ protection. Very cool!  I highly recommend this company and its products. Especially the nose shield!

Works exactly as advertised, looks maybe a little silly (exactly as advertised). I was really hoping this would direct the air coming out of my nose and mouth, so that my glasses wouldn't fog while wearing a mask? Unfortunately it had zero effect on the glasses fogging. I'm sure they're fine for sun protection though

Had surgery on the nose for skin cancer and wanted something to protect the area from the sun. Noticed when purchased that several reviews were negative concerning the attachment to the glasses. Found the attachment to be very secure and can only assume that those reviews were the fault of assembly by the purchasers. Units are light and comfortable and very adequate for the job! Would definitely purchase again when required.

This is light and comfortable. I bought the nose covers for my husband, who had a severe photosensitivity reaction to a medication, but I‚Äôve used one myself while on the water. I look funny wearing it, but otherwise, it‚Äôs great.

First, I feel that this is a great product. It is easy to assemble. I found them to work with my glasses and sunglasses. Comfortable and flexible. So wonderful. I'm so very excited to find this product! I just wish that I had found them years ago. CoolNES covered to shield the full area of my nose. I don't even know that I'm wearing them. They are great for me. There is a 4 pack with varied colors- which I find is a great selection to have and use. I wear them when driving and out and about on daily routines. They are exactly what I was looking for and needed. I actually found a different company first with a different product and sent an inquiry email out and never heard back from that company. So I kept searching and THANKFULLY, I found CoolNES and I'm so happy that I did. I sent an email and heard back promptly. Great customer service and care. I'm very pleased.

This is exactly what my husband needed, didnt even knew existed till I did a search on Amazon. H e has had some cancer cells cut out of nose and has had precancer cells, so it is very important he has nose covered. He always wears a large brimmed hat but this adds extra protection. He golfs, runs, fishes and this works perfectly. Suncreen always sweated off and had to reapply numerous times. This is peace of mind. attached to glasses with no problem and has never fallen off even when jogging

eos-eos

Update: I had left a quite negative review, and discarded the product. not expecting anything further. But based solely on the review, the CooNESS people proactively issued a refund as if I had returned them. Quite impressive service! I will look for their products in the coming months. They went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied with the overall experience, even though I did not like the Nose Guards

Must have for long distance open motorcycle ride üëçüòé

I just had surgery on my nose and my doctor suggested I purchase these uv nose shields , after reading the negative reviews, I was hesitant to purchase them. However I pulled the nipple tip all the way through successfully secured the nose piece onto my glasses, if you don't pull it through completely the nipple tip will come out. You get 4 pieces for 25$ which I think is great value for what you spend, not a fashion item but a must have if you need nose protection from the sun.

I'm new to cycling and really concerned with the amount of sun exposure I get after removing a skin cancer from my nose with the MOHS procedure that is really painful. This product is the only one I could find that provides 100% UV protection and peace of mind when I'm cycling under the sun for so many hours. Sunscreen doesn't stay on for long with all the sweating. It fits really well to my sun glasses. Highly recommend to those in a similar situation, its much better to look funny than to give chance to skin cancer on your nose!

I love the CoolNES UV nose guards! The size and the shape and the stiffness of the plastic is perfect! The clasp that goes over the sunglasses bridge is perfect because it is so secure.The variety of the four colors allows you to accessorize any sunglasses.For me, since I am undergoing radiation on my nose, I need maximum safe protection while driving, in the gym, while outside. These are great!

eos-eos

I like the fit and the feel of the nose covering. Fits well with sunglasses with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sized nosepiece. Doesn‚Äôt fit with sunglasses that are worn over regular glasses; Nosepiece is too large. Great to pop this product on and know that my Schnoz is well protected.

eos-eos

They are a good cover for nose if you have had skin cancer or are prone to have it. They do stay attached to the glasses if they are attached correctly. Very comfortable, you actually forget they are on

eos-eos

Great product, easy to use, once you pull the tip of the clip all the way through the hole its totally secure. I always read reviews and I was not sure what to expect about these nose shields. The packaging could explain better how to pull through the attachment, light, soft, perfect for all my glasses. I have had skin issues on my nose and the dermatologist suggest I purchase a nose shield when spending time outdoors. I have tried other products but for the price these are great. 4 peaces in 1 pack. Highly recommend. I love their neck masks also, thanks CoolNES!

Been looking for this type of guard for some time. Could not believe how soft and comfortable it is. Also that you can trim it if it is too big. Just recently had cancer surgery on my nose . Found this cover soft enough to ware .

eos-eos

It is so comfortable and my sunglasses hold it on. Recently had an operation to remove a skin cancer so need to protect nose while it heals. Also to make sure I don't get another one when out in sun.

eos-eos

Better than I had hoped.  Not hard plastic and instead feel like silicone.  Easy to cut if you prefer them smaller or less wide.  Easy to clip over and then attach to sun glasses.  A bit pricey (I paid $20 for 4) however they feel good and work well so "worth" it to me and I'd buy them again.

Sunscreen lotion tends to cause pimples on my nose. Sore, and burned aren‚Äôt great. The CoolNES nose ‚Äúboot‚Äù has been perfect and non-irritating. They stay put on my shades and are easy to clean. Recommended (by a landscape contractor).

Not beautiful, but great sun protection- prevent skin cancer - great for when I bicycle or go fishing for long periods of time! Live in the US southwest the sun here can be brutal!

This product worked great for my husband who had skin cancer removed from his nose. Also, this companies customer service is great too! Our pkg was short one nose piece and they immediately took care of the situation. I highly recommend this product.

Amazing product! It projects my nose and I like that there is one then more so I can put them on regular and my running glasss.

Not cool! But works, had a mole removed and dermatologist suggested I buy these coolnes nose guards, my dad loves it for fishing :) 4 come in a pack!

Very comfortable and easy to use. I live in Florida, I manage my skin cancer with everything the Doctors (They love this) tell me to do and this is a great, easy, comfortable way for me to be out doors (On the boat and at the beach) and have the peace of mind that my nose is covered. I am asked all the time, "Where did you buy that", from people at the beach, Capt. Hiram's Resort, Marina and restaurant, in Sebastian Fl,.

eos-eos

Bought because of pre-cancer on the nose bridge. As other reviewers said the tie piece may not be long enough. I used a small piece of Glide dental floss to tie it together (works great).

eos-eos

I believe Silicone is better than plastic, in terms of environmental impact. And these are soft.

eos-eos

I have read all the reviews and i was hesitating to buy this 4 pack, i think people are not pulling through the ‚Äúnipple‚Äù all the way, for this reason they are giving this product 1 stars, i love it, i had skin issues ob my nose and it works great with all my glasses, highly recomend, thanks

eos-eos

I like how easily you can add sun protection to your glasses. I literally followed the one sentence instructions on the box and I was in business. I also like how much sun protection these offer as they cover a large area of my face! My only concern would be breathability as they are made from something like Silicon.. not sure how that will work out yet.

eos-eos

Very comfortable and easy to apply to your frames.

If you live in Miami this is a most to buy, great quality and it doesn‚Äôt bother on your nose, but most important your glasses don't get foggy. Definitely I will buy it again.

I bought these to use with a mask to give me more breathing room without inhaling my mask. It works pretty well for when I need to wear the mask for extended amounts of time.

I was surprised how they stay fit. Even work with flip turns sometimes. Otherwise, they stay in place.

To protect against sun, this product does the job exceptionally well. In the winter cold, however, it would be helpful if the product was also made with some form of insulation on the underside of the nosepiece.

Just PERFECT - we use the CoolNES when we are exercising - PERFECT protection from the hot Florida sun

Great for anyone with a sensitivity to sun. Covers nicely. Very soft and flexible. Stays in place while on motorcycle with the help of sunglasses or helmet shield.
