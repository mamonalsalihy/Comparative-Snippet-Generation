This product worked great for my husband who had skin cancer removed from his nose. Also, this companies customer service is great too! Our pkg was short one nose piece and they immediately took care of the situation. I highly recommend this product.

The Coolnes nose shield is an ingenious product that fits securely and really protects your nose. I recently had surgery for skin cancer on my beak and the new skin is still extremely sensitive to the sun. Eight weeks from the skin graft, the skin on the tip of my nose remained red and scabbed even with only brief daily exposure to the sun -- I feared I'd get skin cancer all over again. Within 2-3 weeks of using the nose shield, which has 50+ UV protection and I used repeatedly with long exposure outside here in Denver, no more scabs and my nose looks more or less normal. I'll keep wearing the guard most of the time for awhile yet outside just to be safe, as I'm happy to resemble Groucho Marx until my nose has a tan.  Coolnes is also a generous company. In the package of 4 nose shields, they include an invitation to get another package of their products for free. This free package includes a second set of 4 nose shields, a package of 4 red masks with ear attachments, and yet another package of 4 different-colored neck bands that keep your glasses & masks from falling to the ground. All of these items have UV50+ protection. Very cool!  I highly recommend this company and its products. Especially the nose shield!

Sunscreen lotion tends to cause pimples on my nose. Sore, and burned aren‚Äôt great. The CoolNES nose ‚Äúboot‚Äù has been perfect and non-irritating. They stay put on my shades and are easy to clean. Recommended (by a landscape contractor).

I like the fit and the feel of the nose covering. Fits well with sunglasses with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sized nosepiece. Doesn‚Äôt fit with sunglasses that are worn over regular glasses; Nosepiece is too large. Great to pop this product on and know that my Schnoz is well protected.

These were a waste of money. The little prong does not stay in the hole so the nose protector does not stay on your nose.

I love the CoolNES UV nose guards! The size and the shape and the stiffness of the plastic is perfect! The clasp that goes over the sunglasses bridge is perfect because it is so secure.The variety of the four colors allows you to accessorize any sunglasses.For me, since I am undergoing radiation on my nose, I need maximum safe protection while driving, in the gym, while outside. These are great!

I have had skin cancer on my nose. This was easy to use and offers more protection than sunscreen. I wish it came in a shorter size though. It made drinking out of a glass difficult due to it‚Äôs length.
