This product is not very good for POC. This white cast made my skin look like one of the gross sisters off the Proud Family. üòÇ

UPDATE: I have been using this while gardening and walking for a few months now. Normally I am the kind of white person who turns into a sad lobster after 15 minutes. I can now be out in the sun for several hours, and just turn pink. Yeah, I try to stand under trees and wear a stupid big hat. But the fact that I can BE OUTSIDE IN DAYLIGHT... FOR HOURS... This stuff is quite powerful.  I had almost given up on finding a facial sunblock and resigned myself to staying inside (ugh.) Chemical sunscreens make my eyes burn and water even to have an open bottle near me, and the other mineral ones I've tried have been ok on my body, but on my face... ew. Chalky and also greasy and heavy. This one 1. doesn't burn, even though I bravely put some on my eyelids! 2. goes on chalky, but blends in with my chalky winter complexion. And honestly, if it turned me lavender with teal spots, I wouldn't care, because... 3. it doesn't feel any heavier than wearing a BB cream! Which is admittedly heavier than I like, but still light enough to tolerate. And I went out in the winter sun and snow-glare and I didn't get a burnt face, so it works!  Seriously, I don't want to turn anyone off because I said it was chalky. It faded in about 30 seconds with minimal rubbing. I made my husband examine my face up close (poor dear) and he asked, "Did you put on makeup? It looks nice." (No, but points for effort.)

I absolutely adore this mineral SPF. I'm a brown skin girl (shade 420 in Fenty, for reference) & it doesn't leave a cast. It also doesn't have that weird zinc smell. I can reapply this and not look like Tyrone from The Chappelle show LOL.

I‚Äôm a 26 year old guy with fair, normal skin. I apply this SPF every single day over a serum and moisturizer. I have light, fair skin (aka I‚Äôm super white) and I do not experience a white cast. I sometimes use a natural, non-toxic, self tanner and even when I‚Äôm ‚Äúsuper tan‚Äù from that I still don‚Äôt experience any white cast.  I purchased this product as it was recommended on EWG for being non-toxic and very effective at UVA/UVB protection. I‚Äôd highly recommend it and it is my replacement for Elta MD as that unfortunately is toxic. I use it daily and will continue to do so for years to come.

Amazing!! Absolutely amazing sunscreen. I am of Indian origin and usually burn in the sun. However, this product completely protected me and does not leave ANY WHITE CAST. This is a wonderful product for the face, but due to its price I would not apply it on the body. Expensive but worth it!!

I purchased this product through the Biossance website and used it twice. On the second day, I got a horrible red rash with whiteheads like blemishes/boils all over my face. If you look in the Sephora community forum, many people have had the same reaction. It is very painful and concerning. I do have sensitive skin, but thought I could try this one because it is EGW certified and Biossance markets it as good for sensitive skin. I wished I had read the Sephora community comments prior to using. If you do use this product, patch test first! Even if you don't have sensitive skin. This is a serious reaction, not a mild irritation. My doctor had to prescribe heavy duty medicines to help me heal. It is day 3, and I have still not recovered. I tried to post my experience on the review page of the Biossance website, but they have yet to publish it. I suppose I don't blame them for not wanting this graphic image of my face blemishing their pretty website with celebrities and glass bottles against beautiful nature backdrops.

Still leaves a gray/white cast on darker skin. I‚Äôve given up on trying to find a physical sunscreen

not all sunscreen smells like 'sunscreen' and leaves your face looking like a greasy ghost?! wasn't brought into that secret until now!!  i was skeptical at first because of the price point, but was recommended this product so i decided to give it a go. it's amazing!! i've never experienced a sunscreen quite like it and honestly didn't know it existed. i've always just dealt with the smelly, greasy sunscreens at the drug store because i thought that is just how it is but now that i have this product i will gladly pay $30 without blinking an eye at another sunscreen again.  i have an olive complexion and have no difficulty with white cast. it does have one when first applied but once i rub it in - nothing! i also use it on my daughter who has dark skin and have had the same results.  one thing to point out though - it is harder to apply makeup over top of it (wasn't as smooth as it normally is) and leaves it looking a bit cakey after a few hours.

Previously, I was using the sunburn tinted mineral sunscreen and the lotz tinted mineral primer sunscreen. They made my skin look absolutely amazing - blurring/mattifying effect. However, they were incredibly drying. They especially made my under eyes super dry. Yikes!  So, I finally bought this.  And, I can say this is my new favorite mineral sunscreen of all time. It's moisturizing and blends in perfectly. I honestly can't even tell if I put sunscreen on myself. This sunscreen is absolutely perfect for people with medium to dry skin. The texture and feel reminds me of the Cosrx Aloe Sunscreen.  I'm sooo happy because it's incredibly hard to find the perfect mineral sunscreen when you have brown skin. Thank you biossance!

I‚Äôm tan and so far all drugstore physical sunscreens that claim to leave no white cast always leave a white cast on me! But this sunscreen is amazing. It is a little more pricey for the size but I‚Äôm okay with that now after trying it out for a couple of weeks. It only takes maybe 20 seconds of rubbing in for the white cast to completely disappear and the finish is dewy, just how I like it. I live in a humid place and in the past I had always added a moisturizer before my sunscreen, but this sunscreen is a little too moisturizing for that. It‚Äôs perfect without the added layer of moisturizer. I saw some reviews saying it has a sticky feel but I disagree, I mean you can definitely feel that there‚Äôs a layer of sunscreen on your face since it‚Äôs a physical sunscreen, but it‚Äôs not a bother for me personally. Also, my skin tends to be sensitive to new products, but this hasn‚Äôt caused me to break out or have any irritation at all. The only problem I can think of is the packaging. The sunscreen pools a bit in the cap. But aside from the packaging this product is a 10/10.

I‚Äôm shocked by the negative reviews on here, particularly the one‚Äôs who say they caused a skin reaction, because this is the ONLY face sunscreen I‚Äôve ever liked (and I also have HIGHLY sensitive skin and get nervous to try new products)! I literally look forward to putting it on every day! It‚Äôs so lightweight, moisturizing (my skin typically dries out so bad from other sunscreen) and not too matte but not too shiny either. It‚Äôs helped clear up most of my acne (AMAZING because I‚Äôve tried ALL the acne things!) and the normal face redness I‚Äôve had for years. I‚Äôm continuously complimented on my skin now which has always previously been my biggest insecurity. I‚Äôm obsessed! So take other reviews with a grain of salt. Patch test if you‚Äôre worried about reacting, but I think it‚Äôs worth a shot for everyone to feel more confident and protected!

Because Beet the Shield by KraveBeauty was not available, I have been using this everyday for the past several months now. I really like it! I have medium to dark (I‚Äôm S. Asian), DRY skin. Now, this isn‚Äôt sheer as a chemical sunscreen, but it‚Äôs pretty near invisible. And I love how hydrating it is. This might be too much for someone with an oiler skin, though. I am trying out the Pippette sunscreen (I think they share the same parent company) since it‚Äôs cheaper than Biossance. However, the Pippette is not as sheer as this one so I will probably go back to Biossance as soon I am done with the Pippette.

Hi, this sunscreen was purchased for my daughter after she seen a youtuber suggesting top rated sunscreens. she is very happy with it and will continue to use it.

Review from the wife: I recently did a lot of research on a better skincare routine. This brand and specifically this sunscreen came up several times with rave reviews. I have to say, I was not disappointed! It is a super light formula that goes on very smooth and leaves you moisturized but not greasy. I will definitely be purchasing again!

eos-eos

I am allergic to the chemical sunscreens and have struggled to find a sunscreen that will not leave my skin white. This product is expensive but it absorbs easily with no white cast.

eos-eos

It‚Äôs unfortunate to have to pay this much for a quality sunscreen, but worth it! No white cast or traditional sunscreen smell. Lightweight. A must buy!

eos-eos

I really like this facial sunscreen. It is a great for anyone who is acne prone and looking for a ‚Äúclean beauty‚Äù (brand that excludes harmful ingredients) option. It is a zinc based sunscreen but is sheer on me (I am white) and rubs in easily. It is moisturizing which is great for my normal to dry acne prone skin. I think this sunscreen would be good to try for any skin type.

eos-eos

I use it mostly on the backs of my hands before walking or driving. It disappears quickly. But I have fair skin, so this may be an individual assessment. Otherwise, I like that it has mostly safe ingredients, no obnoxious aroma, and is easy to use and carry as needed.

eos-eos

This product is not sticky and does not make my face look white from the lotion. It is very shear and feels like a normal moisturizer instead of a mineral suncreen.

eos-eos

Had to try this after JVN raved about it on a podcast. I agree with him that this is the face sunscreen to have if you MUST have mineral. While pass sheer than chemical sunscreen it is very nice for mineral. Pricey though, so won‚Äôt be in my wheelhouse for everyday use.

eos-eos

I absolutely love this sunscreen!! No white cast! Great protection. Goes on very smooth and a little goes a long way. Doesn‚Äôt pill under makeup..non-nano, reef friendly. Very good ingredients. Definitely will repurchase this and it is worth the money. I will buy from website next purchase you get better deals.

I have been looking for a mineral sunscreen that does not pill when applying makeup. Previously, I was using EltaMD sunscreen, but it pulls something awful when you go and put on your foundation. This does not, and it also does not leave a heavy white cast after application. A bit pricey for the amount, but I highly recommend it!

I am 24 years old with dry, sensitive skin, used this for a year now to combat premature wrinkles and sun damage. Perfect sunscreen. No white cast, moisturizing, lightweight, great under makeup, not much of a scent. I just find when I rub my eyes at any point of the day, they start to burn because sunscreen residue gets in them.

eos-eos

Checks all the boxes for moisturizing, all natural, mineral sunscreen. EGW certified and doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin. Has a nice gel consistency out of the bottle, not heavy thick cream like most mineral sunscreens. Was easy to rub in and left no white cast (even on or around dark facial hair!).

eos-eos

Great product. I bought it in store originally and was worried that buying offline was going to be a mistake but its the same product! Great dewy look and its light weight enough that its doesn‚Äôt pill or leave any residue. It does have a bit of a white cast, but otherwise is my favorite product all around!

Best sunscreen for poc. I am south asian olive toned and have been using it for more than a year now. Its a good everyday moisturizer and does not leave a white cast!

Really incredible product! Is super lightweight and also is vegan. Extremely moisturizing too.  Only downside is I wish there was more sunscreen in what you buy.

eos-eos

Very impressed. With my medium brown complexion I didn't have much hope, but it's sheer and lightweight as advertised.

As a runner, I appreciate a light weight sun screen lotion and this meets my needs perfectly.

I bought this for a trip to the bvi. Let all requirements and it goes on sheer and doesn‚Äôt leave white marks on my bathing suit. Didn‚Äôt irritate my skin and kept me from burning.

It's so hard to find a mineral sunscreen that has good ingredients and leaves no white cast. I think this is the one! My daughter and I both really like it! I wish they make one that's water resistant for swimming. I would totally get that as well!

I love this product! it‚Äôs moisturizing but not too heavy. it doesn‚Äôt leave that much of a white sheen.

eos-eos

First sunscreen That didn‚Äôt make me to brake up. The skin does look shiny kinda oily; however it doesn‚Äôt feel weird or heavy it‚Äôs really light weight and with a little is more than enough. Don‚Äôt be scared and buy the smallest one so you could try it first and see how it works in your own skin.

I love this sunscreen. Doesn't leave a white streak and lasts all day. I only apply a dot in each cheek, one on the forehead, and one on the chin. After rubbing it in, that's all you need. Highly recommend!

I had used another brand for years but this Biossance delivers sheer mineral sunscreen coverage. Will not use any other. Thanks for a great product.

I like how lightweight it feels on my skin and does not leave any white cast. This the one of safetest mineral everyday sunscreen I trust based on the EWG list as one of the safetest sunscreen that provides both UVA and UVB broad spectrum protection.

I live in south Florida and have to wear sunscreen every day. This is my go to! Lightweight, moisturizing and makeup goes over it beautifully.

Love everything about this as a black girl absolutely no white cast no matter the amount. Easy to rub it in

This is a sheer, clean sunscreen that moisturizes instead of being greasy. Don‚Äôt apply too thick and allow 10 minutes to absorb before applying make-up.

My girlfriend says this is the best one. I bought this for her for Valentine‚Äôs Day and I still can‚Äôt get her to stop eating it

Excellent for sensitive skin, best sunscreen I have ever used!! It moisturizes my skin and doesn‚Äôt make me oily!

I was somewhat reluctant about this at first due to the price point, but it is so worth it! Spend the money! You will not be disappointed! The only small qualm I have about the sunscreen is it can run a bit in the heat. I do live in the dirty south (East Texas), so understandably stuff happens due to our humidity. It leaves my skin SO soft-almost like using a moisturizer.

Does not leave a white cast!! On black skin alot of sunscreen make you look like a ghost but this one doesn't Will buy again

I‚Äôm sold. I‚Äôve tried several clean facial sunscreens, and this one is a WINNER! No white cast, no weird smell, it‚Äôs PERFECT!

I have medium to tan skin and this sunscreen went on smoothly and didn‚Äôt leave a white cast on my skin, which is a big deal for mineral sunscreens. I mixed it with my daily CC tinted cream which went on even better.
