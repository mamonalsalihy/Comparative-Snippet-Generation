I saw other reviews that said this product was hard to put on, looked pasty-white, shiny. This is not at all what I've found with this sunscreen product. It goes on semi-clear, smooth, non-greasy, easy to rub in. I compared it with the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Soft-Touch 50, and the CereVe works better for me. It's easier to put on, it's more hydrating than the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc and doesn't make me look pasty-white. The Neutrogena is thicker and harder to put on smoothly, but it's got a higher amount of zinc oxide, whereas CereVe has titanium dioxide as well as zinc oxide. I apply my sunscreen every hour when I'm outside so the size tube could be smaller to fit into my pocket or fanny pack, but I'll still find a way to carry it with me. I like it and I know I'll use it. I'll still use the Neutrogena product in certain situations, but I think my go-to sunscreen from now on will be the CeraVe. I was not given any product nor was I paid for this. It's just my opinion from using both products.

Don’t waste your money. I’m not sure if this product just doesn’t work for Black ppl or it just doesn’t work at all. It dried up on my skin, wasn’t easy to rub in, and left an awful white caste on my skin.

I love Cerave skin lotion for my face, but this stuff...... Absolute crap, I think think this was invented as a seriously screwed up practical joke. When you apply it and rub it in on and into your face (or so you think you are rubbing it in) it leaves a slight white haze that you can live with because you think the rest will just absorb in. That’s when Cerave starts to giggle at you. Within 20 minutes of applying it comes back out giving you a deathly pale look about you AND now the product is full out laughing at you. . My story: In my extremely well lit bathroom I applied liberally because I burn easily, got it to a point of not having too much white junk on my face that I could live with and hopped on my motorcycle to meet my guys for a ride. Got to the first destination spot within 20 minutes and was met with laughter and taunts of being called Dr. Evil. I can take a joke because I give them too so it’s part of the game with my friends, but I refuse to walk around with this crap on my face making me look like a corpse.

Just goes on white and stays white. For a while. Don’t know if it helps with the sun blocking but it sure good for your next performance at birthday parties! Great for clowning! Rough and dry to smear on. Itches. But you end up happy or sad. Depending on what clown you like to be.

It feels nice, but it looks terrible! The first time I applied “liberally” as per instructions (maybe a third of a teaspoon), and it looked like I was wearing white face paint. I saw the other review for this product and tried again with less product, but as I kept rubbing it did fade, but also microexfoliated my face and sort of crumbled, so it looks kind of cakey and I’m still much paler. I’m already pretty pale but this is quite noticeable. This would REALLY not work for anyone who isn’t very very fair in skin tone. It does *feel* much nicer than any other sunscreen I’ve used, so two stars.

My dermatologist recommended CeraVe sunscreen 50 SPF for my face following blue light treats for skin cancer. I have been using it for the past two weeks. The product is very thick and has to be rubbed in completely or it leaves a pinkish film on your face. I am very pleased with the results after using this cream. Better than most other sunscreen products.

I have been using this sunscreen for years and was excited to see it offered on Amazon.  To the reviewers who complain that it has an ashy cast, you must understand that zinc and titanium oxide are made from a white powder, so there is absolutely no way to make the sunscreen go on clear if you use any type of true mineral-based liquid sunscreen. The best way to try and blend this sunscreen as much as possible is to warm it in your hands and apply small amounts in sections on your face. It actually works best of you let your moisturizer sink in, put the sunscreen on and let it sit on your face for a few moments so it doesn't peel.  The new dispenser is great, as it has a smaller opening so the sunscreen doesn't squeeze out a huge application. As an individual who has sensitive skin and wears sunscreen everyday, this product has been awesome at keeping my skin from breaking out and protecting it from the sun.

eos-eos

It has pretty strong white cast. I went about 2 shades lighter than my normal skin tone with this on. It was also very thick and somewhat difficult to rub in. Although makeup applies nicely over the top of it and I didnt have any cakeyness or creasing. It did though almost act as a primer and it melted my powers to make them look more like skin which was a plus. If you have oily skin it might just make you look shinny... but anything to protect me from the sun.

I ordered this product, after I received a sample from my dermatologist. Best protection product I've ever used. There were some nagative reviews, because it goes on white, and a thick application may stay white. However it depends on your individual needs. I am fair skinned and in my late 50s, and just recently was diagnosed with Basel Cell Carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, on my nose and face. I need a product for sun block and protection. I want it caked on white and to stay white, for blockage (clear poduct on the best blockage) and does not easily sweat off, rub off, or lose its effectiveness. So for me, somebody who needs to protect my face from harmful rays, here on out, and I am not too proud to cake it on, and have a slightly white nose, when I am doing yard work, playing golf, or other outside activites. If you are concerned about appearance, then maybe not for you. But if you are concerned about protecting your skin, although may not look attractive, this prouduct may be for you. I have yet to have a burn on my face, with proper application. Wished they had this 20 years ago.

I wanted to love this badly because Cerave is EVERYTHING to my skin! I use multiple products from this brand for my face and body and love them all.  This, on the other hand -- if you have even a drop of melanin in your skin, you will get an ashen pinkish/purplish hue, almost corpse-like. This is my result, and this is RUBBED IN. Skip this product.

eos-eos

This is my favorite facial sunscreen. It leaves a slight white cast on even my light ivory skin, so careful for those with darker skin unless you wear makeup on top of it. It does not pill under makeup and moisturizes well. It doesn’t make me breakout on my sensitive skin. I’m just disappointed that the one I got had an expiration date only 2 months away. I guess it’s technically not a big deal since I’m in the middle of the hot summer and will likely use it all. But I have no choice but to order online since I never see this in stores. So just don’t go ordering multiple ones at once keeping the expiration date issue in mine, that I’ve seen in other reviews too.

So a lot of complaints say this doesn't spread and leaves a white case. I can say I was super disappointed as well. To be fair the description warns you about this applying a small amount at a time and rubbing it in well to prevent this. If that still leaves a white cast, its because it's 100% mineral based, but don't worry, i got you sis.  Take a dab of cerave, and a dab of face lotion(maybe cerave face lotion), and mix it on your fingers. Problem solved!! I admittedly don't use a ton of sunblock, but i do use enough that even with this technique I still have a SLIGHT white hue. Not as noticeable before and perfectly acceptable in day to day life!!! I no longer feel like a clown

My grandson has sensitive skin, he'll break out in a rash from random things. But he also loves being outside and doing fun things. He has eczema, a very light case now, but it's been an issue. Regular sun blocks would protect him from the sun, but he would also break out because of the lotion. He was have bumps or sometimes just a red irritated look for a day or two after using sun block. My daughter had tried just about all the brands.  Someone told me that CeraVe had sun block and it was great. My daughter had no idea they made sun block, but she was familiar with their lotion, because it was always the best in combating his eczema. So I sent her a tube and it's amazing. He doesn't break out at all! It is quite thick, and takes a bit to soak in - so there may be a white sheen on the skin for a bit... but its well worth it.

Okay. I'm coming after everyone who says it sucks I'm pale as the snow so of course the white cast doesn't show. If you have darker skin tones please get a different one

All PHYSICAL sunscreen will be difficult to spread and leave a white tint behind. The active ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are also pigments that make white paint. Rather than the chemical UV protectants (like oxybenzone) that soak into the skin and get into your blood, these sit on the surface and eventually fall off.  I am a chemist and a burn survivor that happened from a fire at work. While I'm healing, UV exposure has the threat of leaving my affected skin permanently discolored. This means that I have to wear sunscreen everyday, and putting traditional sunscreen on daily would increase my exposure to oxybenzone and oxycrylene, which is why I am using this product and I'm glad it has a moisturizing effect as well!

eos-eos

If you want to look like this after applying the instructed amount of sunscreen, feel free to spend your money on it. It was my first disappointing product from Cerave.

eos-eos

I love this product! When I read the reviews I was concerned with some that posted that the product would make you look pale, etc. I thought I would give it a try anyway. I use it on my face when I walk in the AMs. It disappears after I apply it and it protect me very well. I had a small bit of cancer on my nose and after having it removed, the doctor recommended that I use a good sunscreen. I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.

My skin is light olive and this product surprisingly blends pretty well and is not garishly "white". The lotion/cream is medium-thick so requires dabbing it on in spots around your face, then patting and blending it in. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it blended. There is a slight sheer white sheen initially, but it goes invisible as your body warms it up. It's lightweight as they claim and it is not greasy feeling. With the added ceramides and niacinamide my face never feels dry. I'm glad Cerave made this SPF 50 and will always have it on hand. I've learned late in life that sunscreen is absolutely necessary to maintain a smooth textured and spot free skin and will use this product to best advantage. I prefer using the mineral screen over the chemical one because we already face a world with way too many chemicals already.

I apply this in the morning as the last step of my skincare routine. It usually is sitting on top of my vit c serum, eye serum, eye balm, and a day cream like grown alchemist's day cream.  I have dry/dehydrated/sensitized acne prone skin. I love that this product spreads easily and blends in nicely. It doesn't give me that lavender cast that many mineral formulations can leave behind on fair skin. The price point makes this a great everyday option for me and I haven't noticed any acne or eczema flare ups from this product. Would definitely recommend.

eos-eos

I bought this sunscreen after reading the ingredient list multiple times. I was shocked to find out that this cream was both mineral-based and didn't use oil as a binder. I am someone that can't stand chemical sunblock and it's chemicals that can be just as damaging as UV rays themselves, but every other sunscreen I tried that has zinc turns so oily on my skin that I might as well have dipped my face in canola oil after sweating for 5 minutes. Not only does this STAY on your face, but it also doesn't change consistency to a gooey, oily, mess! For a comparison, it has the consistency of the Eucerine Daily protection, but less chemicals. It does leave a white cast, be warned, but if you blend it well enough, it will look like you have a "soft focus" effect from a photo app going on, if that makes sense. The only things that would have made this product better is if 1. It came in a larger size ( who doesn't always request that ? ) and 2. If it were cruelty free.

eos-eos

Works well but I have others I prefer more. I have a friend with fair skin and he let me use this. He loves it. Never burns with it on. It does leave white on your face but provides a good block. I used his when I visited him in Nevada and had to buy more since we brought his home in our suitcase. Had to replace his-wouldn't want him to burn. So, I still have a partial tube. He now has the new one. I live in a sunshine state and use sunscreen a lot but prefer to just cover up with a hat. I don't think I would use this again if I had a more better alternative made more for women. I've used Image Skincare, Obaji, No 7 (concealer with sunscreen which I love) and now Coola (love this too). I would buy this for the guys in my house who are just looking for a block and don't mind having white show up on their face. Hope this helps.

Finally, a sunscreen I can trust to protect the sensitive eczema-prone skin on my face. It's very moisturizing, has a very subtle scent, and really protects. However, it is not light or sheer. In fact, I would describe it as "heavy" and "creamy." It's heavy enough that it actually lends a sort of pale cast to your skin when you're wearing it. This is worth it for me when I need real sun protection, more than just a moisturizer with SPF. I was previously using the Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer in SPF 50. It is more sheer, but gets slimy and stings my eyes when I'm really sweating (like in an outdoor workout or at the pool). This is now my go-to sunscreen for any outdoor activity. It works, it lasts, it moisturizes, and my sensitive skin doesn't mind it.

I am 52 yrs old and have Lupus and eczema, so I must use a mineral sunscreen and still can have allergic reactions. This is the ONLY sunscreen out of the dozens I've used that I have had no bad reaction to!!!! It moisturizes my skin and the sunblock works perfectly!!! This is very thick and white, so I use it as primer and spf. Once foundation is applied over this, after this has absorbed (30 seconds), the white cast is undetectable and my skin appears smoother, no pores!!!! I will continue to purchase this as long as they make it.

eos-eos

I like Cera Ve products very much, and this is excellent sunblock with both titanium dioxide and zinc. If you really want to protect your skin, you need both these ingredients. Having said that, it does leave your skin with a whitish sheen, so if you're more worried about how it looks than superior sun protection, you may not like it. Also, it has a slight chemical odor to it. I don't mind any of that because I'm far more concerned about a recurring case of skin cancer than I am anything else. I will continue to purchase it. I'm happy they improved their formula and that the increased the size of the tube so you don't have to buy it so often. Good price if you want excellent sun protection.

I love this sunscreen, and with fair skin that is easily prone to burning, I have to wear a serious sunscreen all the time. This does the trick. Some people may not like the fact that it isn't totally transparent and does show up as white on the skin. I don't mind and expect that from a mineral based sunscreen that truly blocks out the harmful rays. The most important thing for me is protection, and this product delivers.

eos-eos

This goes on easily, feels great, moisturizes, and most importantly protects me from the sun. I have very sensitive, porcelain skin. This does the trick without anything in it that can cause cancer!!

Several years ago I became seriously sensitive to chemical-based sunscreens. I bought several mineral-based sunscreens but they were all very thick and looked terrible when applied. I love CeraVe products so I bought some of their sunscreen. It is much creamier than the previous ones I’ve tried, and applies easier. Very happy with the CeraVe sunscreen.

This sunscreen is best for people with light skin. I use it everyday. My daughter is olive skinned and tan and it leaves too much chalky cast for her. For me it works beautifully. It protects me from the sun, moisturizes my skin really well and doesn’t irritate my face at all. I recommend it if your skin is fair enough to handle the zink cast, it is unnoticeable on me but very distracting on my darker skinned daughter

I love this product but be careful not to put to much on. Trust me when I say a little bit goes a long way. Works really well. Not sticky at all very smooth on skin and has a nice texture. I highly recommend to buy this product.

Thai has great and healthy protection from the sun. I’m a big sun believer and love getting Vit D, but your face is a terrible place to get it 😂 It does have a bit of a whitish caste to it which is to be expected with mineral sunscreen. But it’s not bad and is fine. I use .025 Tretinoin (Retin A) every evening (because I’m almost 50!) so I need good sun protection when I’m outside.

My dermatologist recommended this brand. Is a bit lighter and easier to spread than the body cream. I like that it has no smell and is not as thick as other sunscreens. Holds up well but reapply as per directions after swimming and after 2 hours. Their video on how to apply helps. Good product at reasonable price.

I have acne prone skin and this sunscreen is amazing. I've used Lancome and Clinique facial sunscreens for years (and at 3x the cost). I recently switched to Cerave and am very satisfied. I had no issues after several uses and the price is excellent for the high quality.

I’m on Curology for my acne and due to my skin being weakened by the treatment, I have to limit sun exposure to my face. This cream won over my heart. I love the smell and the feel of it. Great face protection!  Only con - make sure you spread it good across your face because the cream is extremely white unless it’s rubbed in thoroughly.

I use various CeraVe products and needed extra sun protection to use when going for runs. This sunblock is thick and has a sunblock scent (no added fragrance). It’s perfect for my skin-type (combo), I don’t break-out and I can sweat without it running. Pros: great skin protection and doesn’t block pores. Perfect for days outdoors. Cons: Thick but spreadable.

Make no mistake. This is for serious sun-blocking, and yes, it tends to leave a noticeable white film when it's applied. When I am exercising in hot, humid weather, this product does not burn the eyes when I sweat, and that makes it better than any of the sports sunscreens I have used.

Since it is mineral based, presumably not much danger of toxicity. No smell, but it does have you looking somewhat ghost like. Recent information indicates ingredients in most suntan lotions can cause cancer.

A very easy to spread, start off with a little to get a feel for how it spreads and absorbs. I found it's definitely moisturizing, but very white (I have an olive complexion). Will have to work it in a little, but even with a mild tinted foundation, my complexion was smooth and color neutral.

I’ve used several CeraVe products and have never been disappointed. I especially like their CeraVe eczema/anti-itch cream. The sunscreen goes a long way as you don’t need but a little bit.

My dermatologist recommended the entire product line and she was right they work as advertised.

Does it turn your skin ghost white? Yes. Does it feel like you're wearing a rubber mask? Kind of. Do you feel super-well protected from the sun while you're at the beach? Heck, yeah.
