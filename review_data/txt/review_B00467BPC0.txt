I bought these to give away as volunteer gifts for horse shows. They are perfect! Very cost effective compared to anything else I could find.

I purchased this multipack to put in “goody bags” for our upcoming family vacation. The size is perfect for traveling and those who are flying, and it’s convenient to toss in a beach bag. The texture and sun protection is what you’d from Banana Boat.

We put these in gift bags for our staff. Perfect for travel.

We bought these for our guests welcome bags. Everyone appreciated a little extra SPF at our wedding Turks and Caicos. Great price. Tried to find a better deal for bulk and couldn't. We paired this with travel size aloe as well.

I ordered the sunscreen for a bike blessing my church is involved in. I like the size and have used the product before so it was easy to decide what to order.

Super convenient. Since I moved to FL we keep these in a bowl near the door for ourselves or guests as we run out to the pool/beach. I always keep one in my car too.

Since we were getting married in the Riviera Maya, Mexico, we wanted to provide sun protection for our guests and so we put one in each of our guests welcome bags. It worked out great. The items arrived on time and in excellent condition in a plastic tub, so that they were not punctured or squeezed.

This is one of the rare cases where small is better. When I go hiking, I don't want a 6oz tube. I want a 1oz tube in my backpack. The 1oz size was hard to get in my city so I opted for a case of 24 and have been giving them as presents to fellow hikers on my walks.

These were great! I ordered them for a picnic-themed bridal shower I hosted, and paired them with ArtNaturals Mosquito Repellant Bracelets, then displayed them in a picnic basket. Everyone loved them!  ArtNaturals Mosquito Repellent Bracelets  ArtNaturals Mosquito Repellent Bracelets

I leave these tubes everywhere, ant take one everywhere. I use it for dry skin in winter. I no longer feel a physical burning sensation when others expect me to go outside. It has changed my life.

Good buy for the money. Perfect to carry in purse or on a bike.

Perfect solution to family outing to the beach to make sure everyone has sun protection. It even had a container we put on the counter so people could take their own.

We had a work event where we had clients on a yacht to watch the America's Cup races in SF. I had gift bags for all the clients and we included the travel sunscreen. They worked perfectly! I am very satisfied with the product.

I am head of our teachers Association and we decided to use these as unique gifts for teacher appreciation week in May. We wanted something that no one would think of and we can't wait to share them with others. The response was so quick and everything came just as described. It's really going to make a sunny teacher appreciation week for all of us.

My husband and I put these into our thank you bags for guests staying for our destination wedding. It was a lifesaver for some who never even thought to bring suntan lotion. The item came in time,and as scheduled. Thanks.
