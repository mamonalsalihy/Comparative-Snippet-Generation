This product did not work well. It was reapplied more than once. Four of the six people who used it ended up sun burned. I had to purchase something else. I will not purchase this item again.

What I needed

Been using for years on myself and my kids! Great for boating. Easy to apply.

I love this sunblock! Long lasting, protects against the sun and the spray is is so convenient to apply and re-apply. No white cast!

Utilizó el producto para el cuidado de mi piel, aunque ay que usar varias veces en el día para proteger, aroma bueno

Products and packaging arrived fine, but when I attempted to use the first time, the spray mechanism is broken. I’ve adjusted the nozzle but the quality is nonexistent. I tried to return to Amazon, but this product ineligible for return. FIGURES. Waste of money. Probably a waste to use this seller.

I really like that this is not a lotion or cream but a clear liquid. Non greasy but protects from UV very well.

Awesome protection and waterproof as it says

Not the first time I am using this which means it is a great product. The spray makes it so easier to put it on the body. The scent is a little too sharp for me, but other than that this is and always has been a solid product.

Good and easy to use
