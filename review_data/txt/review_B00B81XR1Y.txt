I've rated this one star because the title and text say it is "reef friendly" and "safe for use near natural reefs" but ALL of the active ingredients on the back are banned in the state of Hawaii as explicitly NOT reef safe. If you're using this sunscreen anywhere other than a pool, you may be damaging our ecosystems unintentionally. Lakes and rivers may be fine but not in the ocean where our reefs are being killed from the bleaching effects of the chemicals in sunscreens like this. Even if I didn't care about that (which I do) states like Hawaii and many other countries have banned the use of these chemicals, so it feels like an abject LIE to put "reef safe" on the label and heading of the product when it's clearly not!  This sunscreen may well work great at protecting skin from sunburns, but I'll never know because I can't use it. I'm also not able to return it because it's considered a flammable item to ship (though Amazon shipped it to me, so that makes no sense), so I am out the money I paid for these items.

I am a red head from Michigan who used this on a Caribbean cruise in December. Needless to say, by December any remnants of a summer tan were gone so I was back to a nice shade of pale. I applied it every day and came home with a nice, even tan. It was perfect for spraying on my back, and even the part in my hair. I usually always burn on the top of my head while swimming. This prevented burning and the subsequent embarrassing peeling. I did reapply after swimming for added protection. Great product!

This product is either counterfeit or factory seconds (or thirds) as it does not work! We have used this product in the past and like it. However, this time my wife and I had to apply the product (it seemed) every 30 minutes and it still didn‚Äôt work in preventing sunburn. In fact, I went and purchased a new can of the same stuff (from a brick-and-mortar store) the next day and it worked just fine. There is someone very wrong with this lot. Please remove this item for sale as they can cause injury since they don‚Äôt work!

ZERO stars from this family!! My children and I are walking around blistered and burned. I always wondered how anyone giving a review would want to give zero stars. Well, I wish I could and here‚Äôs why. This product is absolutely ineffective at preventing sunburns. I am a religious sunscreen user, especially when it comes to my children. While I had my usual sunscreen with me (coppertone sport SPF 30) I thought I would bring extra backup. Since my usual coppertone was out of stock, I purchased this banana boat sunscreen spf 30 which was an ‚Äúamazon‚Äôs choice.‚Äù The first day I was able to use what I had left of our coppertone sunscreen. A whole day in the river and not a single burn. We spent 2 days at the river. Little did I know that this banana boat sunscreen would completely fail my family and I on day 2. We applied every hour, whether we were in the water or not. I GENEROUSLY applied this product and waited for it to dry before my children returned to play in and out of the water. Just as I do with our other brand we usually use. I put my trust in this crap. Not only did it not work, my family and I both suffered from blistering burns from the tops of our feet all the way to the tips of our ears. ALL places that I religiously applied this banana boat sunscreen. How on EARTH can a product fail so badly at protecting its customers!? I‚Äôve included photos of my burns. If I were you, I would look twice at this product. Do not purchase it. I am living proof that you will be MISERABLE if you try to prevent sunburn with this product. I plan on returning What‚Äôs left (which isn‚Äôt much) of this faulty sunscreen for a refund. And I wish so badly that I had just hunted around for the coppertone. Never again will banana boat get a dime out of me. Don‚Äôt waste your money by sacrificing your precious skin. I hope I can save the people that read this review.  UPDATE: I am unable to return this product because it‚Äôs flammable. Go figure. I‚Äôm going to write Banana Boat directly and see if that makes any difference. But I still stand by my review. DO NOT BUY... unless you like sunburns.

I find the BB Sport 50 spray the best of the best sport sunscreen. It goes on dryer than Coppertone or Neutogena sprays with the same coverage and protection. I find it slips less when holding a racket or paddle and I apply it first spraying on my hands and then applying/rubbing it on to my face. I then spray directly onto the rest of my exposed skin and then rub it in before I go out and play. Excellent deal less than $7 a bottle.

Great product. Love that this is available in a twin pack. Easy to apply. I applied often ( maybe even more than reccomended ) but after multiple days in the Florida sun the product left me burn free. Still gives you a bit of color / tan keep in mind but it leaves no sun burn damage. This is my go to sun protectant and will be all I buy in the future. Also it‚Äôs priced well when purchased in the Twin pack.

This is literally the ONLY sunscreen that keeps my super pale skin from being burned, even when I forget to re apply!!! I have used 70 spf baby lotion sunscreen and burned after 20 minutes but not with this miracle spray! My kids have olive skin from their dad so they never burn but I still apply this on them and they never complain!

eos-eos

This sun screen is perfect for kids and works awesome! Its been 90+ degrees all month and with 4 little ones, I am constantly worries about them getting sun burned out all day in our pool. This is out of stock almost everywhere by me, and the few place that have sunblock have like doubled the price. So glad to find this as a low price and shipped to my door next day. Spray on is the way to go, so easy to apply and stays on even getting in and out of the water. Definitely recommend this!

eos-eos

Multiple skin tones as friends use it as well & no sunburns with this spray it's easy to apply its semi glossy but doesn't stay on greasy it doesn't wear off in the ocean easily. No white film left over it applies clear. Regardless we spray non stop while being in the sun for over 4 hours of hot summer days at a time. Locking mechanism is a plus & spray has never failed to work as well. Like how well & evenly spray comes out as well with a nice mist.

eos-eos

I love sunscreen mist because it's a quick and easy application (especially when you have kids that you have to put sunscreen on). It just takes a minute and VOILA! Done.  This one in particular smells better than others (in my opinion).  I don't use any spray on faces, because I don't want anyone breathing it in-- so I use the Banana Boat Sunscreen Stick for that.

Beware if your low on vitamin D. So apparently this stuff works at blocking the sun and uv light however I write this as a caution of using sunscreen if your low on vitamin d. I brought this in summer thinking I would like to protect myself from sun damage to my skin. I was apparently low in vitamin D and as I started using this daily, my best source of vitamin D came to an end. I started developing white hair, joint paint, nail growth reduction at first thinking it was due to aging I did not realize anything wrong until my hair thin and I develop a weird taste almost like medicine, or bitter in my mouth. As I still believe in sun protection I now take a vitamin for my daily vitamin D need.

I'm very light skinned and unprotected, burn, blister, and peel. I've been using this product for years and despite spending hours on the river on hot sunny days never gotten a burn. You won't get a tan, but you won't get a burn either.

eos-eos

I got this because it said it was reef safe on one of the pictures. No where on the bottle says its reef safe and another website says one of those ingredients aren't reef safe. The picture saying reef safe is no longer on Amazon so I'm guessing they fixed that bit of false advertising. Also I got burned in a spot or two while using this in a spot that was definitely sprayed. When applying it dries very fast so its kind of hard to tell where you applied and where you didn't. It also makes rubbing it in after difficult since it dries so fast.

I have used this product once 5 years ago and it was excellent. I wanted to but it again but was skeptical because of some of the negative reviews. I bought it anyways and i was not disappointed at all!  I have used it with two other friends and non of us got ANY sunburns. It smells good, and tastes good alsoüòÇ (got some in my mouth when spraying my face)  I would totally recommend it for everyone.

We have used this product before and find it to be our go to favorite. We love that it is reef friendly and take it on snorkeling trips in the Caribbean. It is very easy to use in the convenient spray and lasts a long time in the water. We also hike and find that it is resistant to heat and sweating. Just an all round great product.

eos-eos

I wear this when I run. It doesn't sweat off too badly from what I can see and I haven't burned yet. The scent is a little strong and you definitely don't want this in your eyes. Be careful when you apply this and you'll be happy with the results. The 2 pack was a good value.

eos-eos

My gosh, it feels like this is the 5th review for spray tanning lotion I've written recently. It's easy to use and smells great. I'm not convinced that it works as well as traditional lotion. You still need to rub it into your skin, so what's the point? These cans always seem to be half full so I'm not sure you get a great value for your money.

The Banana Boat Banana boat sport performance coolzone sunscreen spray is my favorite sunscreen. I keep it in the garage and use before I do yardwork. I live in Arizona, so I need great sun protection. Not only does the sunscreen work, but I love the way it sprays out cool (another advantage in AZ). It's easy to put on and not greasy at all. I've had problems with some sunscreens that drip into my eyes when I sweat (remember, this is AZ), but that's not the case with the coolzone spray. Two thumbs up!

We got some of this when we went to Mexico for my daughter‚Äôs wedding. It‚Äôs so hot there we spent a lot of time in the pool there. This spray on sunscreen is the only way to go.

eos-eos

I buy the spray on stuff cause I can't reach spots on my body by myself. Good protection, doesn't smell weird when being sprayed, so you don't have to run out of it like in a skunk cloud. Goes on even and keeps me from having a sunburn all summer long. Wish it came in a larger bottle/bottles. There you go.

Banana Boat Sport spray sunscreen is great for my active family. We swim and bike and do a lot of outdoor activities. Like any other sunscreen this should be reapplied often. The spray nozzle works great but should be wiped off to avoid sunscreen drying and clogging it up. The spray is easy to use and apply. Warning to not leave these in direct sunlight- the metal cans can get very hot. The sunscreen did not sweat off my skin after over an hour a cycling in the hot sun, and it also worked well when swimming. This is an spf 30 and each can is 6oz. It contained plenty of sunscreen for my family of 4 for several days of outdoor activities.

eos-eos

My family has used Banana boat products for years, but I've always loved the spray on type. When this 2 pack went on sale, I jumped at the chance, and am glad I did! Don't even think twice. Just watch for the sale and jump on it!

I mean is sunscreen lol. I burn easy and typically buy 50spf but went with 30 for this purchase. These are my favorite spray bottles, some don‚Äôt spray a mist but these do. Haven‚Äôt been burnt yet as long as I reapply as recommended. Not overly greasy feeling, but there is a little residue, because you sprayed sunscreen on your skin. I know people don‚Äôt wear it because of that but skin cancer yo! Stop feeling yourself up and you won‚Äôt feel it.

eos-eos

I bought this sunscreen on Amazon because checking prices it was the best price anywhere. Banana boat is a name brand with a good track record and I‚Äôve purchased it before and like the results. We use this when we went on a cruise, and I did not burn out of all. Didn‚Äôt even get a tan line. It works well if you need to protect from the sun.

eos-eos

We‚Äôre going to Hawaii next month, and selected this brand since ‚Äúreef-safe‚Äù sunscreen is required in Hawaii. I tried it out recently on my 2 granddaughters when they were visiting and going to the pool daily and found it very easy to spray on. I could also see that it provided a good water barrier.

eos-eos

Great product. Recently took a new job that requires constant sun exposure which disagrees with my pasty genetic background. Banana boat is a trusted name so decided to try out the 50 spf first. By following the instructions and applying every 2 hours I have not been sunburned all week and built up a very nice farmers tan. (not ideal but better than the lobster alternative) Would recommend and will purchase again

eos-eos

I have a condition that makes me sweat like crazy and normal cream sunscreens really exacerbate that. But this one doesn‚Äôt! And it works quite well. I burn VERY easily and have very pale skin, but I can be out in the hot sun for hours and not get burned using this sunscreen. It doesn‚Äôt feel very greasy and I don‚Äôt notice it at all after a minute of having it on. And the smell isn‚Äôt overwhelming which is nice.

eos-eos

I only use this spray for the areas I cannot reach such as my back. I use my lotion for the areas I can reach. I just wish it smelled better, it smells too chemical. I need to be careful to use it away from other people. I also wish it came in ‚Äúall natural‚Äù with a coconut scent.

eos-eos

These work great. Always get them when going to vacation as we always get gouged at resorts for things like this. Make sure you apply this outside as it gets everywhere and will make the floor slippery. Also don‚Äôt try to put sunglasses on and spray your face with it. 30spf works great if you are already somewhat tan but want protection from all day sun.

Well used to always need a travel sized one now a days with covid

Gotta get more of these for the summertime. I even use it at work, since I work outside in what can be baking hot summer days. The last thing you want is a sunburn, but the second last thing you want is the messiness of applying sun tan lotion. It cost more in this aerosol form, no question. But it makes up for it in spades between having no mess, and being able to apply it more evenly across your skin. Ive been using this for a couple 3 years now. And while my entire family are not converts yet, they are always envious when they see me arrive with it.

As someone who is very fair-skinned, I use sunscreen religiously and have tried many brands over the years. Banana Boat Sport sunscreen spray is the best I have used. It is lightweight, doesn't feel greasy or sticky, and provides all-day protection. I always trust it will protect me from sunburn even on the sunniest days, and it has never failed.

eos-eos

Great value! I love this spray. I always use the spray as a 2nd coat over the lotion on my kids. I figure a 2nd barrier doesn‚Äôt hurt. We just bought a house with a pool so we‚Äôll be using LOTS of sunscreen. I‚Äôm stocking up!

I own a bmw 3 series with a beige leather interrior. Well, I set a pen on the passenger seat while cleaning and didn't know it was leaking. You can imagine what happend next. I went on youtube and found out this was the miracle cure. Thanks banana boat for saving my seat !!

I really like this product for the golf course. I live in Texas so we get super hot sun and need to protect ourselves. I use this product because it is very light and non-oily while giving excellent coverage.

As with all water-resistant sunscreens, I reapply once I‚Äôve dried off a bit. It‚Äôs water-RESISTANT, not water-PROOF. And of course, it smells great!

These spray bottles almost make it too easy to put on sunscreen - I find myself putting on more than necessary (probably) to make I'm getting full coverage, but it's so easy to apply with these spray bottles... why not! A couple extra cents of sunscreen to avoid a sunburn - totally worth it.

I had to change to this after my allergy testing came back, and I spent five hours fishing in the mountains, no burn at all.

I lived in South FL most of my life and, after moving to OH where the sun seems to forget about us most days, I found myself so white I glow in the dark glow

So much easier to apply the sunscreen because it's in a spray can. I find it worked well for me I have very fair skin and after being outside in it all day long I still didn't get sunburned! LOL actually I was a little disappointed I didn't get 10 either!

It gets absorbed by the skin quite fast, not leaving an oily feeling. I find it much better to use while exercicing than any other brand. And the price for two bottles here is only 1 more dollar than a single bottle in Walgreens

Lightweight and not too oily. I replenish it every couple hours. I have to wear sunscreen often and banana boat is my go to for something that doesnt feel too greasy and is quick and easy to apply.

I really like that this is not a lotion or cream but a clear liquid. Non greasy but protects from UV very well.

I can spray this onto my back and avoid burning what I can't reach. It also works well for everywhere else. I am very fair skinned, so this product is a boon.

Great product if one knows how to use properly. This is great for being out and about, but it is NOT waterproof. I discovered that painful truth while beaching / swimming in the ocean all day. I applied it every hour, and still received a horrible burn. For swimming / salt water, I'll use cream-based waterproof sunblock. This is my go-to for festivals, farmer's markets, motorcycle rides, etc.

I‚Äôm a professional outdoor Lifeguard. I use this product (spf 50) daily. It‚Äôs a great value. Admittedly Sun Bum is a better product if you‚Äôre looking at all of the qualities rated but it is up to 3X the price. The generics available offer similar protection for less money but are sometimes inconsistent. It‚Äôs an all around solid product that I rely on daily.

There‚Äôs not too much to say about sunscreen. I love the cooling effect that this has. It‚Äôs really refreshing on a hot day at the beach or pool.
