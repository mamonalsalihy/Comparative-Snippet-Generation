Love this product. Doesn’t have the strong scent that a lot of sunscreens have. Not oily or heavy on the skin.

Very good daily one step protection & color. A bit thick, I mix with Argon oil (could use any other) for easier spreading application.

This product looks OK on skin -- but be very careful about wiping it off on any fabric that you don't want stained permanently! On a few occasions - I washed off on a washcloth & some towels. The tint rubbed off onto them. I wasn't concerned because I felt the tint would just wash off like any other cosmetic I have used. WRONG!! I washed with regular soap, then soaked, bleached, then with Oxi -- nothing removed all the tint. The fabrics are totally ruined. I called Josie Maran customer service & they were of no help except to say "well maybe you could get your towels dry cleaned". I brought to the cleaner & they said the stains were permanent & that I am not the first person who had this same problem with the Josie Maran tinted product.

Great sunblock and moisturizer. I have had skin cancer on my face so is important for a sunblock with a high rating. Love this one for my face I use it every day and also bought the tinted one which is great. I also have very sensitive skin and it does not leave any breakouts.

I love argan oil and use it straight in another brand. This product give me the argan, plus sunscreen and a hint of color. I don't like to wear foundation, so this gives me a healthy glow without the foundation, and saves time. I use it right over my regular moisturizer for extra moisture! It's not greasy and lasts all day. Bought a second bottle already.

It evened out my skin tone and is erasing the wrinkles for an incredibly smooth complexion. Especially at the age of 77!

Did not care for this product. Was looking for the original one that was tinted. It was more oil based. This is make-up. Yuk

When I first purchased this, I thought the tint was a little much however as time progressed and I continued to use it, I ended up replacing this as my daily “foundation” Since it was light weight and replaced it in lieu of my heavier foundation.  I do suggest after you apply it that you wash your hands so you do not get it on your clothing.
