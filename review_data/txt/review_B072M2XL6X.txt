First off, I would like to say that this product is the truth! It is a must have. I don’t write reviews regularly at all but this is worthy enough to write a review. This facial sunscreen/moisturizer will last you up to 4 months (at least for me it did). All it takes is a few (2) pumps before you start the day. This protects you all day long from hazardous sun rays, toxins, etc... And it doesn’t break you out either. Also, it works well on ethnic skin the tinted version. I am African American and it blends well into my skin without leaving a chalky appearance. Well worth the money! SkinMedica Essential Defense Mineral Sheid 35 SPF is bible!

This is a great product, goes on smoothly and adds a light coverup with the tint. It's comparable to the tinted SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense, but the SkinMedica has less of a chalky look and is also less greasy - which I prefer. Highly recommend!

This is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin type. It has a nice matte finish without grease. Although the SPF factor is lower for this product, the matte finish along with the neutral tint encourages frequent application without looking ghostly white and without clogging pores. I'd highly recommend this product after using several other name brand sunscreens. The subscribe and save program works great. The sunscreen I receive is in brand new condition with proper expiration date imprinted on the box. This is very important to me as sunscreen does expire.

Having been a lifeguard and being of the age where sunscreen was not the preferred method in the 70's... I find myself needing to protect this old face now. I find this sunscreen smooth, and easy to use. A little goes a long way. Great coverage! The tint is perfect for my skin tone.

Have used SkinMedica tinted mineral sunblock well over six years. Excellent product. Does not clog pores or cause breakouts. I apply it every morning (live in south Florida). Additionally, I prefer SkinMedica mineral tinted sunblock over Elta MD tinted sunscreen (it did clog my pores and the tint is lighter in color than the SkinMedica.

Love this sunscreen. It’s a must for those with sensitive skin. I breakout or react to most sunscreens on the market but with this I have no problem. I have the original one without the tint and it was leaving a slight white cast on my brown skin. I decided to purchase this product and as you can see on my picture it blended out so nicely. There was no white cast or pilling. I recommended this to anyone that is scared to try sunscreens.

I was just in Puerto Rico for a week and used this daily before I left the condo to be out in the sun. My skin is light and freckled and I didn’t burn at all! I love this product. Best one I have found. It goes on light and provides slight coverage. Not greasy at all on my face. I use it with the Aha/Bha products and my face is so smooth!

My go to face sunblock for everyday use. Recommended it to my MIL as well. Good coverage and I like the tint but it does need to be reapplied if you're out in the hot sun all day.

eos-eos

Excellent feel. Not sticky or greasy and doesn't leave a white cast. Great sun protection and no scent.

eos-eos

Love this. It doesn’t give any coverage but it’s perfect for oily skin since it doesn’t leave my face shiny or greasy at all even after wearing it all day.

eos-eos

I love this product because it comes tinted and without tint. A little goes a long way so be sure to use a little because if you put too much then it will be overly greasy.

eos-eos

Goes on smooth, not sticky, not too greasy (just perfect texture) and blends perfectly

Although it’s not labeled as sweat resistant, it’s pretty darn good. I work outside in Florida and this tinted sunscreen stays put unless I’m totally dripping with perspiration.

The SkinMedica tinted mineral defense shield is a wonderful sunscreen. I haven't used foundation since finding this product. I first purchased it several years ago at a local med spa and have purchased several since on Amazon. It goes on very sheer and is perfect for my sensitive skin. I have also purchased it for my friend who would experience breakouts from her sunscreen. She loved it as well. The tinted formula evens out my skin tone and doesn't streak or look blotchy at the end of the day. I have tried out other tinted sun blocks since SkinMedica. The other sunblocks have caused breakouts and have looked streaky at the end of the day. I will just stay with the tried and true SkinMedica.

wonderful for the sun. Good for your skin and keeps the aging sun away

I've been using this for over a year. Agree with other reviews. Light and it works well with a foundation. Non irritating too.

Have used this product for several years. I never use foundation now. It is a wonderful product for a good price and the bottle lasts a long time.

Wonderful product.

This is the best sunblock I've used I love that its tinted.

This TINTED Sunscreen works + less obvious. *I use it as a 'topper' (over SPF 100) It works GREAT.  Why THIS product: I had botched laser treatment on nose 5 yrs ago. The tech was poorly trained.  The net result is ANY direct sunlight on face / nose 'lights me up' like Rudolph the red nose + painful.  I use a white SPF 100 on my nose / adjacent. ***Then i TOP with  SkinMedica, tinted SPF 32. It stays. It covers. The tint is perfect. It's worth the cost.

I have been extremely disappointed in this product well, as I used to use the previous version of it. Like many things that are "the new and improved version" - it is nowhere near as good as the original (or previous) version I used in the past. I know have freckles around my eyes and on the top of my cheeks and I have never had those before. Clearly the sun protection is not what it's cracked up to be. Sorry, but I have to say it I wouldn't recommend buying this product and I will never buy it again. It wasn't horrible, but it was a lot of money for a product that doesn't seem to do much.. yes It coats your skin, and yes it make it minimal sun protection, and it gives a little bit of color, but nowhere near as much as the previous version of the product.

I used to wear the SkinCeuticals sunscreen product but recently switched to this product since it has cleaner ingredients than SkinCeuticals. This product definitely provides more of a tint than SkinCeuticals (I have a pretty fair complexion), but it's not unnatural; I make sure to also apply it to my neck to mitigate any differences. The product feels light and great on my skin. No breakouts. It doesn't feel heavy even after I reapply during the day. I probably would prefer to use a product with higher SPF on beach days, but this product is great for everyday use.

Sufro de Acné por lo tanto fue casi imposible conseguir un bloqueador que no me irritara, brotara, o me enrojeciera la piel, pero el dermatólogo me formuló este y me encanto, llevo un año usándolo y es muy rendidor, aparte de que tiene un poco de color y te puede servir para tapar las imperfecciones el día que no quieras maquillarte… Excelente producto.

I LOVE this sunscreen! I first got it at my dermatologist’s office, and then when I ran out, I ordered more on Amazon. It’s great for sensitive skin and is fragrance free, so you won’t smell like sunscreen at the office. It is perfect for an everyday face sunscreen (which we all should be applying every day). I love that it is tinted, so it doesn’t leave a whitish layer or mess up your tan. Best sunscreen ever!

This is the same sunscreen I bought at my doctor's office to use on my face and neck. It's tinted and replaces the makeup that I've used for years. It goes on smoothly, looks natural and doesn't cake. I'm so pleased with it that I don't see a reason to go back to using makeup. I also have the untinted sunscreen to use on my shoulders, arms, and back of .my hands. Both sunscreens moisturize without being oily or greasy.

eos-eos

It’s a good sunscreen and I like the texture, also doesn’t irritate my skin, but I have fair-ish skin and it’s a bit too dark. So I can’t give 5 stars, however, I mix it with my other sunscreen that’s white and it’s perfect. Just be aware that the shade may not match.

eos-eos

Has been a good product for my sensitive skin. Wish it would provide better coverage -- coverage is very light.

eos-eos

Works well, minimal coverage, can make your face feel greasy but better than most. Too pricey for the quantity though and doesn’t last long if you want to use it anywhere but your face or hands.

eos-eos

I have always been a skincare nut job, i have always loved skinmedica and this is my holy grain, the fact its tinted makes it so much better, i use it like a tinted moisturizer and ive noticed so much of a difference. I have since purchased so much of skinmedica products and im obsessed.

I don't know why the directions say 'to remove, rinse off with water'. This is clearly water resistant even though it's not marketed as such. Once applied, it dried down nicely and had a nice semi-matte finish. It also calmed my rosacea pretty well. However, I had the hardest time trying to remove this sunscreen when it came time to wash my face at night. I even tried a cleansing balm, oil cleanser, you name it. It still did not remove it all. I am returning because the excessive washing and scrubbing is really not good for skin.

My dermatologist recommended me and I love it.

This sunblock is fantastic it has a tint that blends really well and it’s very lightweight it does not feel thick and still offer great protection.

I was looking for a non-greasy moisturizer with SPF 30 or higher in the $30 range and was really having a hard time. This is a great, non-greasy, non-smelly, non-chalky-looking moisturizer/sunscreen combo. I use it as my everyday moisturizer. The tint is a bonus—I was skeptical, but it’s very subtle—and the lotion is light and easy to blend. The bottle lasts me about four months and I’m about to buy my third one.

I liked the added tint!

I really like this product. I feel a little goes a long way. The is the 2nd time i purchased this product I have fair skin so it's important to me to protect my skin. I am a fan a fan of this brand.  Nicky

More product would be good. The little container doesn't get you through the summer, but it's a great product and there's just enough color to it.

eos-eos

Not a fan. It is chalky and didn't absorb in well and was very streaky. The lab series tinted for men was better for my skin.

I was surprised that this product was so nice. I have very sensitive dry skin & no problem also gives a little coverage & slight tint. I will purchase again.

Doesn’t break my skin out

Goes on so easily. Really like the feel and look of it on my skin. Can wear every day under makeup or alone.
