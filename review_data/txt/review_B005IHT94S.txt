I've used a lot of, like, BB creams and foundations and moisturizers with SPF 20 or 30, but they've never seemed to work as well as a plain sunscreen of the same SPF. I've gotten a couple burns using those sorts of products. In the past, when I've tried to use plain sunscreens on my face daily, they've stayed greasy to the touch, broken me out, and made my makeup slide off.  I'm only 30 but I have started to notice some signs of lasting sun damage on my face (eek). And as someone with Type II skin and a family history of basal and squamous cell carcinomas, I knew I needed to get serious about sun protection for my health as well as my vanity. Some research revealed that while SPF 30 may be sufficient if you reapply throughout the day and use the product alone, you need much higher SPFs to get the same benefit if you're only applying once a day or if you're using other products on your skin at the same time. I started looking for a reasonably priced, SPF 50+, single-purpose sunscreen that I'd actually be able to commit to using every day. The local drugstore doesn't seem to stock anything that checked the three boxes of being good for facial use, over SPF 50, and under $10 a tube. So I turned to Amazon and found this.  I use a nickel-sized dollop of this product for my face. Applying this amount at first leaves a bit of a white cast and greasy sheen, but after 10 or 15 minutes it soaks in and becomes a nice, stable base for makeup. I've only been using it for a few days, but so far no signs of break outs or clogged pores (knock on wood). Since I layer it over a moisturizer, I wanted a high enough SPF that I could be confident I was still getting a lot of sun protection even if if it gets a little diluted by the other product. The only downside is that it stings the eyes like crazy! Overall, I'm quite happy with it and would recommend it.

Highly disappointed My husband used another brand and he didn’t get burn like my daughter and I did. We applied every hour and a half for 8 hours and we burned like crazy. Did not help us my daughter and I have a bad sunburn on our faces and shoulders. Also it did not moisturize skin. Will not use again.

I purchased this product for my husband after doing research to find dermatologist recommended sunscreen for those with pre cancerous skin on the face. He is outside most of the time and has a hard time finding a sunscreen that will protect his skin, stay on his skin, not drip off with sweat, not irritate skin, and not leave a white film on the skin. This sunscreen is the answer for all those issues. It is lightweight, stays on with sweat, no need to reapply often, not irrigating to the skin, no white film left behind, and protects really well. Thank goodness, our sunscreen search is over!

Beware, contains Oxybenzone.

Just what I needed. Seriously, I have tried several different sunscreens for the face and a lot of those were oily and left a white cast on my face. For reference, I am perpetually tanned thanks to my islander skin haha! I tried korean brands but found them to be expensive for their size and the amount of product you get. I went on a limb and purchased this not expecting much, but, it has definitely delivered and more! I tested it in sunny Cabo San Lucas last month, and it stayed put on my face. Didn't drip down, didn't oil up, and really helped to keep sun exposure to a minimum (of course I wore a hat as well). There was one day I forgot to wear my hat, and only applied this (before setting off to Chileno Beach) and I did get a nice glow but didn't get any sunburn. So, I will definitely be repurchasing, and will continue to, unless I have any future adverse skin reactions. Till then, this is my ONLY suncreen.

Let me first start off by saying that if there was a shade of foundation called "seethrough" I would wear it. I am as pale and prone to sun damage as you can possibly imagine. I know that spf doesn't really matter past 35 but sometimes your girl likes to be a bit "extra". I was an avid user of the spray formula for a long time and used the deodorant stick too for a while. Nothing seems to beat the old fashioned goop in a bottle. When you first apply it it's very thick and has your typical sunscreen scent (which I've come to love). After rubbing it in it gives me that glowy vampire "I work on my basement tan" look that I desire. Also, not getting skin cancer and looking like a leather couch is a big plus in my book too.  Side note: Jlo's makeup artist just spilled that he uses this on her to give her an extra glow for all you saucy golden gods/goddesses out there!!!

If you are looking for something light to wear over your regular moisturizer this works very well. It looks white straight from the container but goes on sheer and makes your skin look more radiant. I wore this while out and about this weekend and didn't get burned from the searing sun. With temperatures in the 90s all weekend it was great to know I wasn't going to get sunburnt. So I used this on my face and arms and it didn't affect my skin at all. No breakouts or oily residue. Just comfortable clean complete coverage. I'm happy. I'll buy this again.  ~The Rebecca Review

The sunscreen is effective. On a day with a UV index of 11, I put it on in the morning and was outside all day swimming without reapplying and never even turned pink. This is great for my pale Irish skin. On the does-it-work scale, this is 5-stars. The down-sides? It isn't shine free. It's pretty greasy looking, but doesn't feel that way on your skin. Secondly, for use on your face, keep it far away from your eyes. It burns for about 30 minutes if it gets in your eye and it doesn't take much to feel that way. While this is a great sunscreen, you will need something else for your face.

Everyone, ladies especially, but I'm telling all people, sunscreen is key. This Neutrogena brand is one that I tried before in the store with a lower SPF. On Amazon, I found a higher SPF, so I thought why not. I put on sunscreen every single day after my moisturizer (the next thing everybody needs badly after moisturizer is sunscreen!). The higher SPF didn't really result in and drawbacks and I'd rather have more protection!  This sunscreen is wonderful and light. To provide this much protection (supposedly, right - it's what the package says so assuming it's completely true) and not feel thick, sticky, or chalky... it's really excellent. And even if you work in an office, in the winter, all day, I still use sunscreen due the the damaging effects to our skin from lights. I will continue to buy this and highly recommend it to everyone.  The process has worked well for my skin to put on moisturizer, high SPF sunscreen, foundation, powder, and all the rest of the makeups.

Goes on easily, absorbed quickly to a dry feeling. Protected my fair, bald head completely!😊

I am autistic and have sensory issues with sunscreen. I don't like how most sunscreen smells or feels on the skin, and I suck my finger so I don't like accidentally tasting it if it rubs off on my hand. I also have sensitive skin which burns easily and can be easily irritated by products. This sunscreen smells like absolutely nothing once it is on. In the bottle it smells like a very faint lotion or powder, but once it's on the skin it is undetectable. I cannot even taste it if I apply it directly to my hand and sniff or lick it. It also does not feel like anything. If applied in large amounts it feels a bit moisturizing but that's all. I have also never had it get on my clothes, bed, furniture from wearing it. Buy this!!!!

eos-eos

I really like this sunscreen. It doesn't feel heavy on the face and didn't cause me to breakout, I have acne prone skin. It also did not cause irritation on my children's sensitive skin and didn't look ghostly on their skin or mine , we are of a tan - deeper complexion. I'd repurchase and recommend this.

eos-eos

This sunscreen is great for wearing alone or under make - up. It is ultra sheer, like it says, so it makes layering easy. If you are going bare-faced, it wears well because it is light-weight, and it absorbs well and is non-greasy. It spreads easily , too. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming at all. From what I can tell, it seems to be protecting from the sun, especially if I apply it 15 minutes before outside exposure and if I remember to re-apply. What I like best is that it really is sheer and it delivers a fresh clean, non-greasy feel like I'm not wearing sunscreen on my face.

So I used to work in the office of a cosmetic Dermatologist in Beverly hills and this is what he recommends to patients. I love the SPF 100 I want to post protection possible. I want to age gracefully and you can't do that if your sun beaten. I apply somewhat liberally and it looks very white at first but as it dries it softens. But do expect to have a lighter skin tone when using this, my mom hates how white it makes her so I buy her the SPF 50 which she loves. As this product dries you don't look oily which I love. When it's completely dried your skin has a matte finish. Incant smell it at all when I'm wearing it. My live in boyfriend who is also an Anesthesiologist wears this every day to work to protect his skin, he laughs and calls it his makeup jokingly bc it not only protects his skin but also improves the look of his face. Would highly recommend. We've been using this for over years.

I bought this to use as a more all over body everyday sunscreen to prevent sun damage and tans on exposed areas i.e. legs, hands etc. and it's well worth it, especially for the price. It comes out as a light cream texture and spreads easily when rubbing it into the skin with minimal white cast. It dries down fairly quickly, but I would say it takes a good couple of minutes for full dry down. It's not sticky or greasy afterwards and in my experience does not transfer or stain any clothing. As for as sun protection, I have not seen my skin worsen in terms of tanning at all which means it should be doing its job. Only con I would say is that there is the typical sunscreen smell that never quite goes away even after having sunscreen on all day (w/ no reapplication). But overall it's a good sunscreen and recommend if you're looking for a light body sunscreen for everyday use.  If you're wondering about using it on the face, personally I would say to use it when you're under a lot more sunlight (like beach, hiking, tropical sunny areas) because in my opinion there are much better suncreens for the face if you're more an indoor person or have little exposure. This one is more heavy duty than more cosmetically elegant sunscreens like biore uv watery essence or etude house airy sunprise and is less likely to be comfortable on your face if you're mainly going to be indoors. It's not bad for the face in my experience, but there's better if that's your intended purpose.

No matter what sunscreen I use, or how frequently I put it on, I would always end up with lobster red skin after a day in the sun. That is, until I found this sunscreen. It has seriously changed my life (no exaggeration). I no longer have layers of my skin peeling off when I try to enjoy living in Florida. I no longer have to live in fear of developing extreme skin cancer. Not only that, but it keeps me from getting tan! I personally adore how my complexion looks on me, and I like keeping my Irish skin as pale as the moon. I don't get burned or tan even if I'm at the beach all day!  Edit: This review is for the 100 spf.

This product lives up to its name and did a superb job of protecting me during a 3-4 hr afternoon of kayaking under the hot midday tropical sun.  About a year ago today, I kayaked the same route, under the same conditions. I used a well known SPF 50 brand from a friend, but got burned pretty bad.  This time around I upped the ante with Neutrogena’s SPF 100. I was diligent about re-applying every 25-60 minutes this time because I was constantly being splashed with water and with the hot sun beating right down on me, I felt I certainly was starting to burn. Better safe than sorry.  I did not burn one bit.  I used it on my face and didn’t break out which is also a plus. I also did not get any weird rashes which sometimes happens with other brands. All chemical sunscreens make me teary eyed, some worse than others. This one was on the milder side.  I wouldn’t use it as an every day sunscreen because it’s a bit pricy for the amount you get, it does feel a tad matte and sticky on the skin and it does have that typical “sunscreen” scent.  All in all, I love it. This is my new go-to sunscreen for max protection when I intend to spend the day directly under the hot sun. Highly recommend.

I am a ginger with very sensitive skin and this worked awesome. No breakouts and great sun protection. Did not have to reapply as often as I thought I would. Definitely recommend especially for those with pale and/or sensitive skin.

I've used this brand for years and it has earned its reputation.I'm surprised that I prefer it on my face over the thinner liquid that comes with the dry touch for face which also costs more. Even though my t-zone gets oily, this cream does not make my face greasy and causes no breakouts. It's thick so a little goes a long way and I feel like I'm getting better coverage. You get so much quantity for the price and the product is easy to find. I am careful with use around the eye area, though. Great price and free delivery on Amazon! Product arrived quickly and in excellent condition.

No white residue. Feels like heavy moisturizer going on & then just disappears! Great in water. Won’t make you look weird. NON-COMEDOGENIC!!!! Stop spending $$$$ on skincare. Neutrogena & Olay are all you need. Do you know why those 2 brands work but don’t cost a fortune? The high end brands use some new supposedly miraculous ingredient. Rich ladies spend astronomical amounts of cash on those products. If they truly work then Neutrogena & Olay use those ingredients. So you can pay a fortune to be a test bunny or just use products that are tried & true!

I figured SPF100 is a joke (anything over SPF50 really) but it does seem to make a bit of a difference for me. It goes on well on my sensitive skin areas with minimal initial sting and no ongoing discomfort. Can re-apply over initial coat with ease. Rinsing and re-applying also feels good.  UPF rating is also excellent. Put it on thick enough to make your skin look pale if you want good UPF from this or any other sunscreen.  Remember to re-apply after 2 hours when resting, and much sooner when working up a sweat, same as any sunscreen that isn't completely painting your pores shut.

I usually use Aveeno Face & Body 60SPF for daily wear with proper reapplication every few hours. I tried this product because it's broad spectrum and offers more protection. The advertising sheer non-stick formula was also a selling point I liked.  Took a long time to get to Canada. Longer than most things.  I have been using it daily with proper reapplications to ensure protection. It's not sticky or greasy, but I will use Aveeno 60SPF for face & Body under makeup. For daily wear it's important to be using a good cleanser or daily exfoliator to really cleanse the skin at the end of the day.  I like how this product keeps my skin feeling clean and fresh throughout the day, the texture is okay, and it offers great protection. I'll buy this product again. (hopefully it won't take so long to reach Canada next time)

Update Thanksgiving 2018. It's now been 4 months since first trying Ultra Sheer 100+. Frankly I am still stunned how well it works. We have now been back in Florida for a month and I walk or ride a bike daily. What I like best is it not only protects my non pigmented skin from burning in direct sun... it also keeps the rest of my hands and arms from tanning. This makes a huge difference. Wonderful product!  Original July 2018 A number of years ago I began experiencing vitiligo or loss of skin pigment on my hands. This meant I had to where gloves or use a high spf sunscreen. I have tried a number of sunscreens but they had some unusual problems from dissolving the adhesive on my Fitbit, to making my eyes water if I wiped the sweat off my forehead. Last weekend I gave Neutrogena 100+ a try. I was going to be outside in full sun for 5 hours. I applied it once, then again an hour later before I went outside and it worked perfectly! The next afternoon I tried just a single application before a two hour motorcycle ride. Again it worked exactly as I hoped., it was light, non-greasy, didn't transfer. When I got it on my shirt I just wiped it off. Could not be happier. Not saying this will change my life, but it sure will make it easier to go out in direct sunlight.

This is the best and most effective sunscreen I have ever used! I take medication that makes me very sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) and the last couple years I have just suffered after 30 minutes in the sun. I have tried everything then decided to try this after seeing all the great reviews. I put it on 30 minutes prior to going outside and I have literally spent hours in my pool almost every day with no problems! And I never have to reapply even after sweating and swimming. I highly recommend this product!

This review is for Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Water Resistant and Non-Greasy Sunscreen Lotion 100 SPF. I don't like a lot of sunscreens because they are too greasy. This is the second year I have used this specific Neutrogena lotion and I love it. It does not make me feel sticky or greasy. Worthwhile purchase and will continue to purchase this brand in the future.

My husband has had basal cell carcinoma 3 times! STILL, he refused to wear any sun protection because he never liked ANY products I previously tried to have him use. He always found everything thick & tacky. UNTIL our dermatologist recommended this Neutrogena sunscreen (it's the one he, himself wears!) Even in the year-round warm, humid weather of the tropics, and under the very harsh Caribbean sun this feels LIGHT & CLEAN. It dries immediately, and you even forget you have it on! If you know someone who is reluctant to wear sunscreen, PLEASE have them try this.👍👍

High SPF sunscreens are usually incredibly sticky and disgusting, or white and gloopy (think cliche lifeguard nose). This is a normal texture, that doesn't feel like you're glueing yourself. I got it to protect a surgical scar while it finishes healing, and so far, so good! Anyone with surgical or other scars should consider an SPF 100 or other protective measure to reduce the visibility of the scar. Sun can cause it to be more obvious when it's done healing. I'm not certain exactly how that works, I'm not a doctor, but my doctor suggested protection for 6-12 months.

I bought this because I experienced extreme burns and itching when using my UV/LED light to cure my polygel and gel nail polish... FIRST I want to emphasize that I applied it well to my hands and fingers before starting my manicure... THEN I carefully used alcohol to remove it from my nails, then proceeded with my mani... It totally blocked out the harmful rays and no burning or severe itching after... AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMOVE ANY OF THIS PRODUCT FROM NAILS ONLY BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH YOUR MANI...

I love this sunscreen. Protecting my face and ears and neck are very important as skin cancer runs in my family. I had gotten a trial size of this and loved it so much I bought a bigger 3 oz size. I love how little you need and the fact that make up goes over it flawlessly. It doesn't leave my face greasy looking if I choose to go makeup free! I even got my husband using it. It is airplane size friendly and lasts a long time.

I've used this for years and it always does exactly what it says, dry to the touch and sheer, it disappears on the skin. Also they've raised the SPF from 70 to 100, although these ratings have been described as arbitrary. Anyway, it has done a good job of keeping me from being sunburned in the harsh California sun, in which I am outdoors quite a bit of the day, all year. Quite gentle on the skin, but irritating if you should get some in your eyes, like any sunscreen.

I was looking to replace my roll-on stick from Neutrogena but the price has gone up so much. This cream works great. It is not greasy or runny. It has a good consistency for easy spreading and better coverage than the stick kind. I've used it a few times and have not had sunburn issues. It feels like nothing and doesn't bother my sensitive skin.

eos-eos

Most creams with sunscreen are difficult to get rubbed into the skin without leaving a white film. This cream is great, rubs in well and the coverage is great. I am in the sun for 2-3 hours everyday on the croquet court and I never get any sunburn. I am a face sweater, so you would think I would wipe it off, but no, it stays on. Best far sunscreen on the market and it's 100% coverage.

I like wearing this as an everyday sunscreen since it’s very light on the skin. It does say for sensitive skin however i broke out a little the first few days i used it but my skin even out after a week and i haven’t had any more problems with it. It could be because i was adding something new to my skin care routine or the product it’s self so just something to keep in mind.  Other than that, the product is really easy to spread and doesn’t leave a white cast on the face if applied correctly. I like adding it in layers to ensure full face coverage and avoid the white cast. It’s not sticky to the touch which is also a plus.  It doesn’t move or disturb any make up applied over which is awesome for those who want to wear this under their makeup.

This is my go to sunscreen, I burn easily but still love to be outdoors hiking, walking, or at the beach. With timely reapplication, this product allows me to do the things I enjoy without the painful sunburn.

Years ago I made the decision to do away with the "comb over" and began shaving the mostly bald area of my head. After some time of always having to wear a hat I stumbled across Neutrogena Sunscreen. It works wonders, keeps my head smoother and not sunburned. I use it every morning year round and cannot say enough good about the product. Additionally, I am a Amazon Prime member and always know I can rely on them to deliver my needs rapidly and professionally.

Works great, but I wouldn't call it "light." Feels a bit greasy when applying it, but does the job. My skin was badly sunburned the week before (didnt wear sunblock because im dumb sometimes), so I was pleased that another day in the sun didn't add to the damage. Overall good product.

Reapplying sunscreen makes my skin burn, but I am quite pale and have to reapply often. This sunscreen never hurts, protects well, and isn't greasy. It's my favorite.

I was pleasantly surprised that this product was not greasy or too heavy. It has a very silky finish. You can’t put too much of it at one time or it can “pill,” but it gives great protection. If I’ll be outside a lot, I’ll even put it on my face and haven’t had any problems with breakouts. I’ll definitely be purchasing this again.

I'm normally about the all-natural Zinc based sunscreen, but I wanted to try something chemical based. Luckily, I didn't have a weird reaction to it and the protection was nice enough. "UltraSheer" seems to be more of a marketing label than an actual category for Neutrogena. I have their Sheer Zinc Oxide Dry-Touch and this one doesn't feel that much lighter. At the end of the day, I'm happy with the protection. I still feel more comfortable with Zinc than chemical sunscreens, but when I want it to absorb cleanly, I would recommend Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer lineup.

I walk daily in Florida and I wear Neutragena 85 Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Water Resistant and Non-Greasy Sunscreen Lotion. I grew up here and always had a face full of freckles from the sun. As I age, freckles aren't so cute. This sunscreen has a high rating UHV value and protects my skin. It is sheer and not too oily feeling. I have roscea so my skin can be sensitive and breakout easy. This product never gives me a problem.

I have been using this sunscreen ever since I noticed I was getting these dark spots on my face. I tried many things to get rid of them, but they did not start to disappear until I started using this, which to me, it means this items is really good at protecting your skin from sun damage. Only thing in the bad column would be that they run out very fast, as I do apply as often as the label recomends. Also, at the beginning my skin feels dirsty, but given 20 minutes of drying, it actually feels very soft (though I don’t recomend touching you face at all). Last, I have used other sunscreens that smell like herbicides and stove cleaner, but this one actually smells like some king of soap.

I've been using Neutrogena sunblocks for years and have never been disappointed with them. I don't particularly crave for the sun like most people because I get easily tanned into an unpleasant unhealthy grayish complexion. I've been avoiding going out for long in the summer time but with the Ultra Sheer SPF 100, I can stay in the sun for as long as I need.  One time I went snorkeling in the Florida keys with some friends and after a day at the beach and in the water I could find only a hardly noticeable bikini mark on my back. My friend and her husband who used Banana Boat SPF 50 turned into two zebras while still on the beach, and on the next day their skin was peeling all over the body. If you're into getting tanned then this will not be a good choice for you.  It's also gentle to the skin, not heavy at all considering its high SPF, and not nearly oily as other brands at SPF 30. I wear it every day without any discomfort. I had a skin allergy one time with rashes all over my body, went to see my doctor, and asked if I could still use sunscreen. The doctor asked what sunscreen I was using and as soon as she heard Neutrogena she said "Yes, Neutrogena is fine." I've used other more expensive sunscreens sold in the department stores but none of them works as effectively as this product. Highly recommend to those who are concerned about getting tanned or sunburns, but you need to get a lower SPF if you just wanted to get tanned without peeling skin.

This is the best sun screen for my very fair, easy to burn skin. I can stay outside longer without worry of get sunburned. I like the dry touch formula. It doesn’t make my skin look all shiny or break out. This is good stuff! I hope this is helpful for you.

So I'm 8x at risk for skin cancer compared to the average person... therefor the dermatologist told me I could either go outside for 8 hours per week with no sun protection to limit the risk of cancer or apply this stuff multiple times daily so I can go out and about and be free as a bird.  It moisturizes well. people tell me I look ten years younger than I am and I think it's bc I have been putting this stuff on for years... can't guarantee it'll make you look younger but I wonder if that's the cause or if it's just genetic.

I work outside in the Texas heat and I thoroughly dislike sunscreen. This stuff really does go on like a quality beauty lotion and does a good job at Sun protection. It is dry not sticky at all and doesn't get into your eyes when you sweat. I apply light makeup over it and it's just like applying it normally. I'm going to add this stuff to my daily regimen...even in winter.

Purchased this for my little ones. They are fairer skinned and burn. Tied it for the first time when we had a bounce house with a water slide and pool. We were outside for at least 4 hours and they had no sign of redness after being in and out of the pool and in the sun the whole time. Used it again on a vacation trip to Disney and in the pool there with the same results. Multiple days in the sun with no sunburn. Goes on easy and feels drier to the touch than most sunscreens I have used. Started using it myself as I am out in the sun most days. Very good product.

Offers great sun protection but leaves a very noticeable white cast on the skin. This product is meant for very fair skin tones almost pale. So even if you don’t have deep brown skin or rich dark skin, if you have the slightest tint to your skin this product is not for you unless you are willing to deal with the white cast

I fell and the weed eater ate my face... you can imagine the damage... as I learned how to lessen the scaring that could happen with all the stitches and such... I picked this product... I knew the Neutrogena name and when it said 100 sunblocks I said that's the one for me... I put it on once the stitches came out and found that is was cooling on my face, no clogging, no stinging and somehow it made me feel better about the possible scaring... I mix it at night with other oils to keep the scars from tightening... and it helps... plus the no zit feature is a plus.

eos-eos

I don't go outside very often but I needed a sunscreen to use for when I do, which is usually on short runs. Didn't have to worry about sweating and the sunscreen stinging my eyes. Definitely an affordable investment for SPF protection on your face. Some reviews say it is hard to spread, but I never had an issue as long as I used enough of the product (and you shouldn't be too stingy with sunscreen anyways). I have combination skin. Haven't had breakout issues so far after 2 weeks of use.

I am someone that usually burns and rarely ever tans when out in the sun. I have never liked sun tan lotion though because I hate how greasy most of them are. I decided to give this one a try and was very impressed with it. It really isn’t greasy and does do a really good job with keeping me from getting all red when I know I will be spending time in the sun
