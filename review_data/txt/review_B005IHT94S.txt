I use it everyday and it works. Unfortunately, I have oily skin and I tend to break out around my nose area. So, I just changed my skin routine in the morning to make sure I donâ€™t break out

I love Neutrogena sunscreens, but not this one! After time passes, your skin will have a white, powdery residue, and it gets on absolutely everything! All over my car, my purse, everything. Will not buy again.

I have been using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer 100+ SPF Sunscreen for a while, but they discontinued it and changed all their sunscreen formulas to be oxybenzone-free. I thought I would settle for the 70 SPF version and I had the absolute WORST experience with it. First of all, it simply doesn't absorb properly into the skin. I waited a few hours and there were still patchy sunscreen spots on my skin! On my face I waited a few minutes and noticed it was drying in some areas and still greasy in others, so I made sure to blend it all in and it started pilling up!! It also leaves a very obvious white cast in pictures, which the original sunscreen never did. To top it all off, it broke my face out which never used to happen with the old formula.  There's no product on my hand for it to be separating and patchy like seen in the picture. I'm on the hunt for a new sunscreen now because this was shockingly disappointing.
