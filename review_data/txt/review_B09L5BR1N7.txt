My kids never have issues with this sunscreen while we have with others. Super clean and works.

I'd say if you havent tried Coola before, you are still better off buying full size. the only thing of value in this pack in the chapstick. I love coola, but i'm moving soon so thought it would make sense to just buy small versions..... NOT WORTH IT. the spray last two sprays on my chest and ran out. the face is a good size if you arent using it very often, but wouldnt last if you were using daily for 2 weeks. better off buying full size or checking tjmaxx/marshalls
