I have fair skin and am starting to get sun spots in my early 30s, so I decided it was time to invest in a better quality sunscreen with a higher SPF. After reading about how well La Roche-Posay performed as a sunscreen in Consumer Reports, I decided to try their products.  I prefer the cooling water lotion to the melt-in sunscreen milk, as I find it slightly less greasy. I recommend putting this on your face (don't forget ears and neck!) and letting it soak in for about 10 minutes before applying makeup for the best results. (In fact, I actually put a moisturizer on first, let it soak in, and then put this on, letting it soak in before applying makeup primer.)  The 5oz La Roche-Posay sunscreens are the best value, and are perfectly well suited to be used on the face, so no need to get the small versions of the "facial" sunscreens that cost more per ounce. They appear slightly greasy at first, but let them soak in and you will find that the greasiness subsides.

This is by far the best sunscreen I've ever used! It has great protect (never been burned wearing this), sinks into the skin nicely, and has good UVB along with UVA protection. Best of all, NO WHITE CAST!

This is one of my HOLY GRAIL products! Thanks to the YouTuber Thataylaa, because of her love of the product I decided to try it. I instantly loved it and now have used it for over 6 months.  Let me first say I have pale skin (like lightest shades of most foundations are still too dark for me) so I MUST wear SPF daily. I also have very sensitive skin I have to be very careful or I’ll break out with rashes. This product has not given me any issues at all. There is no fragrance and is paraben free.  I think this is actually meant for your body but I use it on my face every single day. In fact since using it I’ve had noticeably less redness and haven’t noticed any more freckles, nor have I gotten sunburned. It isn’t thick but not runny either, it lives up to the “water feel” it claims. It absorbs quickly and is perfect alone or as makeup prep. I can see a difference if I don’t use it under my foundation. I MUST say it is very dewy (which I love) but if you use it under your makeup and use setting powder it gives a very natural subtle glow. I have mostly dry skin but there are times I get a bit oily in my t-zone and it works great for my skin. Because of how dewy it is I wouldn’t think it would mesh well with super oily skin but they do have a matte version. (I think it’s something called Sunscreen Milk) I tried that one as well but I prefer the dewy for my skin type.  One of my concerns was the price but the amount of product you get is more than other face moisturizing sunscreens such as Neutrogena or Aveno. I was using those before and would use one a month and this lasts me 3 times longer and is much better consistency. So yes you pay more up front but worth it because of the quality and is a better deal in the long run.  Overall this is a fantastic product that I am subscribed to and will continue to repurchase.

I started using Anthelios sunscreen over ten years ago before it was approved by the FDA for sale in the US. It was the biggest selling, most highly researched, most effective sunscreen in the world, but because the licensing was owned by a European company the US Big-Pharma lobby was able to block it's sale here for years. So I used to order it from a Canadian pharmacy online. I lived in Palm Springs, CA at the time so I needed the best, most effective sunscreen available and because the temps there spend half the year in the triple-digits, I needed something that wouldn't just sweat off. Anthelios was the ticket! The only downside was that it cast a whitish tint to my skin - not a thick zinc-like effect, but a pale layering that gave my skin a pallor so I always had to wear foundation and makeup over it... even when I was going to the pool or golfing! It was inconvenient, but it was still extremely more effective than anything that was available here, and since skin cancer runs in my family I preferred dealing with the inconvenience and staying alive.  I was so pleased to find out that La Roche-Posay has finally figured out how to provide the protection of Anthelios without the white pallor! This sunscreen goes on clear and light - I can use it without piling makeup on over it. Yay! It seems just as effective as the older version, just more convenient. And you can buy it in the USA now! Life is good!  PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours. This item was provided for review consideration.  Cheers! Claire

As a dermatologist, I know Anthelios is the best broad spectrum sunscreen out there, but it is often hard to find. I order mine online. In the past, it has been a pretty opaque white product and hard to not look smeared with residue. This REALLY goes in well. I am fragrance sensitive so Fragrance Free is a plus ( and even if you aren't allergic to fragrance, who wants to go around smelling like a fruit salad?). Best on the market so far.

Simply put, you’re dry enough, you don’t need a sunscreen that is going to dry you out worst or clog your pores!  (For those not familiar, accutane is an extremely potent acne medication, also known as isotretinoin)  This has an awesomely high SPF 60, is cooling and refreshing going on, can look a little greasy at first but dries down in about 10 minutes. It goes well under makeup and it’s the best of the LP line-up that I’ve tried whole on accutane, and I’ve tried several since my derm gave me samples.  Before accutane I tried their SPF mineral (the 3-4 oz bottle that was more affordable than the anthelios brand) and while it worked, it felt like spreading diaper rash ointment on my face and left quit a white case if I didn’t slather makeup on over.  This bottle is 5oz and such a better deal than many other face specific sunscreens but I definitely use this on my face and neck primarily. You need this. I’m not being paid to say so.

It is the first sunscreen I've started using every day because it goes on so smoothly and doesn't leave a white cast. I've started paying more attention to sun protection and following Dr. Dray's advice that the best sunscreen is the one you use. This is it! I've used Neutrogena's Ultra-Sheer SPF 85 sunscreen before and while it worked very well to protect my skin during hikes, it was thick and hard to apply and would pill after a while.  For my combination oily skin, I think I tended to gravitate towards matte finish and dry touch sunscreens but I've found that they would sit on top of the skin and end up highlighting the dryer areas of my face. I like this La Roche-Posay one because it's slightly moisturizing and absorbs a little bit into the skin, making it easier to put makeup on afterwards. It's not the cheapest option but it's making it easy for me to apply sun protection every day. To me, the experience is worth it. At least it isn't as expensive as other brands like Colorscience.  Pros: - Higher SPF protection than what I usually find. 60 is pretty good since 30 is the minimum recommendation - Spreads very easily without too much rubbing. For other sunscreens, I would have to spend more time rubbing it into my skin to eliminate white streaks - No white cast - Leaves the skin dewy, not chalky. It seems a little bit moisturizing but it is by no means a substitute for moisturizer. I tried it on its own and it wasn't enough to keep my face hydrated all day.  Cons: - Not the cheapest sunscreen out there ($/oz)

About myself: I am ghostly pale, burn easily, in high elevation with lots of sun, active hiking and water sports, gate strong smells. This is important to note as: I have not burnt ONCE using this sunscreen, which is rare for me. I had been told to use it as the base layer and reapply with a different 30SPF when needed. Here is how I know it’s a winner: it’s been doing fantastic while swimming; it doesn’t smell weird, it applies really well (kinda runny but cooking and nice), doesn’t leave sticky film AND I took a long hike in high elevation with not being able to reach the part where my too crossed on my back and that was the ONLY part that burnt right at the short line after a full say in the sun with forgetting to Faldo t with me to reapply. Purchased us a second bottle already as it’s become the family favorite and is turning into the only one we use!!

eos-eos

I'm a male who really didn't want to have to put anything on my face but for medical reasons have to. My dermatologist recommended this and at first I was like you want me to pay this much money for sun screen that's crazy but then I used it and it's amazing and worth every penny. It is like liquid silk when applying.

eos-eos

This is the only sunscreen I can convince my husband to wear. It applies on easily without the very potent sunscreen smell. It still smells of sunscreen but no where near as gross as most sunscreens. I put this on my kids, one of who has severe eczema. This does not break out any of our skin. I’ve purchased so many bottles of this over the years!

I have fair skin that burns easily and is somewhat sensitive/reactive. I also battle skin cancer so finding the perfect sunscreen is critical! If you're like me, you need a product with a high SPF that stays put, won't leave a white cast and feels like there's nothing on the skin. I've tried many, many sunscreens that check some of those boxes but not all...until now. THIS IS THE ONE! Recently I spent all day at the beach wearing this and reapplying as directed - not a speck of a burn (or tan) anywhere! Skin feels and looks like skin, not a white mask or covered with a tacky layer. I am so impressed!

eos-eos

This is amazing! I love how light it is, how well it provides coverage from the sun, and how it melts into my skin! It does NOT irritate my sensitive skin at all and is a really great moisturizer. I usually break out from any moisturizer with sun screen, but not this one! This is the second tube I've gotten, so I've been using it for about 10 months. It's worth every cent!

eos-eos

I got this mainly because it's great for sensitive skin and I was going on accutane, but I never want to go back to regular sunscreen now. It has "Cooling Water" in it, so it feels good to put on, it's not sticky or thick, it's pretty watery/runny in consistency yet is effective. you can put it on your face and your body. You don't feel like you don't want to touch any part of your body after like regular sunscreen (you know when you stand like a scarecrow after trying not to touch any body part to any other body part bc you just feel so oily and gross). xoxo love you la roche posay

This product contains two ingredients we know to be killing the coral reefs. They're found in many sunscreens: Octinoxate, and Oxybenzone. This sunscreen contains the latter. Even if you don't care about the environment (and why not? you do live here!) you probably aren't a fan of hurricanes, tropical storms, and the resulting floods. Coral reefs protect our shoes from erosion, mitigating the damage these storms, storms increasing in frequency and intensity. Please skip this sunscreen, and others containing the ingredients Octinoxate or Oxybenzone.

I’ve been looking for a great sunscreen and makeup primer combo that leaves a dewy finish. Hoorah!! This is it. Love the smoothness and radiant healthy glow it leaves without making me look like a greasy mess. This allows for a smooth full makeup application that lasts for up to 14 hours and more without fading, pilling, or looking weird. It feels great upon application. Wonderful product!!

eos-eos

i now use a little bit of this on my face every single day. Sun or not. It goes on 'watery' and thin and i do not notice the typical sunscreen odor. I like how easily it spreads onto my face, not like regular sunscreen where you really gotta work it in. Kind of acts like a moisturizer too. Sometimes i will use this instead of a moisturizer! Otherwise, it does fine if you put moisturizer on after. I am prone to acne and dry skin. No increase in acne since using this daily. Dry skin has also improved. Can't beat sun protection! [Honestly though, buy the european version from ebay. Much better spf.].

eos-eos

This stuff, where do I begin? Expensive, yes. But you can't put a price on going down to the British Virgin Islands in the middle of winter, with extremely fair and sensitive skin, and not burning at all! I was impressed with this, it was everything all the reviewers said. If you want to make sure you don't burn on your trip, buy this stuff. You need to reapply often, but it really works and I highly recommend this product!!!

eos-eos

Lathering up with this sunscreen doesn't even feel like a chore, the water feel is what your skin wants, there no way else to say it. My skin was hydrated, protected, and loved for five hours of sun exposure. I applied once; swam, sun bathed, sweated and still, it remained. Not a hint of a burn.

eos-eos

Obsessed with this. I'm a long time Elta MD sunscreen user (still use the tinted 41 for face and love it). But LRP has got Elta beat in the body sunscreen category. This lotion is literally like water going on. Not greasy. No residue. Smells great. Ordering another tub now while it's 25% off. By the way I've tried all the expensive sunscreens and the cheap ones too. My skin is sensitive. This stuff is bomb!

eos-eos

Not oily or greasy, very lightweight. Im fair complected so I burn easily. This keeps my face protected. Most sunscreens cause an acne breakout, but not this one! Can easily wear under makeup. I wear this everyday

eos-eos

I’ve been using it for a long time, is really good for sun protection and sensitive skin. I’ve notice that my arms get very dry at the end of the day,I use a moisturizer under it. I work outside and on summer time I have to use a lot everyday, I definitely recommend this product it’s one of the best sunscreens in the market.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen! I use it every year because it’s not thick and greasy like other sunscreens. It’s also not full of bad things for your skin. I highly recommend.

I can sit on the beach all day and will not burn. I usually start out with 30 SPF then use 60 later. I get a light tan but no redness. It's pricey but avoids burns on vacation. Feels nice on the skin too. I do not like the sticky feel of other lotions. This is the best I've used.

eos-eos

this was recommend to me by my dermatologist after being diagnosed w/skin cancer. highly recommend this lotion. it is so lightweight and absorbs into the skin quickly. not thick and greasy like many others. provides great coverage.

eos-eos

Light and easy to apply. Leaves no trace of white smears and absorbs easily in minutes, with no sticky or slippery residue left behind. For years, I thought this sunscreen only came in a 30 SPF. I was thrilled to find it in a 60 SPF too.

I have been using LA ROCHE-POSAY for three years now, I have acne and my skin used to react to every single sunscreen I used before, I literally tried like a hundred sunscreens before this one, but when I started using La Roche-Posay, I notice that my skin didn't reacted , I think it is because of its water feel or its chemicals, Now every friend that I have with the same acne problem, I recommend this sunscreen and they love it! if you have acne o sensitive skin this is your best option

eos-eos

I like this product but I do not use it as sunscreen all over my body or outdoors for the pool. The only thing to note is not to put this anywhere near your eyes and do not put it on your face if you're going under water in a pool because it will run down your face and burn the crap out of your eyes. other than that, as a night time and before makeup primer lotion, i love it.

eos-eos

This is the ONLY sunscreen I’ve ever used that doesn’t make you sweat after application. This stuff goes on cleanly, doesn’t streak, and dries instantly. It really is cooling and feels weightless. Stays on but doesn’t make your skin feel sticky or greasy. Don’t know what they put in it but it’s pretty miraculous. I’m sold.

eos-eos

Chemical sunscreens usually leave an oily sheen, whereas physical sunscreens leave a white cast, so you’re left with trying to find a sunscreen that does one of those the least. This is a very lightweight chemical sunscreen. I find it leaves a little sheen but not enough to quit using it. I wear it under makeup, mix it with Cover Fox foundation drops, or put translucent powder over it if I’m not wearing makeup. That gets rid of the sheen. Love this stuff.  Do note that if you have super dry skin, you may need a supplemental moisturizer.

eos-eos

I love this stuff but wish they had the higher spf available. It is water based which was awesome. Rubs on like a moisturizer so it didn’t leave any patchy white spots on my face or body. I didn’t burn any. I did still tan. I also reapplied it every time I started to feel the heat on my skin. Basically like every hour or two because I was also in the water a lot. I did get some in my eyes but it was my fault. We traveled to Dominican Republic which I heard had a lot of humidity. They were right. Fortunately, it didn’t melt in my eyes. I had it on my eye lid and right under my eyes. After being outside for a couple of hours, I wasn’t thinking and I rubbed my eyes. That’s when I got a little bit in my eyes. It did tingle just a little but was short lived. Honestly, it felt like any other sunblock that I have accidentally gotten in my eyes but it didn’t tingle as long. I highly recommend it. Also just for clarification purposes, I am porcelain white. When I’m in the sun, I burn like a lobster then go back to white. I’m actually tan and I like it. Might not last long. We just got back from vacation.

eos-eos

My skin is oily and highly acne prone but this stuff is not breaking me out and goes on butter smooth, which is totally not like the neutrogena ones. The neutrogena ones break me out or leave white streaks but this one stays fluid and is easily blended in. I put a matte tea tree lotion over it and it keeps the look very soft and dewy but not oily. It sucks it’s so expensive but you get what you pay for!

eos-eos

This is my all time favorite spf. I use it on my face, neck, and arms daily. It absorbs quickly and does not leave my face feeling too greasy. It spreads really easily to give great coverage. I've already purchased a second tube for back up. One tube has lasted me about three months or more with daily use. I also like that there's not a strong scent and it does not make me break out.

eos-eos

I've bought so many different sun screens over the years, and Anthelios Cooling Water Lotion is by far the best. What I like best is how lightly it sits on the skin, absorbs well, and that it leaves very little, to no shine. Also, it doesn't bother my eyes and doesn't cause me to breakout. And my husband likes it too.

eos-eos

I am a medical esthetician and I love this sunscreen! I tell my patients all the time about this and to go buy it! IT FEELS AMAZING ON THE SKIN!!!!!!!!!! It does not leave a white zinc tint, and it is very hydrating and as it is says very water cooling feel. Awesome product!

eos-eos

I absolutely hate using sunblock because it’s greasy, thick, and takes too much effort to rub in but this is a game changer for me. It’s absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave me oily, and doesn’t cause breakouts. A bit pricey but very worth it.

Bought this sunscreen before I went on a vacation in an island in the Philippines. IT WAS THE PERFECT SUNSCREEN! Super lightweight. Can be used on the face and/or body. Doesn’t leave a white cast on my face or my body like other sunscreen. Very good under makeup and no scent at all which I like. It’s not sticky not oily. Even my fiancée swears by it. Definitely gonna buy again! You get what you paid for. Pricing is reasonable.

eos-eos

Typically, I skip sunscreen due to it's feel/smell on my face. In the past, everything has left a film that irritates me and I have to scrub it off. This doesn't feel like a sunscreen and doesn't smell. I can tolerate this with no issue. So glad I tried this. I am putting this on daily right after a shower. Very happy guy! Thank you!

eos-eos

I have no complaints other than the price, but considering this product I expect it to be more expensive than other competitors. It rubs into my skin smoothly and doesn't leave a greasy feel or look. I have hairy arms and my arms typically look like a wet dog when I use sunscreen on them, but that is not the case at all with this stuff. I use this as a daily sunscreen and have nothing negative to say so far after using it for a couple of months.

I love this stuff as my day cream! I have very dry pale skin and this stuff makes my skin look naturally radient and dewy. I heard about it on YouTube while watching one of my fave beauty bloggers. I will def be buying this again.

I'm really surprised by how nice this goes on. Not sticky, not greasy, no white cast. It's so light that it's a pleasure to put on. For the fall I have been putting it in my face and it's been fine. I would get this again for sure!

eos-eos

Great facial sunscreen! I have very dry skin & can almost get away with using this as my moisturizer & sunscreen. I love the dewy/glowy finish it leaves my skin. It's great on my sensitive skin. It definitely helps my skin along with providing excellent sun protection. I would definitely repurchase & highly recommend.

Best sunscreen ever. I'm allergic to everything! I have no skin reactions to this product. It goes on like water and disappears unlike the thick sheen from other products. It has a very light aroma that I find ok. I’m very sensitive to smells and am allergic to most ingredients that create smells. I wore this on a 97 degree day gardening. Sweated my butt off for 3 hours and no sunburn and I only put it on once.

Yes, it's pricey. Seriously pricey! But, if you want a sunscreen that works exceptionally well and feels like you're just rubbing water on your skin when applying it is worth every single $.

This sunscreen is the bomb. It immediately turns from white to clear and absorbs super-fast with no sunscreen smell. It goes on perfect under makeup. It has UVA and UVB protection, and I will wear this without fail from here on out because it is amazing.

Although I wish we in the US could have the EU approved ingredient Mexoryl in higher SPF (I have only found it here in SPF15), I love this sunscreen. It doesn't make my makeup pill, which is sooooo important. I use sunscreen year round because of malasma that never goes away, so non-pilling sunscreens are a must. Wonderful texture.

This sunscreen is excellent. It does not leave a white cast on my tan skin (at all) and absorbs quickly and cleanly. It also worked beautifully under makeup. Winner!

Great for sensitive skin and people with allergies. Doesn’t irritate my eyes as all others do (when I apply to face — not eyes). Lol

I've tried more than 20 different brands of sunscreen and this is the best so far. It goes on smooth and feels really moisturizing with zero stickiness, zero greasiness and zero white cast. Wonderful product! I love it.
