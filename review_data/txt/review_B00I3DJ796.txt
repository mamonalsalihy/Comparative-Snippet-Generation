This has been our favorite sunscreen for a few years. Smells great, is easy to apply, and perfect size for backpacks, beach bags etc.

I wanted to buy an alternative to chemical sunblocks so I bought this "pure lavendar" "reef friendly" "Botanica" and it is none of those things. It is the same nasty chemicals (Avobenzone Octycrylene Octo Slicylate), To protect their reefs Hawaii has banned products such as this one. This is not a botanical product. And it is not pure anything, it's the same nasty chemicals. The packaging is outright lying. Don't buy this lying brand.

Been using it for years.

I couldn’t stand the smell as soon as it came out of the bottle smelled like chlorine

I’ve used Alba product for years and have never had a problem but the fragrance free sport sunscreen was extremely sticky and hard to blend in. It also turns you white the second you hit water, no matter how long it has been since application. I don’t want to look like I didn’t rub in my sunscreen. Amazon refunded my money so for that I am truly grateful! Two stars because the protection seemed good.

I love this cruelty free sunscreen! It smells good and does the job! I wouldn’t say for sensitive skin because if I put it on right after shaving my legs I get irritation.

My family went on a beach vacation and spent a lot of time prepping. We have 2 teenagers and wanted great all day sun block. This is it! It’s easy to spread. Actually absorbs without leaving your skin white and we didn’t burn. On our last day of vacation we ran out and bought another brand and we got VERY burned. I now am sticking up on this great product.
