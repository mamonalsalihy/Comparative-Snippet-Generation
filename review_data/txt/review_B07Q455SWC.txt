We just love this product- our third tube of this so far! Works great without all those chemicals which is what attracted my attention as my husband is a cancer survivor and Coola was on the list for those folks. Goes on well and lasts, which makes it a good value for what you are receiving. Doesn’t dry the skin out but keeps it supple and moist.

This product protects my skin against the sun and moisturizes too. I love the feel on my skin. It's nice and light and doesn't clog my pores.

I love this sunscreen as it doesn’t make me breakout. It is hard for me to wear sunscreen in the past because they all were very thick and made me break out. Now I use sunscreen all the time. I even use it on my face. Haven’t had a breakout using it.

love this suntan lotion. Makes skin so soft, no sticky feeling. Has a light scent

This is literally the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. I have problem skin and this sunscreen does not cause me any issues. In fact, it alleviates my skin issues and hydrates so well. It goes on like moisturizer, leaves no white residue, it does not sweat off. I applied once and laid in the Mexican sun all day and did not burn. 100/100 would recommend. Also smells amazing - I was worried about the scent and my sensitive skin, but no issues.

I love this sim block. It doesn’t have that gross feeling from other other sun blocks. It feels great on the skin. I wear it daily. I even use it on my face from time to time. I do prefer the matte and tinted face one from coola for my face.

I love this sunscreen - doesn't leave you feeling greasy and oily. Scent is pleasant and subtle. Wish it were not so pricey, but you get what you pay for.

It smells like coconuts, rubs in well (doesn’t leave white marks on your skin), and is very moisturizing. It’s a little pricey, but worth it.

I can always count on COOLA for great protection from the sun's harmful rays. Great coverage - by lotion or by spray. And I love their new facial sunscreen too - with a tint!

This sunscreen is expensive but it honestly is one of the best ones out worth the money

I love the smell, not greasy at all. I am a Coola sunscreen user for years! Love it.

Fresh scent, not too greasy and absorbs nicely

Natural without leaving the white residue that other organic sunscreens leave.

Love this sunscreen! It smells great, and isn’t super sticky.

Top of the line. Works well, ultra moisturizing, luxury product. I am a big fan!

Even though this is considered "natural" sunscreen (more natural?), it works really well.

Loved the clean ingredients plus the scent. I was in the Caribbean for two weeks and never burned. I’m using it as a moisturizer now that I’m back home.

The only sunscreen that doesn’t make me break out.

The product is top notch with the exception of the smell. It not terrible but not as I hoped but the sun protection and moisturizing is great. I ordered the spray that has the pina coloda smell but haven’t received it yet. I heard that has the best smell.

Smells great, feels non-greasy, reapplied multiple times after being outside and getting in the water and still suffered some painful burns after spending a full day in the sun on the beach. Will not be purchasing again. For reference I am pale and blue-eyed but my boyfriend typically does not burn due to some Italian heritage and he also burned pretty badly when using this sunscreen. Will be sticking with the greasy sunscreen brands that actually work in the future!

Omg, please learn from my mistake and DO NOT BUY. My bf and I went on a trip to Puerto Rico and I bought 2 eco/ocean friendly products. This coola sunscreen and a spray beach bum sunscreen. First day at the beach we used the beach bum and it worked fine. Second day we went to a neighboring island and applied this coola sunscreen 3-4 times in 4 hours. Let’s just say both of us are soooo burnt and red like lobsters- I might as well not have used anything. Both of us used a separate face sunscreen and our faces are fine.

Used this sunscreen on our vacation and got burned out as a family. We used to apply the sunscreen every 80 min but again we got burned. Look at the pictures. Shame for the company that sell this pricy product to ruin people’s life.

eos-eos

I burned so badly with this, and I know it was the product because I used another brand on my face and didn’t burn my face! I can’t believe this is a real product, I am bright red. So mad

This Coola sunscreen smells awful - very chemical odor. So hard to wash off, the smell lingers..... Quite abnormal for this brand. I loved all their other products but this expensive mistake is going straight into the trash

eos-eos

Very nice. Does not smell like other fake coconut scents. I got unscented. Smells like a natural mineral product. Not sticky. Absorbs fast. You will need to reapply often esp if in the water. But it’s a great product. I’d say if it’s very stinky like previous comment you’ll want to make sure you didn’t get a fake product.

eos-eos

Not thrilled. We got burned after being at the beach for 2 hrs. My girls went in the water so maybe it isn’t waterproof. I am not sure. I like the lightness of it but you pay for that .. it’s not enough coverage. I won’t buy this again. Way overpriced when it doesn’t do what it is meant for.

My go to favorite face protection!! LOVE that it’s 50 and really love the scent!

Best sunscreen period! This is also great for use in eco sensitive areas and oceans . Smells great & I even use on my face if I’m out of my spf for face . Highly recommended to anyone cares about long term use and sun exposure. Since I am A runner in AZ it’s way important! But first found in Hawaii & never looked back worth every penny
