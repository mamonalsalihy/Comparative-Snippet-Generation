After reading reviews and consulting the environmental working group guide, I choose three different sunscreens to take on a recent 7 day Caribbean cruise and the Blue Lizard Sport Mineral-based sunscreen (no oxybenzone, no octinoxate) SPF 30+ UVA/UVB protection (8.75 oz) was the clear winner. All three shipped and arrived in good shape well within their expiration dates. The Blue Lizard sunscreen is white, thick and creamy, but not too difficult to spread on your skin. There was no odor and it protected my skin from sunburn when snorkeling - no small feat as I have fair skin and no sun exposure on the back of my legs coming from a northern climate in winter. It does have a noticeable white cast when you first apply, but I found that helpful so as not to miss any spots. the white does diminish after it has been on a few minutes. It did not rub or peel off. The change in the bottle color with sun exposure was a great reminder to reapply. I also tried Beyond Coastal Active SPF 34 sunscreen and La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Sunscreen Milk Body & Face Sunscreen Lotion Broad spectrum SPF 60, Oxbenzone free, oil free, water resistant. The Beyond Coastal was just OK - it was very thick and difficult to apply, so I would not buy again. I had used their old formula for another trip in the past and liked it but their new formula is not as good. The La Roche-Posay, by far the most EXPENSIVE, was the WORST of the bunch. I has a distinct chemical odor. I applied it 30 minutes before changing into my swim suit and and cover-up, it started to peel off before I even left my room. I had to reapply a different sunscreen all over again. I will buy the Blue Lizard again.

After a few brutal treatments at the dermatologist, I have become quite the consumer of various sunscreen products. This stuff works. While this product goes on a little thick, it will rub in (can't be said for all zinc based sunscreens). I was using a much more expensive brand and I find this to be just as good - if not a little better in terms of sun protection.  Highly recommended.

This stuff REALLY IS waterproof!! It goes on thick like pancake batter, a little goes a long way! But once it's rubbed in well, it disappears and then STAYS PUT in the water. I was at the lake for 8 hours, and this stuff didn't budge. You can see the seal on your skin as the water just beads up and rolls off. It's pricey, but WELL WORTH it not to get a terrible sunburn when you forget to reapply....which we all forget when we're distracted having fun. The FDA only allows sunscreen companies to claim "80 mins water resistant"....but this stuff lasts all day.

As a pasty, pale person I have tried almost all of the sunscreens on the market. This brand is one of the few that keeps me from burning. I’m addition, this was one of the few brands that was allowed At a resort we stayed at. We could only wear sunscreens that were safe for the coral reef.

The best sunscreen! I am very prone to sun poisoning and usually break out in hives or have an allergic reaction at first exposure but this is the only sunscreen that prevents that! So glad I found it; worth the price

I’ve been fighting and so far beating melanoma this year (thanks 2020). I have a 6” wound across my back, 2” gash on my left cheek, a 3” wound on my left neck where they tested lymph nodes for spread. What I’m saying is, buy excellent sunblock and use it. According to the melanoma community, this is the best. Goes on nice, seems to be sweat resistant (I’m a boater and cyclist). It doesn’t stink. It feels substantial. I haven’t gotten sunburned this year because I avoid the sun as much as possible, but also because I use this stuff. Stay safe out there y’all.

The sun protection is amazing. Week in hawaii without getting burned. Little thicker then sunblock I'm used too so there was some trial and error on applying. O ly downside was when I went to reapply after being in the water, didn't spread as well or rub in on wet legs. The bottle changing color depending on uv rays was super helpful. Bit of overcast and a breeze can be deceiving.

I have been buying this brand for 12 years, since having to research sun blocks for a child with skin problems and coming across stellar dermatological reviews for this. It's fantastic. I know they wouldn't endorse this, but I can put it on myself and the kids in the morning and it lasts all day, even through sweat and the pool. Yes, it's thick and leaves you a little whiter than before, and yes, it can stain of you immediately touch fabric after applying, but if you just give it 5 min to dry, it's no longer greasy, doesn't rub off, looks less white, and will totally protect you. Plus, it's better for the environment.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen and will never use anything else!! It hurts that it costs so much more than other brands but that’s because it works SO MUCH BETTER! I started using this brand last summer and my kids NEVER got burnt. The best brand I’ve ever tried. Would recommend to everyone (plus my dermatologist recommended it to me). Follow Daily Dish and Deals on FB for more tips and Amazon sales!

be warned that at first the sunscreen shows up white on your skin.. but in a few minutes that disappears, and then it works very well, and, better, does not hurt the coral reefs (at least that's what they say). I will say this bottle seems to be lasting and lasting .. one bottle goes a long way

Excellent sunscreen! Protects my skin very well. Even while vacationing in Hawaii. You need to rub it in a bit more than other sunscreens, but it truly works. And it is Reef Safe which is so important for protecting our sea life and coral.

Recommend this sunscreen for people that burn easily. I am fair skinned and freckle and can't be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, however Blue Lizard allows me to be out for longer periods of time and not worry about getting sunburned - even in the water. It is the best I've found for my complexion and even young children. It has been a great product for me.

This sunscreen is bulletproof. Put it on in the AM, sweat all day biking up to 14,000ft. No sunburn! I burn easy, too. This was recommended by my dermatologist. I'll never go back to other sunscreens! It's not greasy and doesn't leave a weird film on your skin like many sunscreens do. Buy it!

I am an avid golfer in a sunny hot climate and have used this sunscreen for the last 5 years. It protects my skin better than any other sunscreen. Because it is mineral based I feel much better In using it over the chemical products that dominate the store shelves. The zinc does leave a white tint to my skin but I am more concerned about my skin protection than I am about being a fashion icon.

This sunscreen is thick and definitely leaves its trace...but it is the best. I think it gives me better protection than any other sunscreen. It stays on well and is chemical free.

I used Blue Lizard on a trip to Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. We visited the Great Barrier Reef in a bright, sunny day in the tropical sun of Carins,AU. I have red hair and did not burn. Also used it in Hobart, AU which has a ozone hole in summer. The bottle would immediately turn blue in the sun but I did not burn. Love this stuff and it is reef safe. It disappears when you put it on as well.

I have very fair skin and a disposition that prefers to be outside. This stuff keeps me from getting burned, and wears well in the water. Worth the little extra $$$ if you care about not getting melanoma and not killing the corals.

My daughter is a wildlife biologist and she spends many hours in the summer sun. She likes the fact that this is mineral based sunscreen. It covers well without making her face look white and has excellent protection.

eos-eos

My favorite sunscreen for the kids. I know they’re protected from the sun and safe from any unwanted harmful chemicals. It doesn’t sting when applied like other sunscreens. We use the sport because the kids like to swim.

My dermatologist recommended this due to my recent skin biopsy and surgery. Use both the body and face sunscreen daily. A little greasy and thick to spread but works great to protect from burning at the pool.

eos-eos

Very thick sunscreen but not so terrible that you can’t rub it in completely. I was worried that with it only being an SPF 30 that I would burn in the Caribbean with my pasty white winter skin. Reapplied every 2 hours and no burn all week!

We went to St.Lucia which is in the W. Indies. It’s close to the Equator and the sun is direct. This sunscreen work well. I did get tan and we saw a lot of people that were very sun burn. We spent time at the pool bar and had to re apply every 3 hours.

It’s great for water use. Loved using it. It rubs on think, but it does a great job. The bottle is a nice touch.

No long review required.. beat sun block we've found. Used for several years, still very happy. Excellent product

this is seriously the BEST sunscreen. i wore this yesterday and it lasted for a whole soccer game (90 minutes) and it stayed on for through train and sweat! i love this sunscreen, and it’s even reef safe! it’s a little to oily for me to use everyday but i wear the blue lizard mineral face sunscreen

This is the best protection for you skin, i lather the kids in and then let them play. Offers excellent sun protection

Nice helpful, handy, comes in a variety of sizes. We have been using it for years.

Goes on nicely and disappears. Easy to use. Seems to prevent UV skin damage.

We never burn using these, stays on longer than it says. Watch out for staining items though, I don't like to get it on the car paint or leather.

This my favorite mineral sunscreen ever! Spreads super easily and doesn't leave me with ghost face. Remember to reapply as recommended.

This sunscreen was recommended from my dermatologist and I have to say, it’s great! Covers well, great protection, and I love the color changing bottle to remind you to re-apply!

Great sunscreen! I have atopic allergic dermatitis and I can safely use this lotion on my body. Recommended by Mayo Clinic dermatologist.

We have used this product for a few years and were happy to find a product that was as "clean" as possible. Not a fan of chemicals. Of the zinc-based sun protection products, Blue Lizard spreads pretty well. Leaves a subtle white sheen, although sun protection is the priority.

Love this for face application

Work very well on my daughter with eczema she will only use blue lizard.

White film did absorb. Did not have to reapply. Kept my son burn free while camping for a week on a Florida Keys Island this summer.

Great but expensive.

This stuff works great but whatever you buy, make sure it has No Oxybenzone and octinoxate , the two ingredients believed to contribute to coral bleaching.

Best sunscreen for Florida sun

Amazing sunscreen! Works extremely well! Use this for the whole family

After swimming the lotion leaves a milky look your skin.

It's good.

I specifically bought this because it was advertised as reef safe. But the 8oz bottle that I received contains Oxybenzone and Octinoxate. The description specifically states: "Tp help protect delicate reef ecosystems, our Sport sunscreen contains no Oxybenzone and no Octinoxate." Which is the first two ingredients listed under the Active Ingredients...sending back.

This works soooo good. I usually always burn but I didn’t get burnt once on our Caribbean cruise. This stuff also spreads far so it’s worth the money. I would definitely recommend putting it on in AC though. It seemed to rub in completely when I did that and only rubbed in 3/4ths of the way if I did it after I was a little sweaty. This is so good I’m gonna ditch the easy spray ons that don’t protect our ocean’s reefs!

I'm a very pale person with a history of melanoma, and I'm also very active outdoors in the summer. I needed something that would protect me completely so I could still enjoy my favorite activities. This is it. Amazing sun protection and a non-greasy formula. Will be buying this by the tub-full from now on!

My daughters and I used this and ended up with sunburns at the beach. We may have been sloppy with application (not reapplying), but my husband used our regular Walmart brand spray on and only got slightly red in places on his chest/back that hasn’t been exposed to sun much yet. And he did not reapply that either.

eos-eos

I’ve used blue lizard for over 7 years now on myself and my children. I found it to be the best sunscreen for our skin types. I have olive skin and my children have very pale skin and we have never experienced burns or skin reactions using it. The ingredients is what first drew me to using it, but the reliability has made me a lifetime user.

I bought this sunscreen to take with us on our trip to Jamaica in April . Unfortunately with the current events, we did not get to go on that trip. So, we decided to use the sunscreen this summer when we would go swimming in our local swimming pool, or family swimming pools. All of us got burnt everytime we tried to use it. We would even reapply every hour to hour and a half. It never felt like my skin was protected. I could literally feel myself burning like I didnt have sunscreen on at all. For my family, it did not work. I was very thankful we didnt try to use this product for the first time in Jamaica. We would have fried out on the ocean and then had a miserable trip.

This stuff is amazing! First off love that the bottle lets you know when you’re being exposed to dangerous rays. For example, we were under a beach umbrella and my husband thought he didn’t need sunscreen, bottle told us otherwise. Second thing I love: goes on smooth and easy. First application is the easiest, after water or sweating it takes a little more effort, but as long as you take an extra few minutes to rub things in, it’s awesome!
