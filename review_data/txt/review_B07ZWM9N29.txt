We had zero issues with this sunscreen. My wife is extremely sensitive to chemicals on her skin and she really liked it. It didn't leave a REALLY oily residue on the skin, as most sunscreens do. It has a very nice fragrance that we both enjoyed throughout the day. My wife is EXTREMELY sensitive to strong scents and was very able to tolerate the scent from this sunscreen. The only possible drawback is the beautiful fragrance may attract bugs, so I recommend use in an area with low level of flying bugs in the area.

Ordered a few days before heading to Florida and it arrived in plenty of time! Have used many organic sunscreen products (sprayed or lotion) but it would always be oily and sticky. On a hot sunny humid day...that is the last thing you want to feel on your skin! We knew it works because where I had missed after snorkeling in the Keys...it would show as burn lines and mostly by your bathing suite edge! I ended up buying more for gifts!!!

Best sunblock I have used. I was in the sun all day I usually burn but I didn’t at all

Great sunscreen! Loved it. Saved me from sunburn in the Caribbean.

Live this sunscreen. Brought it to Florida. Was in the sun for 4 weeks and never burned. Love that it’s totally organic. Highly recommend

It smells amazing and is organic. No harsh chemicals like the others. The kids love it too! Highly recommend!!!

Expensive but smells great and goes on nicely. So far, no burns!

Easy to apply. Goes on evenly. No greasy feel. Smells great

I love COOLA!! The scent, texture, coverage is all fantastic. Highly recommend. And it’s reef safe.

Very light weight, dries quick without any white residue and the smell is awesome

Great scent. Great protection and best of all reef friendly! Thank you

Doesn't work that well... not worth the price. I am a natural red head w/ tons of freckles and this stuff is mehh at best. I was out in the sun with this stuff on for 2 hrs and reapplied twice (I also put it on my kids w similar results). I still caught the sun!!! I did not burn but my freckles came in dark brown and looking like I'd been baking in an oven. Sun bum is wayyyy better, does not cause a reaction on my sensitive skin and is also cheaper. Don't waste your money on this! The coola mineral formula works better also.

Our family has been using Coola sunscreen for several years. This time we received genuinely looking bottles with absolutely horrible chemical smell. Kids refused to use it. No coconut smell whatsoever. Plus I got sunburn after applying it liberally. I wonder if Coola changed the formula or it’s a fake product. Anyway, it’s a bad product, I would never buy it again

I thought the advertising for this product was misleading. I thought I was buying a fairly natural product because of all the organic ingredients listed and highlighted in the product description. Upon arrival, I checked out the active ingredients and found that these sunscreens are all the chemical ones that I specifically try to avoid. No zinc oxide in this one! And much to my disappointment I can’t even return this product for a refund (guessing because it’s a spray-on?). So, now I’m left with paying $20 for a sunscreen I won’t ever use! Too bad!

LOVE that it’s a more natural continuous spray (no unnatural fragrance or toxins). However, gave it 4 stars bc I feel like the bottle didn’t last very long. Just a handful of uses and it’s almost out. So the bottle doesn’t contain as much as I’d hoped, considering this is more expensive too. Love the smell though as well!

The smell is so heavy and almost feels like a EDT deodorant. I was expecting something top quality, just don’t feel that way

eos-eos

The only thing about this sunscreen that makes it different from other sunscreens is the smell. If you’re purely purchasing for scent alone then I would give this spray 5 stars but personally I think this is just an over priced sunscreen that doesn’t give great sun protection.

I'm not a super big fan of the spray sunscreens, but bought for the convenience. Just tried for the first time. Will buy again

Great Product, Expensive

eos-eos

Not thrilled with this product. After several applications and applying liberally, everyone still got sunburn. And the smell is horrible!!!! Wouldn’t recommend, especially for the price. Not sure if this is fake or the real deal but wasn’t impressed!

eos-eos

We followed direction for application and my daughter still was getting so burnt!

eos-eos

I love coola products but this sunscreen doesn’t smell good at all!!

eos-eos

Product aerosol is not working properly. The product shoots out and does not spray as advertised. This is a non-returnable product.

I was super excited to try this product. Unfortunately I was disappointed as it smells horrible.

False advertising and fraud. You can't call your product "organic" if it's 70% organic. Such a joke.

eos-eos

This spray has the same active chemicals as the cheap store bought ones for quadruple the price. Also, not 100% natural or organic. I haven't used so I don't know how it smells. And no you can't return either. Down 25 bucks for a 5 dollar sunscreen!

I bought this for a recent trip to Hawaii. I got no sunburn, however the bottle went by fast. The smell was great, didn’t break out my skin, and wasn’t greasy like most spray sunscreens. I wouldn’t have this be my go to daily because of the steep price, but for a trip it was great.
