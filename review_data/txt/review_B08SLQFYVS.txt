I have been trying a handful of different mineral sunscreens. This one is very lightweight & sheer. Absorbs quickly & does not feel tacky or heavy. I have very fair skin & the tint does not really do much for coverage, but I am ok with that. What it does help with, in my opinion, is keep the white cast away. Doesn't stink. I have mature skin, so I feel like this is a perfect option for my face. I personally don't feel as if it is too shiny or oily.

I love the fact that this is reef safe... it absorbs well into the skin, but beware that the darker your skin tone, the higher the probability that there may be a slight white cast left after it sets down ( and it sets down quickly)- this white cast is nothing that cannot be fixed with a tinted moisturizer or light coverage foundation ... it does not pill, and leaves the sling hydrated all day long! It is my go to spf for day to day activities - there is also a 50 Spf - it too is lovely!

I have medium tan skin, acne prone skin and I have been searching and searching for physical sunscreen with 20% or above zinc oxide for ever. This sunscreen is it!! I got the rose scented and mild tinted one. I use two finger lengths every time. It's goes on like a dream. You would think it would be too much. It's not and it blends in and does not leave a white cast on my skin. It has a mild rose scent, I mean , really really mild. I love this sunscreen and I think I have finally found one which I can stick to.

If you’re like me and have super oily skin as soon as you step outside then this is for you. I use this sunscreen along with the ordinary niacinamide serum. Doesn’t make you look dry, smallest amount of glow but not oil and my pores look smaller. Love this so much. Will be using forever

High zinc but Goes on smooth and light with a little shimmer. I’m huge on sunscreen. Very hard to find such a high zinc product that feels like a pretty bb cream.

This smells great, leaves my skin feeling soft, and once it absorbs there is no sticky or tacy feeling left over!

This moisturizing sunscreen is medium consistency. I use it after I prep my skin with a rosewater toner. If I put a serum on underneath it, it feels heavy. With just the toner and this SPF moisturizer, I feel moisturized but not greasy. It also makes your skin appear Khloé and moisturized. I think that is why it’s called reflect, because it reflects the sun.

I got this sunscreen as a sample, i loved it so im glad i found it on Amazon

i’ve tried literally dozens of sunscreens. thankfully tried this and my skin approves

This product isn’t sheer, but I like the dewy glow it gives me. Great for days I’m not wearing make up.

Love this so much ! Slight neutral tint and spreads easily ! Will definitely purchase again. Just wish spf was higher.

Received a sample of this from Ipsy, absolutely love it, works great alone or under makeup

Smells and feels great

Love this sunscreen moisturizer combo! Blends well with every skin tone and it's not sticky on your face.

Best natural moisturizing sunscreen ever!!! My skin is radiant and protected. Never break out again!

I normally don’t like mineral sunscreens as they make my already pale skin look like I am dead… they also tend to not be water resistant but chemical sunscreens burn my eyes horribly so I’ve been trying different kinds. I like that this one has spf of at least 50 and that it is water resistant. It has a pleasant smell (vanilla like it says) the one thing I don’t like about it is that it does leave my face looking greasy. Like REALLY REALLY greasy. Hopefully that can be managed with mattifying powder or something. I would normally use beautybleander blotting sponges but since this is a mineral sunscreen I don’t want to risk moving the product and getting burnt.  Decided for give the original a try since I thought the tint of the original would match my skin perfectly and it does. I don’t like that it isn’t water resistant but I might try mixing it with the sport sunscreen to try and minimize the white cast of the sport version

Awesome stuff! Breakout prone skin in my 40’s and this product worked great under powder foundation. I got it before a trip to the Bahamas. I did not burn and my makeup stayed on all day. Sustained heat and water slides and splashes of water throughout the day.

I don't have long-term experience with Kinship but tried a small sample and decided to order a larger supply. I can tell more with continued use but so far, like this product.

Currently on accutane, and event before taking i had extremely dry skin. i live in Utah, so summers are as dry as they come. this sunscreen is great because it’s so hydrating for my dry skin, and it’s not heavy. i’m sure if you have an oilier skin type it won’t work, and there is a slight white cast on my light skin tone.

I had really high hopes for this product, but it felt as if I applied a jar of Vaseline on my face. It made my face appear extremely greasy. It did not, however, cause me to break out. That may be only because I used it for two days before stopping. I don’t see how this can be waterproof with it being so slippery and light.

Im sure it’s doing what it’s supposed to do, but it burns a little upon application, causing me to sweat shortly after. It also has a somewhat greasy/dewy look. I don’t think I’ll buy this again. Instead the SunBum Mineral Tinted sunscreen works better for my skin, and I imagine, many others since it is less harsh.

I have extremely oily skin, and based on some reviews thought this could work. Negative. Felt like I was just slopping on more oil onto my face and sits on top of my face, like a mask. Makes me feel like my face is going to break out at any moment. It hasn't yet, so that's a plus I guess. I just don't like how it feels on my face.

Smells like vanilla. It’s tinted so it leaves a weird cast but at least its not white.

I wanted to love this. I love Kinship and their mission. I have the mint mud mask and love it! This sunscreen is just too shiny and sticky for my oily / combo skin. It is so thin that it runs all over my face at the slightest sweat or humidity in the air.

In fairness I didn’t buy this on Amazon, but I’ve placed an order for it with subscribe and save. I received this in an Ipsy kit. Wow, talk about a great sunscreen. I love that it isn’t scented and that it doesn’t leave my face white and chalky looking. It is great for mature skin. I have wasted so much money on other sunscreens. Now I’ve hit the jackpot with this. Love love love it.

This sunscreen is SO GOOD. I absolutely love it. Non-toxic, reef safe, non nano!?! It would have been my perfect sunscreen. I have pale skin, but it doesn't leave a white cast. It's technically "tinted", but it sheers out completely so you can't see it. The only thing wrong with this is it has coconut oil, which is comedogenic (clogs pores). My skin isn't even that sensitive but it caused me to break out. I've heard a lot of people break out with this too. Kinship, please remove the coconut oil!!! And people with acne-prone skin especially, I would stay away from this one.

I bought this last summer and thought I didn’t like it until I tried 4-5 other mineral sunscreens. This one is lightweight, spreads nicely and does not settle into the lines of my face making me look old. This one is the winner for me and I will Continue to buy it.

It’s happened both times and I won’t put it on again

This product worked for my girlfriend with darker skin. She struggles with finding nourishing sunscreens that wont leave a weird film on her face. She loves the light weight feel and the sheerness!

Love this high percent mineral sunscreen no white cast on me slightly shiny look but almost natural and not a wet dewy feeling dries down nice. I have dry Olive medium tan skin. Love clean ingredients will deff repurchase!

I like the fact that for me it does not leave a white cast. and it is not heavy on the skin.
