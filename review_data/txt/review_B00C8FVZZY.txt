I have very sensitive skin and burn very quickly and easily. I live at the beach but wear long pants, long sleeves and a hat with sun-protective fabric - even in winter. I also wear sunscreen every single day. I ordered this product on a lark when intending to replace my usual Cotz. Bad idea. This stuff is dry and cakey. It looks terrible on the skin. I've noticed my sun spots getting darker this summer and that my face is way more tanned than usual. But last weekend was the last straw. I stood outside without a hat for about 15 minutes chatting with a neighbor but since I had my sunscreen on didn't worry much about it. Now I am peeling. Great. Look elsewhere. And I highly recommend Cotz, both its face and also its lip goo. It has never let me down. I use the one with the word "complexion" in the name and no need for makeup over it, although it's compatible. I'll be going back to it.

Sun protection is one of the best things you can do in terms of “anti-aging” and it also helps prevent skin cancer. We really all should be wearing it every day. The problem is most sun screen is really unpleasant to use on the face. I have tried dozens of facial sunscreens and this is definitely the best. It blends in well and doesn’t leave a white cast on my light/medium skin tone, it’s neither greasy or drying, it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and it sits well under makeup. I also think the price point is pretty good relative to other facial sunscreens. This tube is a generous 3oz, making it just $12 an oz. I highly recommend this product! *tip* as with any sunscreen, to get the full protection promised on the label you need to use 1/4 teaspoon of product on your face

A fabulous formulation, applies easily with no white residue. Non oily, which is great in a humid environment. Lightly tinted, but leaves no color on the skin. This particular version has no chemical sunscreens included.

Does not burn my eyes after wearing it and re-applying several hours into the day.

Love this. It’s only been 2 days but I love the look, feel, and the tint of this sunscreen. I have combination skin and this is the best sunscreen I’ve found so far. Some sunscreens are so drying that it makes the dry areas on my face look more dry and then others are too oily that I’m just a big grease ball and everything just sticks to my face. This one looks so smooth on my face. It does look a bit dry around my mouth lines at the end of the day but it’s not too bad. The tint is perfect for my fair skin! The other tinted sunscreens I tried are so dark and orange! This one is a light tint with a slight rosy tint. I have more of a warm complexion but this looks fine and you can’t really tell. Great for everyday use! Looks great under makeup too! I like to use a bb cream that’s a bit more oily so I have more of a glowy makeup look and it looks so nice!

My dermatologist suggested I start using this after I was diagnosed with Melanoma. I use it as a light daily face make-up. It is tinted and provides the sun protection I need.

I just purchased this 3 oz sunscreen lotion that I have been using for a long time from other suppliers, but I am going to send it back because it came with less than 2 oz. See the photo

I ordered this back in March and wanted to wait a bit to give it a review. First of all, i had extremely dry skin and this product was not for dry skin at all. Since it is tinted, my dry skin showed the lines of the tinted sunscreen and on my pimples, the sunscreen would form a dry circular look around them.  I started accutane in May, and my face got extremely more dry but I changed my whole skin routine and started to use this sunscreen again. I drink so so soooo much water now and the moisturizer I use (now) keeps my skin so hydrated I can wear this sunscreen so well. The zinc in the sunscreen also helps my skin become non-inflamed! This is honestly a great sunscreen but just make sure you’re well hydrated before you do apply this sunscreen because it did tend to peel when I was in my “dry-skin era”. I want to try the other sunscreens too because this brand is worth it!! I reccomend!
