It’s lightweight and not at all greasy. Feels great to put on. I have very sensitive skin and my face hasn’t burned yet. Great product!!

Arrived without a lid no seal and def had been used

Really moisturizing and silky. Not heavy and greasy like a lot of sunscreens.

Feels good on skin, weightless, not greasy. I still wore Concealer for my under eye and pics were good. 4 days in Caribbean and it protected my skin as it stated.

Great service. Great product.

Great for the skin to be protected by the sun. Only con I have for the body lotion is that it expires in a month. Face lotion is up to 2 years. Wouldn't buy the body lotion again, since I was sent an old one.
