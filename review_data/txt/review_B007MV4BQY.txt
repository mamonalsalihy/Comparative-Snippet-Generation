I wanted something easy for in my bag to grab and put on myself or kids quick. It seems to work like I had hoped but the smell of banana cream pie on my face is not my favorite. My kids seem to not mind it. I do love the small size and fits great even in a small purse.

This product is the size of a matchbox or smaller. Don't was your money and cannot return.

Sensitive , good scent, protects skin. Love it for the kids. I use it too.

I really like it because itâ€™s easy to use

Yeah, it's small, people. Read the amount you get. It's a solid stick, like a lip balm. So it's going to last a while. It isn't a ripoff. I put this in my purse and swipe it directly on my face and hands throughout the day. I've used it every day for a week and hardly made a dent in it. It smells sooooo good. Only bad thing is I've been breaking out and can't tell if it's from this or from another sunscreen I started using around the same time.

easy to put on, goes on clear, smells good, and seems to work well

I liked how it wasn't very sticky and didn't leave a white cast. it was also very light weight but I did started to breakout really bad and my skin got red.

Did not pay attention to size when ordering. It is SUPER TINY! About the length of a tube of chapstick.
