I love this sunscreen! I use it every year because it’s not thick and greasy like other sunscreens. It’s also not full of bad things for your skin. I highly recommend.

Not oily or greasy, very lightweight. Im fair complected so I burn easily. This keeps my face protected. Most sunscreens cause an acne breakout, but not this one! Can easily wear under makeup. I wear this everyday

This sun block goes on and doesn’t leave a film. It honestly feels like nothing is there while giving you great protection.

This is the only sunscreen I can convince my husband to wear. It applies on easily without the very potent sunscreen smell. It still smells of sunscreen but no where near as gross as most sunscreens. I put this on my kids, one of who has severe eczema. This does not break out any of our skin. I’ve purchased so many bottles of this over the years!

Lathering up with this sunscreen doesn't even feel like a chore, the water feel is what your skin wants, there no way else to say it. My skin was hydrated, protected, and loved for five hours of sun exposure. I applied once; swam, sun bathed, sweated and still, it remained. Not a hint of a burn.

After reading many on line reviews about "odorless". sunscreens I ordered this brand and product. It clearly says odorless on the product packaging. Don't be fooled, it has the exact same stinky smell as the Neutrogena product which is only half the price. It is in no way odorless and the smell is just as hard to wash off. Sigh, it seems that if I want a true odorless product I must return to the even more expensive products that are only sold at the doctors office........

Simply put, you’re dry enough, you don’t need a sunscreen that is going to dry you out worst or clog your pores!  (For those not familiar, accutane is an extremely potent acne medication, also known as isotretinoin)  This has an awesomely high SPF 60, is cooling and refreshing going on, can look a little greasy at first but dries down in about 10 minutes. It goes well under makeup and it’s the best of the LP line-up that I’ve tried whole on accutane, and I’ve tried several since my derm gave me samples.  Before accutane I tried their SPF mineral (the 3-4 oz bottle that was more affordable than the anthelios brand) and while it worked, it felt like spreading diaper rash ointment on my face and left quit a white case if I didn’t slather makeup on over.  This bottle is 5oz and such a better deal than many other face specific sunscreens but I definitely use this on my face and neck primarily. You need this. I’m not being paid to say so.
