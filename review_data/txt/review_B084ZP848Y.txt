We tried several mineral based sunscreens but always got sunburns... The key is that the sunscreen has to have BOTH Zinc and Titanium Oxide, as one protects against UVA and the other protects against UVB. Additionally, they have to contain sufficient levels of each of these to be effective. This sunscreen meets the bill and has worked successfully for entire days out climbing at high elevation (9000 ft)!

I work outdoors 50% of the time, need protection from the sun.... this stuff is awesome, no sunburn, very little tan. A little thick, I just put a little water on my hands, and it spreads great... haven't had any issues with burning my eye when I sweat, a big plus

Daily 2-4 hours surfing near the equator for 3 weeks. I liberally applied it to my scalp (male pattern baldness) and face, as well as shoulders, back & arms about 30 min before jumping in (some days I wore a sleeveless vest or long sleeve rash guard). EZ to spread. NO BURNING OF EYES! EZ to wash off with shampoo, soap & wash cloth. NEVER GOT SUNBURNED! When first applied, it leaves a very slight trace of a blue hue on me (blue lizard?), but Does NOT stain clothing. MY wife joined up with me 10 days into my trip and brought me another tube because BLUE LIZARD worked better WITHOUT burning my eyes— Neutragena spf 100 facial product was disappointing.

BLUE LIZARD Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50+ is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used. I don't like using chemical sunscreens and I have sensitive skin (fragrance allergy). This sunscreen goes on very white (as you'd expect with a mineral sunscreen), but it rubs in quite nicely to become clear (or nearly so). Unlike other mineral sunscreens I've used, it doesn't feel like you've got super thick foundation on your face. You soon forget that you've put it on. To test its effectiveness, I took my wristwatch off to reveal the pale white skin underneath. I put the sunscreen on my arms and then worked outside for over an hour in the Midwest sun. With no sunscreen, my watch area would have been bright pink and painful, but with this sunscreen, it was still as pale as before I went outside. That's good enough for me.

I have a shaved head and I play soccer in the AZ heat. Which means there’s nothing to stop the sweat from going into my eyes. Whenever I used a leading brand sunblock, it would sting my eyes to the point where I would wash off the sunscreen and deal with the sunburn later. NOT anymore!! I’ve used this once and it didn’t bother my eyes at all. I’m fact, I forgot I was wearing sunscreen.

We love Blue Lizard. Been using it for at least 8 years, maybe more. We prefer physical sun barriers over purely chemical ones. This is a physical one as it is meant to stay on the top of your skin. You are supposed to slather it very thick, to the point of looking painted, which we don’t do because frankly it looks ridiculous. But it still gives us good protection even with a lesser amount.

eos-eos

This item works great ... however, it does go on thick and does make your face white... but that's why it works so great! great to outdoor activities such as hiking and beach

eos-eos

I LOVE this sunscreen. It rubs in really great and does not trigger my sensitivity to scents. It works great as a sunblock. Highly recommend. Plus its supposed to be safer then conventional sunscreens. I prefer ones with zinc in them.

eos-eos

Perfect combo of no eye tearing even after wearing it all day and ease of liberal application which spreads evenly throughout. I’ll be getting this again and again!

eos-eos

I really like this sunscreen. I use it on my face. I sweat quite a bit and so most sunscreens burn my eyes. This one does not. It does go on white and takes a little bit before the white goes away. This does not bother me but might some other people.

eos-eos

This stuff kept my pasty-white self sunburn-free at a recent beach trip, no shade just direct sun for 3 days. It also rubs in better than other mineral sunscreens I’ve tried. Did make my face break out a little, but so do most sunscreens.

eos-eos

I am extremely fair skinned, sensitive skinned, and in the sun A LOT. I have yet to burn or be adversely effected by the sun when wearing this product. There is no unpleasant perfume or additives. It provides excellent coverage. It does go on thick and white, but with a little rubbing all is well. I actually prefer it that way because you can see when a spot has been missed. LOVE THIS!

eos-eos

It has thick consistency bus surprisedly feraly easy to spread on skin and stay longer than other brands. In concideration that it's not toxic and high sun protection rate the product is now my favorite!

eos-eos

Sensitive redhead skin… used it and didn’t burn! Will buy again

eos-eos

The only sunscreen I will use! It actually works and the cap turns blue when the UV index is high so you know to reapply often.

eos-eos

doesn’t burn skin and run into eyes like chemical sunscreens. may leave a white shear if you apply a good layer.

eos-eos

As an athlete in the sun a lot. I love this sun screen, I’ve been using it for 5 years. I would recommend this if anyone burns.

eos-eos

I love this sunscreen and i have never burned with it. It does turn white when it gets wet but i dont care bc it's excellent sunscreen!

eos-eos

Unlike other mineral sunscreens this one rubs in super easy and doesn’t leave you super white. I have very fair skin and it was my first time in the sun after winter and was in FL on vacation and didn’t get burnt at all! I love that it doesn’t have a scent as well. Highly recommend. This is my new go to sunscreen.

eos-eos

Blue Lizard provided great protection from sunburn and I still got a GREAT TAN that has lasted several months. My Mom said this was the best tan I have ever had and has held on for so long without me being in much sun after coming home from Cancun. I like that the top of package turns blue to warn of UV rays!

eos-eos

I use this on my face as well as my body with no issues. the white cast fades quickly and it doesn’t contain avebenzone which irritates my eyes. Love that it’s reef safe. And a little bit goes a long way!

eos-eos

Best sunscreen ever hands down

eos-eos

I had problems when I would sweat and the sunscreen I was using would get in my eyes. My eyes would itch and burn for hours. This is thick, and I used very little. It protected my skin, and I had no eye irritation problems.

eos-eos

We don’t buy any other brands

eos-eos

Great product

eos-eos

The sunscreen worked really well. I just spent a week in Aruba and did not burn at all. I reapplied as directed. It goes on white and does take awhile to rub in. It is greasy though and may not work for all skin types. My skin is very sensitive and I did not have any adverse reactions to it.

eos-eos

Have used this in the past--great protection, long lasting, all mineral, no eye sting, and--given all that--*reasonably* easy to rub in (ie, somewhat better than many other formulations with zinc oxide/titanium oxide)

eos-eos

My niece uses this on her kids. Nice mineral sunscreen with no obnoxious scent and won’t sting your eyes.

Recommended by doctor as prone to skin cancer

Best sunblock ever. My child and I are both fair skinned gingers. He is very sensitive to sunblock burning his neck and this doesn't burn at all. We both applied in mornings and very rarely had to reapply. Neither one of us burned at all this summer.

For my arms and face

Sunscreen worked very well, while we were vacationing in Aruba. Would definitely continue to use.

Went out in the kayak. Out in the sun and water all day. The blue lizard worked great. I usually burn easy but I did not burn using the Blue Lizard! Great product.

eos-eos

This is the first sunscreen I’ve ever used that doesn’t feel gross on my face and doesn’t burn or sting.

eos-eos

Applied to face 30 minutes prior to swimming. Developed extreme skin rash on neck and upper chest. Required prescription steroid over rash for five days. Skin healed in eight days. Will never use again. Have no prior history of oral or topical drug allergies. Small print describes multiple chemical ingredients. Something in this product caused intense skin reaction

eos-eos

The sunscreen serves the purpose well. I am disappoint that I ordered 2 tubes and the expiration date is January 2022. I expect the expiration date to be at least a year out on products that I order.

eos-eos

Was hoping to use this on my face daily but hasn’t worked out. While it’s great for the body, it doesn’t work for my face. It’s very thick and oily. I have normal skin, but when I use the 1/2 teaspoon dermatologists recommend, my face is slathered with grease. A certain amount is absorbed, but way too much is left on the surface. I even tried using no moisturizer and just this, but it was still too oily. Love that it’s reef safe and that it works well as a block. Wish they made one that is lighter.

eos-eos

This stuff is awesome however the lid is awful. The sunscreen gets stuck in and all over the cap. It’s so messy. It’s hard to open. Etc,. I don’t know why it’s called a smart cap. It’s really really a bad design. Also the sunscreen is pretty runny so if you don’t snap the “smart” cap right, you’ll have a mess on your hands and sink or wherever you lay it down. I stand it up with the lid up (leaning against the wall on my sink as not to make a mess).  PLEASE REDESIGN YOUR CAP????

eos-eos

This sunscreen doesn't leave a white overcast, which is what I was looking for. It rubs in very well and only has a slight smell that doesn't really bother me that much. But it does leave my face very moist, it feels like I've been sweating when I put it on and my glasses slip down my nose after applying. Putting some setting powder on after helps.

eos-eos

I use this when I'm going to stay home and work in the yard. There is an obvious white cast that does dissipate slightly, but I so confident in the sun protection that I'm keeping it. Plus -- first brand I've found that does not sting my eyes and has no smell whatsoever.

eos-eos

Have used other Blue Lizard products but this one gave me a skin rash that looked like I had been burned and don't ask me about the itching. The first time I used i, I was convinced I must have somehow touched poison oak/ ivy, not imagining it could be the sunscreen. But once it healed which took a week, I used it a second time and had another week of hell. My suggestion, test it first on a small area. Hopefully you won't go through the same misery.

eos-eos

This sunscreen provides great protection. It does leave a white tint when applied but better the tint then a burn.

eos-eos

I gave this 3 stars b/c it worked nicely on my kids. Unfortunately, I decided to try this on my face. It made my skin swell, hurt, and itchy. It felt like my face was on fire. I don't recommend if you are aware that you have sensitive skin.

eos-eos

Too Greasy, Stays Wet on Skin so No Good for Surfing as it makes board slippery.

eos-eos

When I sweat, this sunscreen runs down my arm and concentrates in the elbow creases. The appearance is unimportant to me but I do not like that the thickness of the sunscreen elsewhere is reduced due to the sunscreen running. This is only from a 30 minute run in 60s F temperature and I probably sweat less than an average person. I might try the active product from the same brand or a sport sunscreen from another brand. My skin is fairly sensitive but I will consider this a lesson learned that one needs to order sport or active sunscreens for them to stay put.

eos-eos

I was looking for a thinner screen but with zinc and tried this one. It works well but I found it hard to wash off even after a few showers and my skin seemed to dry out a little too. I do think it’s much better protection than spray screens.

eos-eos

I purchased this in hopes of a good facial sunscreen. It goes on like white paint. I was shocked how strong the white cast is. On the other hand it's definitely water resistant because it was hard to get off my face, even using soap. If you don't mind a white cast. Go for it.

eos-eos

not a fan. turns white on skin and looks ridiculous and doesn't rinse off except with a lot of soap & water, for some this might not matter. I'll stick to Sun Bum brand

eos-eos

It might of been a great sun protector, but come on it wouldn’t come off. It took four baths to get it off

eos-eos

Disliked the amount of rubbing to get it to absorb into skin. Disliked the whote to pale color it leaves your skin.
