When it comes to sunblocks, Banana Boat is a brand that I can trust and rely on as the best protection against sun for my children. I've used them ever since my children were babies and they never had any problem with it.  One time, I bought a cheap, genetic brand instead to save money and learned the lesson the hard way because it was runny and stung my children's eyes really badly that they were crying in pain. Ever since then, I never even looked at any other brand and I just go straight to the Banana Boat.  They are a bit pricey compared to other brands but you get what you pay for and I don't want to compromise my children's safety and comfort for couple of dollars in savings.  I now buy them during the winter and off-season when the prices come down since I know I will need them in the summer. So stock them up before the summer if you know you will be spending time at the pool or beach in the upcoming summer! Hope this was useful... and if it was, please click on the helpful button below. Thank you!

This is some of the best sunscreen I have ever tried/used. I have tried them all, I am a sunscreen fanatic. I have tried the most expensive to the least. I know what to look for. Mineral sunscreen wise this is my favorite and best one I have tried. I am an adult and I use it daily. The smell is amazing! The foam application is so easy. It is spreadable and doesn’t do the piling like other sunscreens. My all time favorite sunscreen is the Zo Skin Health sunscreens. But they are so expensive. I use their Broad Spectrum one and it’s mineral just like this one. The difference? It’s far more expensive than the Banana Boat Mineral Foam and it’s super white, and not as spreadable. I have heard the more white in the mineral sunscreens the more protection. Regardless this Banana Boat Mineral Foam is the best mineral sunscreen available in my opinion. This is the only sunscreen I have ever tried that has NO SUNSCREEN SMELL! I love that. Hands down the best mineral sunscreen you’ll find at a drugstore. I discovered it at CVS, but I repurchased it on Amazon because the pricing was a lot better on Amazon compared to the drug stores in my area. Thank you Banana Boat! This stuff is awesome! If anything make the blue one smell more blue raspberry like. Gosh these smell so good I love the Green Apple one.

I have blonde hair and very pale skin. I never go out in the sun, so you can imagine my concern upon learning that we were taking a cruise to Aruba, Bonaire, and Grand Turk. I am ghost white, but I really wanted to enjoy some time in the sun and the water. I chose this suntan spray because of the SPF and the lack of strong scent. While I still burned a little, it was far LESS than I ever expected, especially since I went snorkeling two days in a row. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who has very fair skin and does not want to get severely burned. Just make sure to reapply every 60-80 minutes if you are in the water. Also, it does rub off, so reapply if you dry off / wipe down with a towel.

I wear sunscreen on all of my exposed skin every day, from March til October. It's extremely difficult to find something that doesn't feel gross on my skin, doesn't leave white residue on whatever I touch, provides great sun protection, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I was so happy when I found this, because it checks all the boxes for me. It also doesn't have any lasting fragrance, which is great since I don't want to smell like sunscreen 8 months out of the year.

This is the only spray my daughter will let me put on her thanks to the no-sting formula! As a toddler with constantly scraped knees she hates the sunscreen that burns (due to alcohol). She now verifies it is the one with the soccer ball each time before she lets me spray her! This has been a game changer in the daily sunscreen battle at our house! I use the stick on her face and neck and spray her arms and legs!

Bought these for vacation/ the pool time because the sun hates me. I usually lurk from shadow to shadow, while under a hat with long sleeves in an attempt to only get a mild sunburn for the day. I get sunburn if I even think of going outside. This stuff works really well as long as it is reapplied often. Perfect for outdoor use, and for torturing loved ones with a freezing cold mist on their back! :)

We are adults that love using this product. It is thick and this ensures you use the right amount of product to achieve the SPF value. Like that it doesn't sweat off easily and the color (that fades) helps to ensure to cover up and don't miss any spots. The fragrance is ok. * tip for use, this product will go on best if you are outside and in warm or hot conditions because it sort of melts into your warmed skin. Another product would be better if you are trying to achieve a lot of coverage before you are outside, say, indoors in air conditioning prior to going outside.

I never liked using aerosol sunscreen before I found this brand. This banana boat sunscreen does the job without choking you with aerosol after-fumes. It’s a good product and you won’t be disappointed in your purchase.

My grandkids love this! No fuss to put sunscreen on

We start off the day with a lotion and advance to a spray when out and about. This product is easy to apply and does a great job. Just make sure not to spray into the wind -- yes, I've done it -- or near anyones face. Confession time...we all use it...not just the kids!

My son got a severe sunburn at daycare using another product and has not had another burn since we switched. Even the daycare staff really like the quality of this product. It does stay on in the water because I had to really scrub it off of him in the shower but well worth it!

eos-eos

I'm nearly 50 and LOVE this stuff. Yes... it smells nice but the color changing helps us fair skinned folks ensure we are completely covered. No more missing a spot!

This is great for women with Melanin that do not feel like tanning. I don’t have a problem with being darker but it does make me have to change makeup shades which is a hassle.. but with this sunblock I was able to stay in the water without being toasted by the sun. You must apply every 2-3 hours but it’s worth it

My mother is pure Irish and my dad is english/German so I burn even in the SHADE...thia product is a godsend as I direct traffic ALL day in the sun and I'm 60yrs old.wouldnt consider another season with this product. To me it's tear free as I've had no issues

My boys are rough and tumble all summer long and often have cuts/scrapes/etc. They HATE putting sunblock on because it stings in those spots. This formula has been great - it seems to last, it doesn't sting so we don't have to cover the cuts, and it goes on evenly. The spray top hasn't clogged at all - an issue I have with other brands. We're happy and sunburn free!

Very easy to put on and leaves no white residue

Redheads in this family that burn easily. This stuff is the only product we have found that works! Beach, pool, everyday. Highly recommend for the entire family.

This goes on great and is easy to use. Scent is fine, doesn't sting my kids and doesn't require any rubbing. Will buy again!

Love the protection while the kids are swimming. Also one of the best features is it being "Sting-free." Nothing is worse than when the kids rub their eyes and they start stinging from the sunscreen, and there is only so much you can do to help them. This is now my go-to sun screen.

Ordered this for my husband who is very fair completed, or as I call it pigment challenged. Kept him from burning and I didn’t have to rub it in. Spray and go

Bought this pack of 2 for the price of one in store. Lets pray it helps with this HOT Arizona weather!!

Easy to apply sunscreen for tge kids. Doesn't sting and is thick just in case they sweat. 2 pack.

As always, banana boat has a great product. It works perfectly and unlike a few other brands, my kids had no adverse skin reactions as they do have sensitive skin. Not foolproof once wet, so I recommend applying at leafy 20-30 minutes prior to getting wet, but otherwise a great sunblock for the whole family.

eos-eos

It’s easy to use as it is spraying. Bottle has nice design with cap lock after use. Nice little bottle won’t last very long but convenient enough to carry in bags to use again after two hours. Recommended!

Being a red head, I am always looking for the highest spf out there, and this has been the best BY FAR that I have found. I burn SO easily, but we bought several of these for a week long trip to Florida and I am so glad I did. We spent all day in the sun, every day and I never got burned, not even a tiny bit. Total life save!

The kids loved this ! The color is fun for them. Have you ever tried to get sunblock on a toddler ? They actually sit still for this !

My kid loves the flavor and it is easy to use as well. More protective and skin-friendly.

No sunburn on all 4 family members after using on a weekend spent at the lake. No eye discomfort for my 1 or 7 year old.

We have ran into issues when using the spray with having our kids open their eyes after and them stinging. This did not sting their eyes at all. It's great.

I do take the time to write review when I know the will help others! This is the best sunscreen that I have ever found! My daughter has Atopic Dermatitis.....this is the ONLY sunscreen that she can use that will not break her out and provides highly effective sunscreen. She is not a baby anymore and I still go to this! I use the spray for her hairline and ears. While I prefer the lotion for her face and body. Hands down the best!

My kids were able to enjoy the beach without a harsh sunburn. Banana Boat sunscreen kept my children well protected from the harsh rays of the sun. Even after 4 hours on the beach, the sunscreen kept them covered.

I wear 50 sunscreen and this product really doesnt sting if you sweat and it gets in your eyes. A lot of other products that say they are for use on children do sting so it is important to choose wisely.

Does not burn eyes like other sunblocks works great for someone working outdoors alot

This was our 3rd day at Disney World and our 7th day in Florida. The babies and I had it applied as directed and didn’t get red at all. Great product!!!

My 5 year old loved it and it helped her put sunscreen on by herself

This is the only sunscreen I have ever used on my toddler. Started using it when she was 7 months old and still love it. Living in FL we stay in our pool and or at the beach year round. I even use it myself if we are at the beach all day.

My 15 month old is Irish and is white as can be. I use this on hi everytime he’s outside because I do not need him getting sunburn. Great product, smells good, doesn’t sting or burn him when I spray it on. Highly recommend this product.

This by far is the only sunscreen I like to use its so easy to put on the kids and it's refreshing and not cold lotion coming out the bottle. Takes about 3 minutes to put it on and rub it in a bit and your good to go !

This is the best brand I have found to use on my kids. I won't switch from them! And this two pack deal is a great buy!

Easy to use, dries quickly and doesn't have a scent so great for kids!

Went on a multi family vacation to palm beach. I purchased 2 2 packs of this sunscreen for my 3 yr old. Overkill probably but being a single father I didn’t wanna hear the baby mother complain when we got back if he had a sunburn. So I used this on me and my son for our beach and fishing adventures. My son has tan lines but didn’t burn, unfortunately the other family almost all got sun poison from using target brand.

THE BEST 100 SUN SCREEN LOTION YOU CAN BUY. I LOOKED AT WALMART/ CVS/ WALLGREENS AND COULDNT FIND ANY OF THIS AMAZON HAZ IT AND I WILL BE BUYING MORE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES TO SWIM, THIS IS REALLY THE BEST IV FOUND FOR HER, SHE WAS VERY LIGHT SKINNED THE FIRST OF SPRING. WE LIVE IN FLORIDA, SHE IS A VERY TAN LITTLE GIRL NOW. BUT SHE NEVER BURNED , WITH THIS ON.. IT IS VERY GOOD..

Always buy kids sunscreen. It seems to stay on better and if it gets in your eyes it doesn’t sting.

This is the only product I will use on my four-year-old son. It keeps him from getting burn in the Sun. I love the fact that you can just spray it and don't have to put lotion on them.
