This milky sunscreen is less oily than other sunscreen formulas. My wife really likes it and she is coming back to me to give her more. A man has got to do what a man has got to do. This product will please your wife too.

Love this spf! Ive already stocked up since they keep increasing the price. It spreads so easily and its a primer and a spf in one! I love my skin after using this. I have oily skin and this spreads so easily and i feel no stickiness at all. Go for it

Good sides . It not oily , smells good , easy to apply.  Bad sides , is not good for sensitive skin , for very hot weather. If you want something to protect you from 85 degrees +. This is not the best product. Would not buy again . Overpriced

This is one of the most reliable sunscreen on the market. No greasy feelings, absorb fast and leave no white coats. I can do make up on it with no problems. Great product
