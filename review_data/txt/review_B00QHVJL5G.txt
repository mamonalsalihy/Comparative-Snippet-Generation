I love how sheer this sunscreen is; hopefully, I can find it easier next time.  Cotz Flawless Complexion Tinted SPF 50 Vanishing Zinc oxide - FACE  I used the two-finger rule for application with application to my face and neck.  Photos show initial application, 15 minutes after, 2nd application (2hrs after first), 20 minutes after 2nd application. Both applied using the 2-finger rule.  Definitely a 5/5 for now until I've used it for a month or two.

I found the one!! This isn't ashy at all and I don't have to rub my face into oblivion for it to smooth out. Give it a minute to sink in and you're golden :) Also very smooth texture and no smell that I can notice. Isn't super greasy but definitely adds a pretty glow/bit of moisture. New fave!!!

I‚Äôve used Cotz sunscreens for at least 12 years. First, there was Fallene Total Block and then the truly excellent Plus SPF 58. As a rosacea sufferer with extremes sensitive skin, a sunscreen that could protect my skin while providing a tint to cover redness AND not irritate my skin seemed impossible. But after years of searching, I found Cotz and never looked back. I used it in all sorts of climates, from hot sunny days to ridiculously humid. With a hat, sunglasses, and Cotz I never burned and my rosacea rarely rebelled.  Last year, Cotz made significant changes and discontinued the Plus SPF 58. This new product is simply inferior. It irritated my skin to the point of needing to wash it off. I gave it several chances and the same happened each time. I later found out bismuth oxychloride is a likely irritant.  What a shame for Cotz to make such a change for the worse. Also, the new packaging looks very amateurish and silly. It‚Äôs sad to lose such a dependable product which was a godsend for those of us with give most sensitive skin.

I've had adult acne for the past 11 years. Nothing too severe, but I'd always have a pimple or two on my chin or forehead despite regular cleansing, face masks, and using "oil controlling" moisturizers. I bought this when I ran out of my red bottle of "Cotz Plus," which I used as a face sunscreen when I would be out in the sun all day during the summer. The red bottle stuff was too heavy for everyday use and also clogged my pores. I only intended for the Flawless Complexion bottle to replace my sunscreen, not to become my everyday SPF moisturizer, but now I will never go back! This sunscreen is unbelievable! It is the only product out of all of the sunscreens and SPF moisturizers that I have tried in 20 years that I can use on my face every. single. day. and it won't make me break out. My skin is finally CLEAR. People with severe acne may not experience the same results, but if you have one or two small pimples all the time like I did, it might be the products you're using.  The color is great. It's very lightly tinted and blends to a natural finish on my pale skin. Neither mat nor shiny. There is no unpleasant smell. The only area where the product is lacking is in hydration: it doesn't do enough moisturizing for my nose, and there I sometimes need a base layer of moisture during the day. At night I use heavier moisturizers.

OMG! I've been buying every fragrance free mineral sunscreen on the market looking for the perfect one. I just combined a little of the Cotz Flawless Complexion Tinted SPF 50 with a full dose of untinted Prime and Protect and BUYA!!!! PERFECT for light, sensitive skin!!! üòò‚ù§Ô∏èüòç

I am a professional makeup artist and one of the most important products in my kit is SPF. Finding a non greasy, non white sunblock that works well under foundation is very important. I've been using Dermalogica and Kiehl's for the past few years. I received a sample of this in one of my beauty bags and I fell in love. It has a skin tone color just out of the tube but blends into a thin, invisible cream that is not greasy - not completely matt, but not greasy. It works great under liquid or cream foundation. I use it on myself too. I am very pleased with this and will definitely buy again.

I have previously used CoTZ FACE Natural-Tinted SPF 40, which worked perfectly for me as a foundation in the summer. It was thick and creamy and left a perfect matte coverage. There was a enough tint and coverage, that I didn't even need to wear powder on top of it. I have fair to medium skin tone. THIS product, however, is NOT the same. This is a thin lotion, and if you are looking for a sunscreen to wear under make-up, it's probably fine. It is not too greasy, but it does NOT have a matte finish. I was disappointed in this purchase, as another review had said this was matte and thick enough to be a foundation, but it isn't for me.  However, If you want a thicker product that DOES work like foudation, the CoTZ facial primer in the 1.5 oz tube is what you want. :D It used to come in a red and white tube, but they have changed the packaging. They also sell it in both tinted and non-tinted. So be sure you choose the correct one.  It has no odor whatsoever, and - yes - it does moisturize.

I've been using this sunscreen for a few years. My skin is pale, slightly olive, and I tan pretty easily. About 9 years ago, I started noticing brown splotches on my face. I used a skin lightening cream, which worked, but then I found out how bad they are for you...So my skin worsened during my first pregnancy seven years ago. I started using this or the other Cotz sunscreen religiously and I changed my diet (mostly plant based, but not perfect). My skin has been slowly improving over the past 3 years despite another pregnancy. They are barely visible now. I apply this sunscreen every day. If I forget and am outside even just a little, I can see the spots worsening again. As far as this sunscreen goes, it has a nice tint that blends with my skin pretty well. It gives a bit of a glow. I do have to use moisturizer underneath, but other than that, I just use this and a bit of concealer.

I am not a sunscrean wearer because of the residue they leave, the ghostly/shiny look, the sticky feel of it on the skin etc. I tried many low to high $$ but they did not get on my face more than once. I used them as a body sunscreen instead. I get a lectures from my demetologist everytime I visit him for not wearing sunscreen. Finally, I did some research and found this one. Decided to give it a try. When I was placing the order, deep inside I kind of knew the plight of this sunscreen. I have applied it for a few days now. I like it. Blends well with my olive skin tones. I even went for a walk after applying it. It did not make irritate my eyes. First day, the face wash did not get the etire product off my skin. I use a mild cleanser. Now I use a makeup remover towlette wipes to get it off my skin before clensing my skin. So far so good. Getting used to it. I will keep using it.

This is hands down one of my favorite sunscreens. I have olive skin tone and it seems to match perfectly. It offers some moisture and looks like I am wearing nothing. It does not offer any coverage or skin evening- if you are looking for that. If you want a little coverage the 40spf CoTZ tinted sunscreen offers a matte finish and a little coverage. I use it like foundation in the winter and summers. A little blush, mascara and then on my way!

I have been on the hunt for a mineral sunscreen that won't leave my face dry and or with that signature white cast. My search ended once I tried this sunscreen!!! My skin is medium-dark toned and many tinted mineral sunscreens still leave me with a white/beige cast. This CoTZ sunscreen blends right in with minimal rubbing. It is a bit on the oily side (which I prefer) but it settles in nicely for me after 10-20 mins. If you have oily skin it may be a little heavy for hot/humid weather. I did not have any issues with reapplications throughout the day and also appreciated the added bonus of iron oxides for some visible light protection. I've ordered a second tube!

eos-eos

Usually but this from Ulta, but I was down to the last drop and they were closed during the pandemic so - good old amazon always comes through! Been using this for years living in Arizona so I need that SPF50 and haven‚Äôt found anything better, especially for African Americans. It‚Äôs lightly tinted so it blends very well with my tanned caramel skin color; a little goes a long way. Can be used under your everyday makeup too, but I like how flawless my skin looks with just this.

eos-eos

Have used this and the tinted by Cotz. I like them both, but they are different. I do not wear foundation, but the tinted is a little thicker, and covers skin flaws (decreases my brown sun spots). This goes on pale, but soaks in, and looks like you have nothing on! I do not find it greasy, or shiny. I am pale, but I live in Florida, so am more tanned than many living farther north. This is less expensive, and is a larger tube than the Cotz tinted. They are both tinted..... I try other zinc based sunscreens, but I keep coming back to Cotz. It is the best, for not being greasy, or looking like a ghost, and providing sunscreen without harmful chemicals!

eos-eos

This is a great product for me. I am very fair skinned and burn easily and my skin is also very sensitive ( many sun blocks result in a stinging & slightly burning sensation). This product is a bit of a finishing cream - I don‚Äôt wear base, it moisturizes my always dry skin and protects me from burns. I can‚Äôt ask for much more than all that.

eos-eos

I needed some sun protection but didn‚Äôt want to pay $36. I tried this and my HSA paid for it. Plus I needed to buy more foundation. Bam. I have it all now. I love this stuff. It‚Äôs light and soft and my skin looks good. I can use it alone as a foundation. I actually used another brand with a shimmer tone mixed in to give me some highlighted effects. I‚Äôm 41 with dry skin. It looks pretty good and I‚Äôll def buy it again.

eos-eos

I love this so much! I have dark skin and this leaves NO white cast at all. I was kinda scared when I first put it on since its very beige, but just rub it in and it‚Äôll look invisible. I also have dry skin so I appreciate the thicker feeling of this product and the glowiness it leaves me with. AND ON TOP OF THAT, it has iron oxides in it too. I found my holy grail sunscreen (and it‚Äôs a great price)!!

eos-eos

So most mineral sunscreens have a bad rep for leaving noticeable white casts on darker skin tones but this didn‚Äôt! When the packaging says vanishing they mean it. It blends in seamlessly into the skin. The texture is nice it‚Äôs a little more dense but not too thick. For my skin it leaves a satin matte finish which I love! It‚Äôs also a really good price for the amount of product you get, I highly recommend!

eos-eos

My melanated people, this is the mineral sunscreen for you. After seeing Youtuber Avrolynne reviewed this product I had to get it. NO WHITE CAST! NO WHITE CAST! Also, it's sunscreen, not a foundation, if you are looking for coverage go get a makeup with sunscreen.

eos-eos

the tint looks very light but totally blends in. i have brown olive skin and i can apply two or more layers of this sunscreen. my only caviat is that it is very moisturizing and can be pretty dewy. other than that i love that it's tinted, mineral and works on my skin tone

eos-eos

Finally a Sunscreen that's brown skin friendly! It works it's not super greasy (though if you have oily skin I wouldn't used a moisturizer under this because it might be too much). Blends right into my skin. It's kind of thick but I feel it'll be great for fall winter but I wouldn't use this in the warmer months

eos-eos

Recommend to dry to normal skin. Not oil and absorb very quickly. Make a beautiful sheen on my skin. Keep moisture to my dry skin. No conflict with my following foundation and concealer. Not white like a clown even using a lot. No stress feeling after using.

Ive been using Cotz for a while now and its absolutely the best sunscreen ive bought, the tinted one does not leave white for darker skin colors it just blends well. it doesnt dry out my face which is fantastic and very good for the environment, ingredients are great.

this is an absolutely fantastic product for summer it's a perfect sunscreen in never comes off stays in place all day you can add a little bronzer blush and go for the day you're good to go I have very fair skin live in Florida nothing gets through it you cannot get a better product for a better price fantastic

Just all around a great product for a mineral based tinted sunscreen. Great price point and it rivals some of the $65 products I‚Äôve bought before. I have dry skin so this does very well for me. They have several other products to choose from.

I am enjoying this product. It goes on smoothly, blends into my (deep) complexion really well. I use it on my face and neck.  I will definitely purchase it again!

My daughter is very very picky about sunscreen. I am less so, but still don't like lots of chemicals or white residue smeared all over myself. This is the perfect sunscreen! Lightly tinted like cover up, no scent...goes on easily...we both adore it and highly recommend it!

eos-eos

Absolutely wonderful mineral sunscreen! I'm a Fitzpatrick Skin Type 4, it leaves absolutely no white cast or even an off colored tint. No scent either.. I would say, however, that it is quite shiny. For those who don't want a shine, I don't recommend this, but I personally prefer shine over sun damage haha

Tinted zinc oxide without the ghost look.

I love this stuff! Provides a light tinted. Feels dry and silky going on. Not greasy at all.

CoTZ is simply the best full spectrum sunscreen! It protects, applies easily & looks great.

If you are a woman of colour this is the sunblock for you!! It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve tried that does not look ashy!!!! It is tinted so I recommend getting dressed before applying and also removing it before u rest your face on a pillow, but I‚Äôm in love with this man one.

I‚Äôm on my second tube. This works great - I use it when I go running or to the pool. I haven‚Äôt had any bumps or reactions. It‚Äôs got a nice tint so that I‚Äôm not all white like I am with most mineral sunscreens.

Provides true sunscreen protection and when mixed with my favorite foundation provides a lovely dewy glow! No more primer for me! Can NOT live without this product. BTW similar products are twice the price.....

No white cast on my medium brown skin, no irritation (I have very sensitive skin). Will highly recommend.

It's the best sunscreen I have found. As a ski instructor, I need something strong. This works better than other brands with a 70 protection. I have fair skin and have to apply sunscreen every couple of hours. This is the only one that actually protects me so that I don't burn at all and doesn't clog my pores. The light tint is also nice as it serves as a light foundation.

My recent favorite mineral sunscreen. Easily get absorbed and be applied

It is creamy and mixed well with other products. Unfortunately, it says "tinted" and it is not. The previous product I bought was darker. It should specify, " light-tint" instead.

So disappointed. The ingredients shown in close up image do NOT match the zoomed out image, which lists bismuth ozychloride as first ingredient -and lists Mica further down. Both are pigments with uneven and scratchy surfaces, which notoriously cause itching and burning for those with sensitive skin. I NEVER would have purchased this if I could actually SEE the bismuth Oxychloride listed in the ingredients, and I recommend that you run away from this if you have sensitive skin. Hopefully Cotz will actually update this listing to include the correct ingredient information in the product details, which is a necessity for people using Amazon with mobility or vision issues.

It‚Äôs hard to find a mineral sunscreen that‚Äôs not drying or one that doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast and this one does neither. I am fair and have dry skin and this sunscreen works well with me. It gives a hint of color and is easy to apply.

eos-eos

One of the best one you can get. It goes very smooth

eos-eos

It is extremely greasy to me. If I put it on my freshly washed and toned skin, it will remain ‚Äòwet‚Äô the entire day following. It never dries or sets, so I have taken to mixing with a bit of my foundation to get it to dry enough to powder the top. I realize that mixing it dilutes the sun protection factor, but this would be unusable to me if I couldn‚Äôt get it to set.  Also, I don‚Äôt find it ‚Äòmoisturizing,‚Äô per se. I find it greasy feeling, which is not moisturizing. I have dry skin under my eyes and on my forehead and this has yet to moisturize my skin after several years of use.  I will continue to use it because it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve found so far, and I would recommend it to friends. I also mix in a bit of the Cotz SPF40 sunscreen to matte it a bit, and that helps, too. But then I look very orange, so the foundation I add in, which has a greenish tint, counteracts that a bit. Yeah...it‚Äôs a whole process, lol

Fantastic dewy finish. Gives a brightening effect. Prolly not what you want if you have oily skin.
