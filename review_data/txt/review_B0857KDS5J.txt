Really fortunate to come across this sunscreen. It is a mineral sunscreen (uses zinc oxide instead of active chemicals) with UVA/UVB SPF 50 protection. It doesn't feel oily, and it rubs in almost perfectly clear. Easy and comfortable to wear. Biggest test was the kids, and they had no complaints!

It‚Äôs so hard to find good sunscreen that is totally gentle and still high SPF. Two Peas is a great choice when you want protection without harmful chemicals. I love that it is broad spectrum, water resistant, and I scented. It‚Äôs a thick cream and provides thorough coverage.  This sunscreen uses zinc oxide, so it does come with the characteristic white hue, but it is a great choice for babies & little kids or people with sensitivities or allergies. It‚Äôs also a really nice choice for a primer under makeup. It dries down nicely and when you need SPF 50 for a day in the sun, this could add an undetectable layer under your foundation!

My daughter has very sensitive skin. Every sunscreen we try has caused her skin to become do irritated that she cries when we try to reapply throughout the day because it hurts. I've bought all of the brands (Avon, Burt's Bees, Neutrogena). This goes on soooo thick. To that point that you can no longer rub it in. I thought I was doing something wrong or applied too much (pea size amount is enough for the face). But I gave it a few minutes and it absorbed. She didn't burn at all and it never hurt so she had no issues letting me reapply. This was such a good purchase and w finally found the one that works. We'll worth the cost.

I‚Äôve searched for an organic sunscreen for my husband ever since he developed skin cancer on his face. We received the tube of Two Peas Organics and he loved it from the first squeeze. It goes on white but if you rub in together in your hands before you apply it, it goes on clear. I feel good knowing he‚Äôs protected and the ingredients are organic.

Im a surfer and need really good coverage that doesn't wash off easily and has healthy, non-toxic ingredients. This sunscreen does it all. I love it. It stays on for a good 2 hours surf session and doesn't irritate my skin

Great product! Quickly becoming a necessity on my bike rides. Love the all natural ingredients and it‚Äôs 25% zinc which helps with the protection. With the natural oils in there, recommend massaging the tube before uses. Going to recommend to my friends with kids.

I'm always weary about using products on my children. I get nervous because one has pretty bad eczema. The slightest change of products could cause her skin to flare up. However, I love this one so far. It's thicker than anything I've ever used before and requires much less. It is hard to squeeze out the bottle but a little goes a long way. This summer we plan to use it heavily.

I wanted a healthy sunscreen that worked well for both me and my toddler, and I definitely found my new favorite!! I am fair skin and burn super easy. I went swimming (with this applied) for an hour with my husband, and didn‚Äôt even turn pink! It‚Äôs absolutely amazing. I‚Äôm definitely sticking with this forever. üíö

It‚Äôs very thick but goes a long way and works like a charm. I‚Äôm pleased with order and would purchase again. We‚Äôve been using it all summer.

My wife have try all kinds of sunscreen and for some unknown reason she be came allergie to them so that doctor told her to start using organic sunscreen and so far is being really good on her face

It covers well. Don't try to blend it in. Also knead well before use--sometimes you have to remove the cap to get it to come out.

I'm 63 and use this on my face. I like that it's not cakey, you can rub it it and put make up over it. It doesn't smell weird, and nontoxic. I'll buy again.

Works for acne prone, eczema skin! Love the natural ingredients, made in USA ‚Äî Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

I keep a tube of Two Peas in my golf bag. I use it before and during my round. I can reapply anytime and not get greasy hands. I also like the fact it doesn‚Äôt have any smell like other lotions.

Looking for a natural sunscreen. Great and seems to prevent burning. Not very easy to get on clear tho, super thick and have to rub it in a lot and still white spots. I am glad for the ingredient quality

eos-eos

I actually used this product for the high zinc content. It worked great as a salve at night time for my dermatitis I developed around my mouth from wearing face masks during COVID. It is fragrance free which I love. It is thick and I can imagine would work great as a sunscreen.

eos-eos

Nice! I‚Äôve been hoping for a Two Peas 50 spf. The 30 is great for my husband and the older kids, but I like spf 50 for my super fare skin and for the babies. Thank you two peas!!! We love your products!

Love it. Not greasy. Good cover.

The only thing I use on my kids.

Great natural sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin! I have to run it in ALOt to get rid of the white left behind, but other than that I love it! Use it everyday!

Absolutely love this sunscreen. Every sunscreen i use on my son gives him a rash. Not this one !!@

just right you will like it

I really like how smooth this goes on and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or tacky like sunblock. I do wish it was a bit bigger for the price. But I know you pay more when it‚Äôs organic.

Great product I love it because it's organic

Great product!

Love this sunscreen! Not only is it a clean product and safe for our oceans but it keeps me protected on my hikes, runs, beach trips etc. I'm more on the pale side so finding a good sunscreen is really important to me. I mean let's be real, who doesn't want to protect their skin and age gracefully these days? :)

This product is used to prevent sunburn. It has zinc in it that definitely helps with protection from sunburn.

Love this sunscreen. My 13 year old daughter has severe eczema so finding an affordable sunscreen that doesn't cause her to breakout is hard. This stuff is amazing. No strong harsh smells. Not greasy but 7coats the skin easily. Best thing...we've used it so far 3 times WITHOUT any eczema flare ups! I will definitely purchase this again. Thank yall for a great product!

Used for Sunscreen. I knew it was going to be thick, but it's way too hard for me to get out of the tube. The fragrance is nice.

Liked that it was organic. Kids seemed OK with it. Provides good protection at a reasonable price.

This sunscreen is very high quality and a thick consistency allowing me to use less of it to accomplish covering more surface area.

Works great and isn‚Äôt greasy!

I was super excited to use this, as this year I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äòclean up‚Äô my skin care products. After some research this sunscreen came pretty near the top of this list, so I bought it for our Florida trip. I used the sunscreen as directed on a recent beach trip and reapplied during the several hours we were there. As another reviewer said, I felt like this also magnified the sunburn. I don‚Äôt normally burn terribly, but I‚Äôm currently fried and swollen. I have been to this same beach at the same time of year for several years now and never had much problem. For the rest of the trip I resorted back to my old sunscreen and will be doing more research for another clean sunscreen.

eos-eos

It depends what your looking for. It‚Äôs definitely waterproof. I found it difficult to get off even after scrubbing in the shower I still could feel a residue the next day. It is a very thick lotion and hard to rub in. I did not find that it went sheer after rubbing it in aggressively. I still had a white sheen on my skin. But it‚Äôs definitely effective against the suns rays and the ingredients are safe.

eos-eos

I love that the ingredients are all natural! There are no unpronounceable chemicals, it‚Äôs SPF 50, and the sunblock is old school white zinc oxide, like a 1980s lifeguard. But this stuff does not disappear on you, it leaves a very noticeably white film! I called it my ‚Äúphantom of the opera sunblock‚Äù. If a phantom white appearance is not an issue for you, this is absolutely the best! The ingredients are so clean and natural you could possibly eat it (but I don‚Äôt recommend that).

eos-eos

It seemed to protect from the sun well but it didn‚Äôt apply smoothly and took a good bit of rubbing before the white went away.

As mineral-based sunblocks go, this one‚Äôs pretty good. It does the job of saving you from sunburn if applied properly and it wasn‚Äôt too bad to spread it. If you‚Äôre used to mineral-based sunblock Stan there won‚Äôt be any surprises with this one. If you‚Äôre used to really different products with easy spread ability then you‚Äôll have a learning curve. Such is the way with all of this mineral-based products. I did like the size of those container and was happy to know that I was using something that didn‚Äôt have weird chemicals in it
