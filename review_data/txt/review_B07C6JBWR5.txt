I will say its probably not for people who want color and fragrance. It's a no nonsense, safe sunscreen for outdoors activities. I give it extremely high marks. No issues with reactions or burning.  Tldr: I just plant it in my foyer each summer for the whole family. It holds up well is salt water, even surfing. I can usually get 2 or 3 hours of heavy water activity on light application. It spreads out well so it will probably last more than a year. No problems with reactions or burning eyes from kids or adults. We usually rub it in well and let it dry a bit. I haven't tried it on an infant so can't speak to that. It will grease up sunglasses but that's normal. It has a slight smell when you put it on, something like a face cream, but it's not strong and pretty much gone after a few minutes. I bought a $1 travel bottle and fill it up if I need to travel with it. Even a 2.5 oz. Bottle has lasted a week for me with two kids in tow.
