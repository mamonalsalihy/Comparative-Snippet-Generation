I love this product. I bought it for sun protection because I am using a product that has alpha hydroxy acid on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight yet it is very rich. It gives a beautiful sheen to the skin and without a white cast. I am a black women and that is one of the main problems with sunscreen for us. This brand knows how to do it. I have been using their Unseen face sunscreen for several months now and decided to see if they also had one for the body now that I am using the AHA. It was pricey , but you get so much and a little goes a long way. If you do a full pump be prepared to put it in several places before rubbing it in. A lot comes out with a full pump. I will never use anything else.

Buyer beware! This sunscreen is not reef safe. Is contains Avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate and octocrylene which are all harmful to coral reefs. False advertising on web site and packaging. Not reef safe.

The media could not be loaded. I have acne prone, oily combination and sensitive skin, and this was just awful for me. First of all there's this smell of sweet lemon juice which was for me terrible, and I see it contains some citrus ingredients and I don't understand why would you do that. Secondly, it's suuuuuper greasy!! It's so sticky and doesn't absorb AT ALL. I then started using it on my legs and arms to not waste it, but it was super sticky and icky on there too. It attracts so much dirt from the air and environment and it sticks to you and is just awful. About the protection and moisture, I have no idea. About breaking out from it- I don't know, I didn't use it long enough to check and notice it. I used it maybe 2 times since I received it and I hated it. Definitely will never buy again. The texture is light at first, but then when you spread it you can see it covers a lot and is actually really heavy. You can see (I hope) in the video I attached. Also you can see the shine and greasiness at the end and in my picture. On the face of course it is 5 times worse.  What did work for me better: PURITO centella green 50 SPF, and La Roche Posay Anthelios 50+ SPF.

We live in Florida and wear sunscreen every day - no matter what we are doing. This is by far the best sunscreen we have tried! Not greasy at all. I put this on in the morning and have it on all day; it just feels like a regular, nice lotion but with amazing sun protection. My husband and kids love it, too.

eos-eos

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEE!!!! Started laser hair removal and I have to wear sunscreen daily. I picked this up after trusted recommendation from a reliable source. Extremely light weight and very spreadable (less product application). Has a handful of organic products including sunflower oil. Buy over and over again!

eos-eos

Just purchased this again when my son ended up sunburned with a sunscreen spray. We have been using supergoop sunscreen for thee years now- we have a pool so the kids needed it daily. My kids love it, super easy to put on. It doesn't leave white streaks. Has a pleasant smell. The kids have never complained about burning eyes. And as long as we used supergoop, they have never walked away burnt. Not sure if this new version “play”’is any different but I hope not.

I was really hesitant to pay 20+ dollars for sun protection, but I am not going to lie, this sun lotion is really good. I love that it's Black owned business is offered here on Amazon, more and more. Also, the scent is little to none (which I prefer), it's very lightweight, gives me a dewy afterglow without white cast, and actually moisturizes my skin too-- and I have combination skin, so it works for the dry and oily zones of my face. I use it mostly for my face, neck, and hands. The dark spots from my recent breakouts have not gotten any darker, so it's actually really helping to lessen the affects of sun exposure and hyperpigmentation. Would definitely recommend. Worth the pay out.

I bought this to test it out as a sunscreen for riding. I still haven't ridden with it on, but I've used it everyday. One, it goes on super easy. I know when I've finished an area. Next, it smells great. It smells like rosemary rather than sunscreen. Last, it layers well with my moisturizer. Although it does provide a fair amount of moisture on its own, I like to have a little additional moisturization.  I had read good reviews about this product before, and now I believe them. I'll be buying this well into the future.

I purchased this sunscreen a little over a week ago and have really enjoyed using it so far! I was initially torn between this product and the Unseen Sunscreen but decided to give this a try since it seemed more cost-effective (cheaper per ounce), seemed it would function as a good substitute for a moisturizer, and the unseen sunscreen was not in stock at the time. Ultimately, I am very glad with my decision. When I first received my package (I ordered the larger size since the cost per ounce is cheaper than the smaller) I was a little bummed when the bag the sunscreen came in said it was supposed to be 7 ounces instead of 5. Also, when I put it on my face right away it felt kind of greasy, which is a common review it gets online. However, I since have been putting it on in the mornings after I wash my face and have not found it to be greasy at all. I have sensitive, oily acne-prone skin and was worried about how this product would feel/interact with my skin, but have overall been very impressed so far. It has a pleasant scent compared to most sunscreens, does not leave a white tint, and does a good job of moisturizing my oily skin. Would definitely recommend as a good option for a daily sunscreen!

I've bought this for my husband 2 years ago, and definitely recommend it. I use their whole line. Even with these crazy temperatures these last 2 years, he's never sunburned and his skin is beautiful. Does not burn the eyes or drip at all. I've also used it on my grandkids. Worth every penny. If you care about your family's skin, I am telling you, you won't be disappointed! Any of Supergoop products! I use the whole line!

eos-eos

Goes on great and there is no white cast. I am lighter brown skin but the cast of other sunscreens look like a lilac cast in me. You get a bigger bottle and the scent is a little lemony but not too over powering. My skin was very soft but if you have oily skin you might look a little wet.

eos-eos

I hate applying sunscreen, but this stuff is the best I have ever used. I only use it on long bike rides (usually 50-100 miles). I apply it once and I believe I get solid protection. I know I should re-apply, but I'm too sweaty during the ride and have no room to bring more with me. Regardless, it's a good product. A bit over-priced, maybe a lot over-priced. I would buy it as it goes on easily, doesn't have an overpowering scent and performs well when you sweat.

eos-eos

Easy to apply, no greasy and the pump is very convenient. My only minor complaint is that I haven’t been able to secure the pump down so when I travel I wrap the sunscreen in plastic bags to prevent it from leaking. I burn very easily and this product has been a summer essential.

eos-eos

I have tried so many sunscreens for my family (sensitive skin) and the complaints were always that it went on greasy, left a white residue, stung their eyes or had to be applied every hour. This sunscreen doesn't do any of that! It goes on super smooth and clear and is non-greasy. Our whole family used while in Aruba this summer and none of us got sunburned. There is no smell and absolutely no irritation from use. I love it and will only use this product from now on.

I just tried SuperGoop everyday lotion for the first time last week and I am now a loyal consumer. Applies easily and lasts for hours. The lightweight formula does not lay on top of the skin and get caked on. I usually get a little red while at the beach, but not this time. I came home with a glowing tan! Highly recommend!

eos-eos

This sunblock applies very smoothly, is well absorbed and leaves the skin feeling silky and moisturized and not slick or greasy. It also has a fresh, clean lemony scent. I don't mind using it because it makes my skin feel nourished and hydrated and leaves my clothing unstained. Best of all: no white out ghost appearance!  I purchased this after a friend's recommendation and a bit of research on my part and was delighted with the results. I immediately ordered a second tube just to make sure that I never run out of this product.

eos-eos

Great Sunscreen. It disappears on your skin and you don't feel like you have sunscreen on at all. Does not feel greasy and does not make your skin break out. Great Product :)

eos-eos

This is easy to use (love the pump), lightweight yet provides excellent coverage without white residue, has a very light scent (good for men or women), and has a really nice texture. It goes on easily, isn't greasy, and feels nice on. We plan to keep this out on the bathroom counter for easy, daily application without any fuss or sunscreen smell. I highly recommend!

eos-eos

For an everyday sun screen you can't do much better than this stuff. I live in Colorado and the sun gets intense at high altitude. Goop Play is some of the best I've used, with UVA/B protection and a nice scent to go along with it. I put it on after a shower in the morning and it penetrates and holds well all day long. Go with the pump bottle for a better value.

I have been using this sunscreen for over a year now, I live in Southern California and the sun is very strong here, so I wear it pretty much daily. My esthetician noticed a huge difference in my skin right away and I love the smell and texture of this product! I typically wear it over my moisturizer or over BB cream. It is great for the whole body, just remember to reapply! I have very sensitive skin and have had zero issues with this sunscreen, I think it has actually improved my skin barrier and I will continue to purchase it! :D

eos-eos

This sunscreen is my new go-to for longer trips - the large form factor is great for a single person or couple for about a 1-2 week vacation. I recently went to the BVI and was able to make the container last for the entire 1.5 week trip for myself. If you're sharing as a family and plan on reapplying frequently, might want to grab two. The pump is much better than using smaller bottles and easy to pack and bring back since the pump locks for storage. Great product, smells delicious, and good consistency on the skin!

eos-eos

OK. So it's great applied to your face, it even works well under makeup. When applied it gives you a healthy "glow". In order to stay protected, at least where I live in South Florida, you should apply several times a day. Also, I went to the dermatologist and she said I used a great moisturizer,and asked what it was. So, yes it's pricey, but it doesn't get all over your clothing, it does not make you break out, and I buy this over and over again..

eos-eos

At my age, I've tried so many sunscreens it's ridiculous but this one hands down I buy it bulk. It works the best on my brown skin. Some may say it goes on a little sticky but it doesn't bother me because it dissolves into the skin eventually. Keeps me protected and I enjoy putting more on since I stay in the sun. My husband and I agree this is the perfect sunscreen for us with no irritants or break outs.

eos-eos

Great product. I haven’t tested it in the strong sun with no shade but when I used it I got good protection. Lightweight and non sticky!!!! Great light scent too. The main reason I got this product was for the ingredients. Very hard to find good sunscreen that is lightweight, non sticky, smells good and is safe to use while pregnant and breastfeeding. I use this brand for my baby too.

eos-eos

My skin is very sensitive to fragrance. While I know I'll never find a truly scent-free sunscreen, the light fragrance of this one doesn't bother my nose -- or break me out. But the BEST part is that it doesn't linger in my clothes after I wash them. If I'm just going to the beach or running, I'll wear something cheaper because I can live with the perma-stench in bathing suits and gym clothes -- and this is admittedly pricy. But in my opinion, totally worth it!

eos-eos

I have tried a variety of sunscreens but this is the best! I tried the small one to see what I thought and I really liked it. It’s not sticky and it stays on while running which is what I needed it for so it holds up during a sweaty run and walk. I also needed full sun protection. After, using for two weeks, I decided to get the pump which is so much more convenient. It has a light scent. It didn’t bother me.

I’m a redhead… I don’t tan, I burn and then water blister and then peel and then I’m possibly even more pale than before. Sunscreen is my savior and this one I do not have to reapply every time I turn around!! I put this on in the morning before I head out to run errands and I DO NOT BURN…. It is amazing… I will only buy this from now on. I used to use the sprays cuz they’re quick and I smelled of sunscreen all day. THIS DOESNT SMELL LIKE SUNSCREEN. I can be a person again!

I wanted to love this product because I’ve heard lots of good things about it, but alas! I made the mistake of not checking the ingredients list for chemicals that may react poorly with my skin—my own fault, for sure, as I took the “clean, natural ingredients” advertising as gospel. Don’t make my mistake!  This includes avobenzone as an active ingredient, which makes my skin feel like it’s releasing actual hellfire in the form of a painful, burning, sticky rash of irritated skin and teensy-weensy blisters. I regrettably used the sunscreen on my cheeks and neck on a kayaking trip ten days ago—the rest of my body was covered by UPF clothing, thank my fairy godmother—and I’m just today getting my normally smooth skin back, though I am still contending with peeling dryness where the rash was.  If you didn’t read this review in time and had a similar reaction, I’m so sorry. Use minimal products on your skin while it heals; dampen the affected area, slather on petroleum jelly, and stay out of the sun as much as possible until it heals. Normal moisturizers and other sunscreens are not your friend yet.  Whew. Okay, so, yeah—if you have sensitive skin or have had bad reactions to other sunscreens in the past, avoid this one and go for a zinc-based physical sunblock (like a certain Australian brand featuring a colorful amphibian) instead.

I have used Supergoop on and off for years. I put off buying this because of the size. But I am SO glad I bought this. Perfect for countertops. I walk through and use it several times per day. Smells great and not too greasy. I bought one for my mom for Mother’s Day too! We both are very pleased!

Best lotion I have ever used. I have red hair and very fair skin. I DO NOT burn with this product. Smells good, not greasy, goes on evenly.

I love this product. I have tried a lot of sun screens in my love and I love this it keeps you safe and the smell is great and it’s expensive but worth the money to keep your skin safe

This is our favorite again and again. We've tried MANY over the years and keep coming back to Supergoop! Play nee Everyday formula. It feels better on the face than most "face" sunscreens and lotions. It requires very little rub in and leaves no white.

Not white cast (I have olive tone white skin), first product I’ve tried that doesn’t. It doesn’t smell like sunscreen and rubs in SO easily.

This sunscreen is very light on the skin, it absorbs super fast, just like a regular skin lotion. I went to an island with my family, everyone had their own sunscreen, we spent a week there and by the end of the trip it was clear that this product did a great job, no sunburn at all but instead and very (very) light and even tan. The scent is very neutral and leaves no white color or any visible residue on the skin.

I have used Super goop for several summers now. My skin is very fair and burns easily. I haven’t had any problem with burning and my skin looks moisturized and supple. It applies smoothly and I love the scent. I apply it every three hours or so on the golf course or at the beach. I give it two thumbs up!

Mom of 4 boys. Usually buy the great physical non-nano zinc sunscreens which means the boys and hubby dislike applying for the thick white nature. This goes on like lotion and the boys have been much more compliant with it. Many sunscreens these days still allow them to burn even with reapplication frequently and appropriately. This did not. Worked well.

This sunscreen goes on smoothly and works great as a sunscreen. I have never had a sunburn since I started using it. I do reapply every few hours.

I love this formula! Love using on my kids and myself. The formula is very lightweight and easy to rub on skin. It doesn't leave a white layer that sunscreens typically do, and it doesn't make our eyes water👍🏻

Absolutely love this sunscreen. It smells great, is super lightweight to put on, and is sheer. My little guys have dark skin and this lotion goes on smooth and sheer with excellent coverage. It is great for the whole family. This will definitely our go-to sunscreen until further notice.

I went through a bunch of sunscreen purchases that I was very unhappy with. This is my gold standard! No white casts. Absorbs completely and smells nice. Price-wise, it’s a bit more expensive than one from a pharmacy, but it does what I want it to do without fussing with it, so I’m comfortable paying the price for convenience.

I teach water aerobics and wear sunscreen everyday with high spf. I hated the feel of sunscreen for an entire day at work. This is perfect and worth the money. I don’t feel like I’m wearing sunscreen and the smell is very light and pleasant.

We live in the desert and need to put on sunscreen nearly every day. This is very light and has very little scent. I also like the the larger bottle with a pump!

The first complement came from my daughter which is now using it too ... Leaves my face radiant and smooth. It has a great scent too..

I love the smell! I don’t like coconut so the fact that this has a light, lemony/herby smell is great! I got the smaller bottle because I wanted to test before I committed to the big pump bottle, but now I’m annoyed I didn’t just get the big bottle lol. Works great, smells good, reef safe, and the company seems cool. What else do you need?

Every dermatologist will tell you that sunscreen is the best defense against skin cancer and since I’ve had several, I take their advice. This sunscreen is perfect. Great for everyday use, I put this one on when I get ready in the morning, and then reapply with the spray when I go out into the sun. Love this stuff!

Perfect size bottle to take on the boat. Enough for the whole family and should last through most of the summer. Love the pump and the ability to lock the pump when it's not in use. We all love this brand of sunscreen!

It’s perfect for everyday. It’s moisturizing and dries down and absorbs super quick. The light scent isn’t overpowering and it goes perfect under your makeup!

Ya'll I don't think I'll get another brand of sunscreen. I also have the more matte version which I am also obsessed with. I'm breakout prone, never gave me issues as long as I cleanse my skin every evening. Beautiful, beautiful product.

This is super easy to apply and no one is getting burnt in the intense Florida sun but it does have a natural essential oil smell that kind of reminds me of natural bug spray. But it’s not off putting it’s just not that traditional sunscreen scent

This is the best spf 50 broad spectrum sunblock I have used so far. It doesn’t feel overly heavy or greasy. It feels like a moisturizer, and smells pleasantly citrusy. My child and I have sensitive skin, and this didn’t give us a reaction. It doesn’t leave a white cast on your skin like other sunblocks. I like that it is broad spectrum and water resistant.
