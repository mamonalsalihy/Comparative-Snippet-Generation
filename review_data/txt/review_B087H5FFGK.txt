Low oil content. Good for sensitive and oily skin.

This sunscreen goes on super smooth, love the coverage it provides

Effective sun protection… Love the large bottle but the finish is extremely sticky and uncomfortable which makes me not want to use it.

Not recommended as it’s ok for body, but don’t recommend using on the face. This has given me the worst eye sting I have ever had with any sunscreen.

This is super easy to apply and no one is getting burnt in the intense Florida sun but it does have a natural essential oil smell that kind of reminds me of natural bug spray. But it’s not off putting it’s just not that traditional sunscreen scent

I love the smell! I don’t like coconut so the fact that this has a light, lemony/herby smell is great! I got the smaller bottle because I wanted to test before I committed to the big pump bottle, but now I’m annoyed I didn’t just get the big bottle lol. Works great, smells good, reef safe, and the company seems cool. What else do you need?

Only reason for the 4 stars is just because of the price. Good, quality and SAFE sunscreen shouldn't be at a luxury price. Otherwise - we love it! The pump is a great idea, wish more companies would jump on board with that! Kids love the smell and say it "feels good" on their face.

I have used Super goop for several summers now. My skin is very fair and burns easily. I haven’t had any problem with burning and my skin looks moisturized and supple. It applies smoothly and I love the scent. I apply it every three hours or so on the golf course or at the beach. I give it two thumbs up!

I'm a suckered for sunscreen especially in the Caribbean. The beach is my life. This SPF 50 is Goopalicious🤣🤣🤣🤣. Every girl needs to have one and oh it's great for anyone who has tretinoin and Vitamin C in their daily facial routine. Especially skin of colour 😍

My skin is very sensitive to fragrance. While I know I'll never find a truly scent-free sunscreen, the light fragrance of this one doesn't bother my nose -- or break me out. But the BEST part is that it doesn't linger in my clothes after I wash them. If I'm just going to the beach or running, I'll wear something cheaper because I can live with the perma-stench in bathing suits and gym clothes -- and this is admittedly pricy. But in my opinion, totally worth it!
