great product. One of my regular go-to sunscreens.

My dermatologist has recommended this brand to me and I love it. Great sun protection, lasts a long time, but a little on the pricier side. Willing to go for better protection at a slightly higher price.

This stuff is fantastic. For American sunscreen, this is definitely the way to go. Reef safe is a huge bonus! It dries clear and absorbs super fast without ever sweating off, even if you go into the water. I do triathlons and this stuff has been with me every step of the way.

My favorite sunscreen. Smells good, keeps me from getting sunburnt. Doesn’t leave me all oily or sticky feeling. Have to reapply frequently if in the water or sweating, but that’s all sunscreens.

We use a lot of sunscreen so I signed up for the auto ship and really saved compared to the store price!! This is a good sunscreen too!

I love sun bum everything and I regularly buy this brand from drugstores and boutiques. I decided to try on Amazon and unfortunately two of the three bottles only sprayed for a short one use before not being able to spray anymore.

This product is banned in the USVI for containing ingredients that are harmful to coral reefs.  For truly reef friendly products, look for zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide on the active ingredients. Amazon sells several good options like ThinkSport, Reef Repair, or Badger.

Contains Octocrylene which is a proven coral killer and also avobenzone and octisalate which are toxic to other sealife. There are over 260 sunscreens which actually are reef safe, many available here at Amazon. Please, if you bring this product to where there is coral, do not swim with it on.
