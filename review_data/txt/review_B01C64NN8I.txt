My dermatologist has recommended this brand to me and I love it. Great sun protection, lasts a long time, but a little on the pricier side. Willing to go for better protection at a slightly higher price.

I really like this sunscreen--I spend most summer weekends on the beach,and being able to self-apply is great. My experience has been that the Sun Bum spray is more water resistant, which is critical, as I am in and out of the water all day between volleyball games.  It also smells great! Very tropical, lots of coconut.

Is it possible to have a great sunscreen experience? Because if it is, I just had one. I used this sunscreen and the Sun Bum 30 SPF face stick for a nine-day visit to Maui. I was in the sun and surf constantly. Not a single incident of sun burn. Literally, not one. The face stick is one of the most convenient things I've ever used on a sun trip. I have a new favorite sunscreen.

I LOVE Sun Bum products with the exception of the zinx oxide products), BUT it is a little on the expensive side. I use the 50 spf, while the rest of the family uses 30 spf. It either smells like coconut some days, and banana laffy taffy other days. It is a pleasant coconut that reminds you of summer's on the beach.

We use a lot of sunscreen so I signed up for the auto ship and really saved compared to the store price!! This is a good sunscreen too!

Love this brand and this sunscreen! It's environmentally friendly, contains no oils, is gluten free, and they don't test on animals! This is my go-to for normal use, like going to the pool or beach for a few hours. They have stronger products if I plan on a long day on the water, but this normally suits my needs otherwise. It sprays evenly and smells amazing! I recommend this brand to all of my friends, as their whole line it awesome.

great product. One of my regular go-to sunscreens.

This is my family’s number 1 sunscreen. First learned about it from cousins who live in the Caribbean two years ago and we haven’t stopped using it since. Goes on quickly and evenly, not greasy and the scent isn’t overwhelmingly strong. We live in South Florida and always keep this brand in our beach bags and on the boat!

This stuff is fantastic. For American sunscreen, this is definitely the way to go. Reef safe is a huge bonus! It dries clear and absorbs super fast without ever sweating off, even if you go into the water. I do triathlons and this stuff has been with me every step of the way.

This sunscreen works great. The best part tho is the slightly coconut scent that makes any time you use it feel like being in paradise.

Love this product! It works great. No burns since using it. Smells amazing. I use the 50 on my kids and love that one too. Great product.

Our new favorite!!! It sprays so nicely and evenly. And the smell is amazing! It’s nice that it’s more natural than a lot of other sunscreens.

Love this stuff

Great sunscreen and smells good too. Doesn’t leave greasy film after drying and applies easily. Only complaint is that it seems to be used up quickly.

I love sun bum everything and I regularly buy this brand from drugstores and boutiques. I decided to try on Amazon and unfortunately two of the three bottles only sprayed for a short one use before not being able to spray anymore.

I love sun bum sunscreen. My daughter and I use the cream and the face sticks. This spray applies well, but my daughter and I seem to have a sensitivity to all sunblock sprays (we tried others with the same affect and decided to try this one b/c the cream version works wonderfully and we wanted to see if the spray could do the same). Nothing against this product, again the application works really well but we can't use it more than a couple of days in a row before our skin gets irritated.

eos-eos

Ordered 3 bottles, the 3rd one does not spray at all- complete dud. Realized it after the return window closed. Very frustrating

eos-eos

Have been a loyal Sun Bum customer for a long time; received three cans for a trip to the islands, two out of the three wouldn’t spray at all. Waste of money.

eos-eos

Way over priced; can find these cheaper many other places if you look and try.

eos-eos

We love this product and usually buy it from our local pool store. However, we ordered the 3 pack from Amazon and it didn’t show when it was supposed to. We were leaving the following day for vacation. When we got back and tried to use them, 2 of the 3 bottles only trickles when trying to spray. I’m very disappointed, and like I said this is our favorite sunscreen.

For some reason, I used it in my daughter and her skin turned orange. it wiped off as if she had a spray tan! I love Sun Bum and I'm so disappointed!

eos-eos

Listen, I know they don't say they're natural or mineral...but this: Avobenzone 3.00%, Homosalate 5.00%, Octisalate 3.00%, Octocrylene 2.75%, Oxybenzone 4.00%. , behenyl alcohol, bht, butyloctyl salicylate, caprylyl methicone, dimethicone, dimethyl capramide, disodium edta, ethylhexyl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, glyceryl stearate, methylisothiazolinone, peg-100 stearate, polyaminopropyl biguanide, polyester-8, silica, sodium polyacrylate, styrene/acrylates copolymer, tocopheryl acetate, trideceth-6, trimethyl siloxysilicate, vp/hexadecene copolyme. ......is a disgusting travesty.  Upon further research we learned most of the ingredients are chemicals that are NOT good for humans. We are human, it was a bad mix. The two people who used it had a red face, arms, back...they needed to wash it off & then a cold compress was necessary and one person actually used a cortisone cream...it was that painful.  Do not use this!!!!!

I love sun bum. It smells amazing, and it protects you from the sun pretty well. With that’s said, I made the mistake today of using this while kayaking. It turns out that deer flies also LOVE this scent, even though I used bug spray. I highly regret using this sunscreen while on the river just because of how many flies it was attracting. I know it was the sunscreen because my boyfriend and I used this, and we were the only ones in our group of 4 getting bitten.

This product is banned in the USVI for containing ingredients that are harmful to coral reefs.  For truly reef friendly products, look for zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide on the active ingredients. Amazon sells several good options like ThinkSport, Reef Repair, or Badger.

eos-eos

Contains Octocrylene which is a proven coral killer and also avobenzone and octisalate which are toxic to other sealife. There are over 260 sunscreens which actually are reef safe, many available here at Amazon. Please, if you bring this product to where there is coral, do not swim with it on.

My favorite sunscreen. Smells good, keeps me from getting sunburnt. Doesn’t leave me all oily or sticky feeling. Have to reapply frequently if in the water or sweating, but that’s all sunscreens.

Smells great and very easy to apply.

This is one of the only sunscreens I will use for myself and my kids! It smells amazing and isn’t greasy!
