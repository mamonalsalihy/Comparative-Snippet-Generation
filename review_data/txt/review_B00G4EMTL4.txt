The ONLY sunblock I will ever buy!! This is the best sunblock. My husband and I went on a cruise and took this sunblock and also the neutropenia sport lotion sunblock. My husband applied the lotion all over the front of him and I use this spray to do his back, neck, love handles, and even down the backs of his legs. After a day in the sun he was burnt on the front of his body and NOT burnt where I applied the spray. Since that day we both swear by this sunblock. Proven to work!!!

I was impressed with the amount of product that was in a compact container. Easy for travel

So much time has been saved this summer with this wet skin spray sunscreen. We have been more compliant with reapplication this summer because we don’t have to dry off first. Thank you!

Good stuff

Great lotion that gives excellent protection for sensitive skin!

Great if you have zero sun tolerance. The ability to spray on wet skin is not as important to me as the ability to work after I'm in the water.

Wonderful for adults and children.

I like this product in that you can protect your scalp as well as exposed skin from the sun. Easy spray on seems to protect well

Easy to apply and does not leave you feeling all sticky.

Love this sunscreen.

Easy for beach, or for a quick reapply

Love it!

Goes on easy, works well, so far no staining.

for the price and the amount per bottle, i get like 5 full spray downs per bottle. I dont apply lightly either. Its good for the sun and sticks well.

Perfect for the beach

Received VERY QUICKLY!

Living in Florida where the sun shines most days...this sunscreen does the trick. It’s easy to apply and last for a while. Follow the instructions for coverage and conditions and this will be all you need anywhere

No expiration date on bottles and no way to return items.

Works great! Bought this for a vacation in Mexico. I've previously had sunscreens come off in water and I burn easily. This one is very oily on your skin and doesn't absorb so it's kinda icky, but lasts for a really long time! I didn't burn at all and I did a lot of swimming and snorkeling. I won't use this as an everyday sunscreen but it's definitely staying stocked in my cabinet. I'm going to use it for all swimming situations and possibly really sweaty sports too.

I really liked using this product! It seemed to work well in the constant sun we had. I’m fair skinned & that’s important to me!

This was our go-to product for a Mexican beach vacation. It feels wonderful on the skin. It provided coverage despite going into the ocean or swimming pools. I only had to reapply a couple of times over the course of a day. I didn't have a single spot that got over exposed. We will definitely use this again.

The absolute best option for sunscreen. Works like a charm every single time, even when I'm at my sweatiest. I highly recommend it.

Best spray sunscreen I’ve ever used. SMELLS LIKE A PLEASANT BODY WASH.

Unfortunately arrived expired. Per dermatologists, the expiration date is an important factor in the effectiveness of SPF. Extremely disappointed ☹️

My favorite sunscreen of all time! Doesn't leave your skin greasy and with a weird smell like other sun screens. Offers wonderful sun protection. My kids are covered all day. Wonderful coverage even while playing in the water!

My hubby burns easily and usually takes forever to slather on thick sun block creams!!! Not any more!!! Works extremely well, yet light and non-greasy!! Great product works well on our 6 yr old too!!

This is a fantastic product

Used this in Cura Cao with great results. Put it on, went snorkeling, walked the beach and just hung out with no sun burn. Perfect!

I love this brand for my kids

Little alcohol and chemical smell when first spraying. Seems effective but does need to be reapplied frequently.

eos-eos

I love this spf. Ez to apply. Lasts. Not greasy.

eos-eos

The product does its job.

eos-eos

Does what it's supposed to do, I assume. If it didn't smell like I had just eaten pancakes for breakfast after I put it on, it would be perfect. But the smell is just so offensive to me that I will not be repurchasing.

Love this stuff. Our family has very fair skin and burns easily. This goes on so smooth, my teenagers grab it and apply w/out being nagged. The three pack is a great deal on price as well.

eos-eos

I work outdoors and it protects me well. Would recommend to anyone who needs extra protection.

eos-eos

Worked great on the beach and in the pool for multiple hours. Very impeessed!

eos-eos

Exactly as ordered and with a 2018 expiration date!

eos-eos

peels a little if you do a second layer of it, but looks great, protects well and smells good

eos-eos

Like any spray, once it's about half gone, it gets hard to use.

eos-eos

I mean it works and dries quick, but it smells so bad, so so bad. I’ll never buy it again. Very disappointed

I usually like this brand.This product doesn't seem as protective as it has been in the past.

I like this product.

I used this on my four year old daughter today on vacation. I applied before going out in the sun and then reapplied multiple times. Around lunchtime, I could tell she was getting red so I made her change her bathing suit into a long sleeve with SPF. Tonight she is very red. I am disappointed in this product. I sent my husband to the store to purchase a different brand and kind that you rub in.

Difficult to press spray if you have weak fingers . Hard to spray on back

It was not a pack of three. It was one.

We just spent about two weeks overseas near the Tropic of Cancer in lattitude- me for work, the family for play. I only brought this one can of Neutrogena Wet Skin Sunblock for the body, and another brand for our faces. I can confidently say that no one got burned, and really, only moderately tanned, even though the kids spent hours in the water and sun. The spray was extremely easy to apply, with a twisting action on the cap for opening and closing the wide pressing (nozzle) area, and gently depressing for a smooth and even coat. The spray feels like a light oil, and blends quickly into the skin. Most importantly, it seems very effective, and I didn't need to reapply on the kids' legs and arms after the first coat, which lasted during the 4-5 hours they were playing in the sun and water at a time. This was far simpler to use than the lotion or cream type sunblocks we have, and we still have left over product in the can after the trip. I highly recommend.

Up until now, I have been using Banana Boat SPF 30 spray. I have been quite satisfied with that product. Looking at the active ingredients listed on the Neutrogena SPF 50 spray, I can see that they are the same as those listed for the Banana Boat with the exception that the Neutrogena ingredients are in higher percentages. The inactive ingredients are also similar.  To test the Neutrogena's water resistance, I sprayed some on the back of one hand before taking a shower. Afterward, it looked like there was still some left on the Neutrogena hand.  I expected the Neutrogena to work well, but to test it, I took it with me for a week of skiing. The sun is more intense because of the altitude and additionally because of reflections off the snow. I applied the spray by spraying on my hand and then rubbing it onto my face in the morning. My nose is slightly pink after one week of this, but I have not been burned. It really works.

My wife and I visit the Island of Bonaire about once a quarter. Bonaire is the lesser known sibling of the better known Island of Aruba. Bonaire has a number of wonderful features, but the main attraction is the water. Diving on Bonaire is some of the best in the world, as is the wind surfing.  Both my wife and I are fair skinned, so we use sun block constantly when we are visiting Bonaire. We used the Neutrogena sunblock in the yellow container. Both the Neutrogena sunblock products are great, but we like the "wet skin" sunblock better for the water. The sunblock stands up better after snorking or diving. The sunblock also has a pleasant scent. Like the yellow package sunblock, the spray is great for me since it gets through the hair on my arms and legs. After using this sunblock we're going to buy this in the future, rather than the yellow package sunblock.

I'm 45 and have been using sunscreens for most of those years. I've lived in Hawaii and now live in South Florida. The sun is an issue. So, sunscreen is a must, especially when at the pool or beach.  Neutrogena Wet Skin Sunblock Spray wonderful. It's much easier to apply than the old style lotions. You don't even have to use your hands, though I recommend rubbing it in for maximum coverage. It is best to apply and let dry before going out in the sun, but as a spray, it is easy to re-apply when at the beach or pool. Even at SPF 50, I noticed that I got some color after 3 hours in the sun, but my skin didn't burn. Itchy then peeling skin is the worst! Neutrogena Wet Skin Sunblock Spray save you from that if used properly.  ~ Kort

My granddaughter loves to play in the water in the back yard on warm days and is outdoors for a good portion of the day even while at her preschool. Her usual sunscreen wears off too quickly. This Neutrogena lotion is easy to apply and long lasting and has a pleasant scent. I don't spray it on her face though - just spray into my hand and wipe carefully onto her face avoiding her eyes. I now keep one in my travel kit as well, so that when we're travelling to hot, humid places we have a sunscreen that stays on and doesn't slide off as soon as we start sweating.
