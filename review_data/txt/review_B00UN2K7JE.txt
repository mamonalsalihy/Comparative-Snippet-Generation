Don’t waste your money, product is great but won’t spray and it’s not eligible for return.

Horrible spray bottle. The whole spray cap is nonfunctional.

Incredibly hard to spray, maybe I just got one with a bad nozzle. Also doesnt advertise having Fragrance(Parfum) but its listed on the bottle.

I love this product but I will no longer buy it from Amazon. The product Is defective and won’t spray rendering it useless. But then I am not allowed to return/replaced it? It’s too expensive to not be able to replace it. I’ll continue to buy this product but not from Amazon.

I used this one time and now it won't spray and it is not returnable. Complete waste of money and without Sunscreen at the pool on a 95 degree day.

I am pretty frustrated, bc I have bought this in the past, from Amazon, & while it is a good product, I got a defective can in my most recent order, and it cannot be returned. Really disappointed with the service from Amazon on this item. It is costly, and can’t be used.

I can’t comment much on the product as it’s incredibly hard to get the spray to work. The whole family tried and disappointed. I Am Not sure if it’s just the 1 bottle that we received or not we haven’t been able to use it because of the issue.

Very disappointed and frustrated. I was excited to try it because my son is allergic to coconut so it's hard to find sunscreen for him. The sprayer doesn't work. It's unlocked, but I have to use both hands to get a little out and that only works half the time.
