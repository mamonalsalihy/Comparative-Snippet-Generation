This product is amazing and is the first sunscreen product I’ve found to not cause my rosacea skin to break out. However - something is seriously wrong with the last two bottles I have received from amazon. I saw a couple of other similar reviews. The consistency is all wrong (been using this product for several years so I can tell) AND the worst part of all is it smells strange! The replacement bottle wasn’t quite as bad smelling as the first which was unbearable but still bad enough that I want to return. Smells musty/plasticy/old if I had to try to name the smell. Consistency is kinda runny and the tint/lotion seems runny and separated. Seems to still be protecting me from UV but putting it on is probably one of the more unpleasant parts of my day. Bummed because I’d rather use amazon - but not with these issues. Prob order from Dermstore instead.

My Derm says that I am a FitzPatrick skin type 5. I am similar in complexion to Michelle Obama.  The tinted sunscreen initially appears too light for my skin, but it blends in well after I apply it.  The untinted Elta MD made my skin appear lighter than it is. The tinted one retains my naturally brown complexion.

I don’t know if it’s Amazon or the manufacturer, but I ordered 2 bottles at different times and the color was different. Texture is the same. See my picture. The lighter color is just like the original bottle I purchased from my dermatologist. The darker one, that came recently, is way too dark for me -I’m a pale redhead. I guess I need to pay the higher price at the derm’s office to be assured of an authentic product.

I'll start by saying I don't invest often in beauty or skin products. I wear minimal makeup and use basic soaps and creams. Still, this product has me singing praises. I'm in my late 30s and in the last year developed rosacea. My skin would be not only red but would itch and burn and nothing would soothe it. I used everything. My dermatologist gave me a prescription for some topical gel and told me to try this. I did the gel first alone. It definitely helped, but it didn't relieve it completely. When I added this, my life changed. My face changed. It puts out the fire on my face instantly. And if I go even one day without it, I know it. The tint is an added bonus- it gives the skin a nice even tone without the cakey makeup look. The SPF is perfect as well- I wore only this all summer and never got a sunburn. I'll never use anything else.

My dermatologist recommended this and I couldn't love it any more!!! It has a little bit of tint that provides just the smallest amount of coverage to even out my skin tone and problem areas. It blends in so easily, I can haphazardly throw it on without worrying about streaks. This is the only thing I've been wearing most days in terms of makeup. It's honestly my new favorite product just because it makes my life easier.

My husband and I are both survivors of Melanoma and other skin cancers. We use this EltaMD UV every morning.

I cannot say enough good things about the EltaMD products. I am very fair, burn easily, and my skin frequently gets inflamed when I apply any sunscreens (including those made specifically for the face). EltaMD absorbs quickly and it's easy to apply make-up over it. I use the tinted version just for that extra bit of coverage b/c I use a very sheer BB-cream as my "foundation", so the tint in the EltaMD adds just the tiniest extra bit of coverage. They also offer a clear - and that works just as well in terms of sunblock. The EltaMD sunblock does NOT contain avobenzone which I have found always makes me break-out (even when the product indicates it does not cause break-outs). This sunblock is so light and feels so good that when I first tried it, I was convinced it couldn't actually work that well, and so I questioned my dermatologist about it and she confirmed it's a great product. After using it long-term, I'm a fan and even though I can only get it online, I plan ahead so I never run out. I wear it daily - sometimes alone, sometimes under my BB cream foundation or mineral powder.

Ok so here’s the deal... I LOVE LOVE this product, I’ve used it for about a year everyday! I first purchased it from my dermatologist and it was great but this bottle from Amazon was disappointing.. this last bottle I ordered doesn’t seem to be the same formula. It has a strong fake smell that reminds me of the fake MAC makeup we used to buy from discount shopping stores. Normally this product has no smell, perfect for a light coverage to run out the door, moisturizing and has an spf! The bottle does look normal, I don’t see anything different there. I’m also questioning the shade, it looks white when I rub it into my face and I can’t tell if it’s turning tinted or not. This is my holy grail product so I know what to expect out of it and this bottle just wasn’t it.. I think I will stick to ordering from my doctors office to be safe. I think I’m going to call the company to check it out.

I’ve worked in derm for a handful of years. I use this product in place of foundation, my skin feels smooth without clogging my pores. I also have skin sensitivities. The logo with the skin cancer foundation assure me that my product is legit/real. Elta does have a location in Texas. Everything on this product is real and the same from a dermatologist store/clinic. Packaging was intact, shipping/arrival was a day late. The size is about as pen. I use this product probably 6 out of 7 days a week. The bottle normally lasts me 5 months or so. You don’t need much. The texture is the same as other sunscreens (I also use blue lizard). Buy the product, Don’t be “afraid” to use it based on the negative reviews. This product is what dermatologist recommend, especially in their aesthetics department. Good for after aesthetic treatments too.

This was recommended by my dermatologist after being on Accutane. I had very oily skin and now it is about normal. This does not make your skin oily whatsoever and the tint works on many skin tones and blends with your skin and doesn't cover it. I can still use my mineral powder over this and get the color I want. My skin lookes even and toned while I wear this and I feel comfortable running out with this just on. My skin feels super soft afterwards for nearly the whole day. It also improves skin and blocks UV rays well. I tend to burn now easier since Accutane and I haven't when using this on my face and neck, while I didn't apply sunblock in other areas where I burned the same day.

eos-eos

Currently my favorite sunscreen product, here are some pros and somethings it could improve on. Pros: 1). Safe around the eyes 2). Great coverage, blocks UV A and UV B 4). If you're a lighter person its easy to find your tint if you mix the SPF 40 untinted version with this 5). Good even coverage on pores makes them far less noticeable, (I have very deep pores especially on my nose and this covers them well) 6). Great for Sensitive skin Cons: 1). If you use CerVe Moisturizing cream before applying this sunscreen the two won't mix, although if you apply CerVe Moisturizing Cream the night before and let dry onto your face it will work perfectly. 2). A moderate shine from using this sunscreen, if you lightly rub in a second time after letting set, this shine nearly vanishes. 3). Doesn't look good in eye wrinkles 4). Leaves a somewhat tinted noticeable cast, (as in you can see the particles of the sunscreen on your face, like a dusty look, if not blended in correctly) 5). Whiteheads aren't hidden very well by this product

Do you feel compelled to use every bit of product before throwing the container in the trash can? Sometimes there’s so much left! After using this Elta sunscreen for years, I finally got around to prying the top off my last container to find it wasn’t necessary. There wasn’t enough left for even one application. Very satisfying to know that I’ve thrown away containers having used the last bit of product.

I just began using this product, but so far I love it. I use fairly high strength prescription retinol cream at night and was looking looking for something moisturizing that wouldn’t “pill” if used along with other products. This has performed wonderfully. When worn alone, it sinks right into the skin- basically disappearing, yet giving just enough of a smoothing effect to make me feel comfortable to go out barefaced. It doesn’t get all “mucked up” in your brows or hairline either, it’s great. During the week if I choose to layer a bit of foundation on top for more coverage, no issues. I’ve paired it with my other serums and potions and it’s fantastic. I have medium tone skin with a lot of red undertones. I would highly recommend. I’ve tried a lot of different sunscreens, priced high to low, this is by far my favorite to date. It doesn’t have that “sunscreen smell/feel” when you apply. It really just feels like you are applying a nice moisturizer. I think when you enjoy applying a product, you’re more apt to use it regularly. But maybe that’s just me....

Love this product. I do not love this product from Amazon! The color was way too orange and burned my face and neck. I would buy elsewhere.

I have used Elta products since my old Manhattan derm recommended them to me. She was THE BEST in Manhattan. Very very rarely will I listen to what anyone has to say about skin products or anti-aging, but this woman was a genius and not a money grubber without ethics-so I did whatever she said about my skin. I am 58 and look under 40-not my opinion, what people say to me-including total strangers who stop me in stores and compliment my skin. I HAVE taken great care of it since age 13-and was a pro makeup artist, so know a lot about it. I have used every sunscreen and tint known to man and this one is the best. I am a medium very warmed toned Caucasian, and it just looks like beautiful skin but protects from sun damage (and if you use it religiously-sunscreen will help your skin actually reverse some sun damage). This does not cause ashy looking skin which is not attractive on anyone. I do think Elta needs to make this in darker tints. It could work on lighter dark toned skin that has cooler undertones-because of the minerals in these tints, it is challenging for a company to make them deep, dark, glowing-and not ashy (greyish). Darker ladies who want to try this could try a two part system: EltaMD first followed by a non sunscreen liquid bronzer to bring warmth back to the skin. That should do the trick to protect and even skin from damage, spots and wrinkling but keep the pretty deep warm glow. Hope my review helps. (Best thing about Amazon-if it doesn’t work you can return it easily)

I've been a longtime user of EltaMd, and while I still love it, the past three or four bottles have a product design flaw so bad I'm now moving on to another product. The bottle shown has a square pump to deliver the sunscreen, but the new design is this rounded head where the sunscreen sputters and it's a constant battle to get out. I'm wasting nearly half the bottle of each because it's so frustrating, and even when you do get it out, it's sputtering all over your hand and probably took three minutes. I'll return as a customer when they revert to the old design, and send me a few bottles to make up for all that wasted product. What a shame!

eos-eos

Between using this and some stuff my dermatologist gave me, my skin went from painfully (both emotionally and physically) broken out to almost 100% clear in ONE WEEK. The tint was slightly alarming when I first used it, since its like a medium tint and I'm roughly the shade of one tablespoon of coffee mixed into an entire cup of milk, but once its rubbed in it just kinda gives my skin a slighly warm glow that looks pretty natural. I'm kinda hoping my current moisturizer runs out soon so I can just start using Elat MD for that as well.

eos-eos

I have sensitive skin and I break easily. I can't use most the sunscreens on the market. I used Sun Bum mineral sunscreen for a longtime but I think they changed the formula so I can't use it anymore. So I switched to dermatologica which is a great product but it leaves you with a white shadow. A friend let me try some of her EltaMD tinted sunscreen which her dermatologist has recommended. I tried it for few days to make sure I don't develop a bad reaction before I bought it myself. As of this review, I finished two EltaMD containers. the EltaMD is fantastic and I can't say enough good things about it. It's light weight so it doesn't clog your pores even after multiple consecutive applications, glides smoothly, it's light tinted so it blends into your skin and no-one knows you have sunscreen on. It definitely works, I'm sensitive to the sun so I can't be in the sun without sunscreen and so far I haven't had any problems being out in the sun for hours while I have EltaMd on. However, I do apply a new coat every 2 hrs religiously. It's very moisturizing. After hot yoga, I wash my fact at the studio and I just apply EltaMD tinted sunscreen without face cream. My face is perfectly fine the whole day and I don't even notice that I didn't apply my fact cream under the EltaMD sunscreen. I'm hooked!

This tinted sunscreen is my only make up. I use it every day and love it. I use a serum and eye cream first but this is my defense. It goes on light and is a bit wet at first but soaks in beautifully and feels great throughout the day. Highly recommend.

eos-eos

On days with intense sun,, I like to layer this sunscreen over mineral sunscreens that leave a white cast. It works like magic to make the white cast disappear. It is also great alone as it just seems to disappear so the color matching is a non issue, yet it seems to even out skin tone. I am a fan of this brand anyway as it is the one my dermatologist recommends, but this was the first time I tried the tinted version.  Like all sunscreens it can be a little oily (but doesn't cause breakouts), but you can layer a little mineral powder sunscreen over any shine or use blotting tissue for a more matt finish.

eos-eos

My doctor recommended this for me and I really like it. I like the lightness vs. putting on some of the heavier body sunscreens. This is slightly tinted but it doesn’t cover flaws like makeup. I sometime combine this with Stay Perfect No 7 in a darker shade to create a golden tone on my face. This is always my foundation before other makeup. Very good protection.

eos-eos

This is TOO DARK and orangy. I'm not white but light brown (some could say I'm white but I don't think so) anyway my color is light. This is just too dark, looks like a bad tan on my face lol everything else is "perfect" but the color is the main problem and unfortunately I won't repurchase. My husband even notice how weird this looks on me. I need to put makeup , with my regular foundation on top so it "hides" the real color underneath. But it can be tiring to be putting makeup on everyday 😩 if I use this by itself it would look so bad, I wish they had different color options

Summer season is here and you definitely need your staple tinted moisturizer. ( Me: freckles, light/warm skin tone, combination skin and red hair. ) - does not irritate my problem skin areas (esp around my chin from having to wear masks) - evens out skin tone - lightweight and no sticky feeling - skin feels like it can still breathe - my new staple every day moisturizer - absolutely LOVE the how the tint gives my face an overall natural healthy color.

I am vain and love the natural beauty look. The best way to keep your skin young and fresh looking is UV brand band protection.....Love this stuff. It was recommended by my medispa practitioner. Lightly tinted never streaks and moisturizes subtly. Ive tried the non tinted and it leaves a white film and does not go on as nicely. Go for the tinted one. Worth the money, and no, Im not getting any kickbacks for saying that. (Im sure there are other ones out there that are like 100$ an oz. but thats not in my budget Its the best daily SPF, Ive ever used. I am on my 3rd bottle in 6 months. The only downside is that it is impossible to tell when the bottle will be empty so I stock up when its on sale so I have it on hand.

eos-eos

Sunscreen and moisturizer. I put it on daily in the morning after washing my face for uv protection. I am generous with applying and this pump container lasts me for almost 3 months. I have bought it for 2 years and I am happy with this product. Comes in tinted and clear. I like and buy the tinted. There are more expensive sun protectors but this is effective sunscreen.

eos-eos

I am a SPF junkie. I make sure to apply my SPF every morning no matter what. It seem's like most of the tinted SPF face products that I have tried here recently are matte of make my face look dry. I needed a hydrating SPF for my face. This does not lie when it says it's hydrating. I have pretty dry skin during the winter and this has saved my face. It goes on so smoothly and just adds a silky finish to my face. It looks hydrated but not oily. I love this stuff. If you are oily at all though, I do not recommend this.

I had been using various supposedly all natural and really renowned moisturizers for my face when my dermatologist said, "you are spending way too much on products that are inferior to this." I pursued buying some that same day and ever since it is one of my daily moisturizers for my face. I don't like to wear a lot of make up, so this provides nice protection with just a little coverage for any places on my face that are out of sorts. It is lightweight and I love how my skin feels with it. I really don't use any other foundation at this point in time.

eos-eos

I've been using this for some time and I love it. It provides super light foundation coverage and you can barely see it. I love the light coverage. I always wear sunscreen so it is a huge plus that it is in the product which I wear every single day. My 23 year old daughter tried it and liked it so much she has now started using it. It may seem a little pricey but it is worth it.

eos-eos

This moisturizer feels lightweight and blends easily. It’s not greasy or cakey and feels very moisturizing. I sometimes use a different one if I want more coverage but this still offers a kind of diffusing effect which is great for my daily use. I have rosacea that flares every now and then and this hasn’t bothered it or caused any breakouts.

eos-eos

I absolutely adore EltaMD daily sunscreen and moisturizer. I have tried many many products and I will not go back to any after using EltaMD.  My skin is very sensitive to new products and will often breakout and take a long time to adapt (and sometimes never). I had no problems with this product. It is clearly moisturizing, which is great. But I also have the one for acne-prone skin and when my skin is too greasy or breaking out, then I switch over to that one until my skin clears. The acne version is definitely not moisturizing and I would not recommend unless you have a breakout because it will dry up your skin. I.e., it does what it is supposed to too!  I have used both the tinted and the non-tinted version. I prefer the tinted because it adds just a subtle tint that improves evenness of my skin tone.

eos-eos

My daughter who is a cosmetologist and hair dresser gave me a bottle for my birthday and recommended it to me. I was shocked to see that my skin looked better at the end of the day! I use very high quality skin care products and they have never given me that kind of result that fast. And I started using it when I wasn't working so just used it after toning, no additional facial CC creams etc. I ordered another bottle when it seemed I was running low on her gift. Won't use anything else from now on for my weekends.

eos-eos

Love this. I took to my dermatologist too to ask what she thought and she confirmed it’s a good product and my skin won’t break out and she was right. (I have normal skin but in the past did suffer from acne). I love how lightweight it feels and how moisturized my skin feels and how the tint disappears into my skin. I use every morning on my face (at night I use bare minerals soft moisturizer). I usually don’t wear any makeup so haven’t Tried it under make up yet.

eos-eos

I really like this product. It goes on easily and doesn't make my face feel tacky or dry. It adds a bit of dewyness. A little goes a long way. The tint is a great match for my skin tone. I do not notice it coming off onto my clothing. Provides great sun protection.

I love this stuff! Been using it for years! My skin is very sensitive and prone to acne. The zinc oxide helps control that and is great for my rosacea. I used to work for a doctor that sold this product which is when I got hooked. I like the tinted even in the winter when I’m pretty pale, it doesn’t streak or ever look orange. I used this product as part of my beauty routine daily to protect my skin and since using it, I’ve been had sunburn in my face, neck or décolleté.

I don’t need anything else in the morning. I use this product, add a little blush, and I am out the door. At first I thought it was expensive, but a little goes a long way. It is sunscreen, moisturizer, and a little tint all in one. It is enough tint to even out my skin tone and it looks like no make up at all. It was also recommended by my dermatologist as a sunscreen.

eos-eos

It is mixed with light color to avoid that white zinc face. It leaves your skin looking dewy and a bit shiny but blends very nicely. I finish with powder which helps to set it. The creamy formula doesn't make my skin sweat and feels very nice. It does not sweat off and I love it for hikes.

I have been using this sunscreen for the last 3 years and I love it. I use the tinted one because I usually do not put much makeup so it helps to cover a little bit. It is light, not greasy, and has anti aging components plus it protects my skin from the sun which I am very sensitive. I usually buy online from Walmart because the price is better but I found this time a good deal at Amazon so I am happy with it. The only complain is that it is very hard to say when I need a new one because I cannot see how much is left in the container.

eos-eos

This product has been part of my daily routine for a year now. I love it. Can’t wear my makeup without it. I also will sometimes use just this and finishing powder for lighter coverage. Not sweat proof and sweats off easily. I have not tried the waterproof version yet. I will order that one for this summer tho for sure.

I love this stuff! I have great skin but it tends to be a little red but this covers the redness perfectly without being the least bit orange. It leaves the skin dewy so if you like a matte finish you might not like it

What I love, price is reasonable, goes on so smoothly and blends instantly. Adds a slight shimmer youthful appearance to your skin. The only thing I don’t like is trying to quickly wash it off my hands and then drying them on white towels. It stains. My issue- I need to wash my hands properly.

This is my go to tinted sunscreen moisturizer. My mom is an esthetician and she recommended it to me. I’ve been using it for atleast a couple years now. It doesn’t dry my super sensitive skin out like others and it spreads super easy so I can even apply while driving without worry. It puts enough color on that my friend noticed a youthful glow and had to get her own!

My dermatologist suggested getting this brand of tinted facial sunscreen. I discovered that it was cheaper to get it through Amazon than through Wal-Mart. However, besides that point, I love how it goes on, the feel, and the coverage. I often just use that by itself instead of putting on a foundation over it. I come from a fair-haired family line that has had some skin cancer that was treatable, however, my gramps was not so lucky. Back in his day, he worked long summer hours in the sun without protection. I highly recommend this EltaMD UV Daily Tinted Facial Sunscreen. My face does not leave home without it!

An esthetician recommended this sunscreen. For years I used neutrogena but this is an upgrade. I love it. I’ve been using it for about two years now. The bottle lasts me about 6 months or so using it daily, sometimes applying it a few times daily. It’s lightly tinted but nothing noticeable when worn. It’s lightweight. It doesn’t leave a my face greasy/shiny like typical sunscreens, and it doesn’t feel thick and suffocating. I love this sunscreen and recommend it for anyone.

This lotion goes on so smoothly and gives just a hint of color. I stopped using base when i started wearing a mask but this gives my skin a bit of color and great sun protection. Easy to apply first thing in the morning and know i have sun protection for the day.

This has been my go to sunscreen for a couple of years now. Blends well, nice finish, absorbs completely and gives a nice healthy finish (with no scent). I use at least 4 pumps a day and it will last me approximately 2 months. I find it less expensive on amazon than in my derms office.

I have trouble with basal cell skin cancer. My dermatologist recommended this sun screen. Sometimes I but the tinted version and sometimes not. It is not cheap but a little goes a long way. It spreads very easily and I don't have to use as much of it as of other sun screens. I use it on my face. I use cheaper sun screens on arms, legs, shoulders, etc.

I love that this has a slight tint. I would consider myself very fair and this did not look orange after applying and smoothing onto my skin. It gave me a slight healthy glow and covered imperfections well. The sunscreen did not make my eyes water or burn, which typically happens to me! It was very moisturizing and I LOVE that it is oil-free! I can’t believe some other products still contain oil when all it does is clog your skin. This was recommended to me by both an esthetician and dermatologist. I am a loyal customer now .

I live in Florida and the sun is strong, every day. Going to the mailbox requires sunblock for me. eltaMD is easy to use. eltaMd provides a little color while the consistency is light on my skin. No need for heavy makeups to workout The color/tint is perfect!

I bought this product after watching a makeup tutorial on YouTube. Applying this and waiting 10 minutes before applying my foundation gave me a nice smooth complexion and a high level of sun protection. I could have easily worn this sunscreen alone. I did purchase the wrong tint color the first time I ordered it but was able to quickly and easily exchange it with this seller. Be careful to read the tint color to ensure you purchase the right one the first time!

This product was recommended from a Tik Tok influencer and she was spot on with this product. No smell, blends well and the tint is nice. Allow to dry/set and lasted all day on my skin. Didn't fill into my pores or wrinkles.
