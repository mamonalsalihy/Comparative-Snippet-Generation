Color: When looking at the top image in my photo you can see that the tint is not actually my own skin color; however, once fully rubbed in/applied the color does a great job at matching my own skin tone. I can see that this might not be the case with very very light or dark skin, but have not tested this on anyone else to be sure.  Texture when applied: After applying, this sunscreen is not oily like normal sunblocks. Once dried, it has a nice dry matte finish. The matte finish is great to use as a base for applying foundation, since it allows it to stick well without being shiny.  Sun protection: I have noticed that my face doesn't get color like the rest of my skin when I forget to apply sunscreen to the rest of my body. It is a pain that, like any other sunblock, it has to be reapplied often since I persona use it under makeup - which would require another coat of foundation and powder as well.  Bottle: The pump is easy to use and one long pump expels the perfect amount of sunscreen for one face application. The pump is very soft so doesn't require much effort to press. The sunscreen comes with a clear cap that stays on while traveling, but requires little effort to remove. The bottle itself is seemingly well made and easy to use.  Sensitive Skin: I have not noticed any issues with this causing irritation on my skin. Most facial oroducts tend to cause me to breakout, but not this - I have noticed no change in my skin since using it.  Overall: Expensive, but highly recommended by determatologist. They even suggested purchasing through Amazon (vs in office), since Amazon tends to be the cheapest. Great daily product to protect against the sun. I love that I've recently used this on vacation around the pool, and it provides both sun protection and a makeup benefit (coverage isn't the best as makeup alternative, but much better than normal sunblock). I will be buying again.  Update: 1/23/18 I am placing my second order now for this product. I used it 1-2x daily for around 5 months and it just ran out. I am pleased with how long this lasted.  Update: 6/3/18 Yet again this bottle has lasted me around 5 months (slightly less right now as I’ve been using more like 2-4 times daily). Great product!!! Buy now, you won’t regret.  ***Please let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the “helpful” button below. Thank you!***

I work for a dermatologist who carries this line. For those of you who are trouble with the pump...there isn't a traditional pump in there. It works with air pressure (no tubing) If it starts to not work it has air bubbles in the way. Banging on the bottom should alleviate the problem. Hope this helps :)

I've been using the regular clear non-tinted version of this for years and I love it just like everyone else. Never had any problems with the clear version on my acne prone skin. So, I recently thought I would try the tinted version and I absolutely loved it as well. I was surprised because there's never been a "tinted" anything that liked the color and consistency of until this- ***HOWEVER**** I wore the tinted version for a couple of weeks and I started breaking out, badly! I couldn't figure out why every single pore seemed to suddenly be clogged and inflamed out of no where! My skin had been improving so much prior to this point. I hadn't changed anything else in my regimen except switching to the tinted version. I really didn't think it could be the tinted version but I switched back to the clear version just to be on the safe side. Well my skin slowly started clearing back up. Just to satisfy my curiosity I looked up both the clear and tinted versions on the cosdna website (if you haven't used it before it's a wonderful site!) and come to find out the clear version has pretty much a squeaky clean profile, but the tinted version has a level 4-5 flag for one of the ingredients!!!! I knew I wasn't losing my mind and cosdna proved that this tinted version was most likely my culprit for the horrible breakout I had when I used it! Obviously I will only use the clear version from now on forever.

I rarely write reviews unless I really love or hate something. This stuff is amazing. I am 45 years old and have always struggled with oily skin. I have light/medium skin without the need for much foundation. However, I do have HUGE pores. That said, this is an all in 1 sunscreen and foundation for me. I really don't need anything else but a bit of powder to set. I feel like it's so light that I don't even know I have anything on my face. I absolutely love it and that is saying a lot because I am super picky about almost everything! I will be using this in the future for sure. Please do not discontinue or I will cry mega tears! lol.

My skin type: Oily T-zone especially forhead, Dry chin, normal skin type on cheeks, prone to blackheads on forehead and hormonal breakouts around chin during my time of the month.  I do not have sensitive facial skin (although i do have eczema), BUT this product is making my chin a bit itchy, maybe cause I'm dry there? The finish is lovely, definitely that "No make-up make-up look". The first image is after having the product on for about 10 minutes. I would love to make this my go-to, but the Oxybenzone has me on the fence. I'll continue looking for a safer product.  PRODUCT CONTAINS OXYBENZONE - I was hoping it wouldn't. This chemical is banned in Hawaiin sunscreen because it aids in the destruction of coral reefs. It is also absorbed into the bloodstream which will create a harmful hormonal imbalance. Which might be why some people breakout or have adverse effects.

I have just reordered after using this product for 2 months. I have very sensitive skin with large easily clogged pores and have spent a lot of time trying to find a sun screen (and dare I hope) a bit of tint to it. I live in a very hot and humid area so have failed to find anything that will stay on, not slide down and sting my eyes, and not clog my pores, until now. This product is very light, stays on well, and has caused me no problems with my skin. It is a very light tint that blends even with my olive complexion but has enough color to even out my skin tones.

After hearing about this sunscreen from various skincare and beauty bloggers, my sister with significant skin cancer concerns was recommended this product by her dermatologist. I figured it was worth a try, since I didn't have spf in my routine at the time.  So glad I picked it up! This is the only sunscreen I've tried so far that doesn't immediately break me out, even with the recommended 2Tbsp for the face and neck. It says tinted but once it's applied it doesn't seem to have any pigmentation (might help avoid a white cast, but I'm too pale to tell). Very dewy finish. Like, "putting a highlighter all over your face" dewy. After setting with Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, the shine was acceptable but still noticeable if you're into that. I usually also use a matte powder foundation to mattify it a bit more and add coverage.

eos-eos

I LOVE this product! After getting lectured by my friend about the need to wear sunscreen I did my research and bought this. Not only does it protect and moisturize, but it also works as a light foundation-type coverup, which works great for me because I hate wearing makeup when I know I'm going out out the sun. I have sensitive skin and have never had issues, plus this little tube lasts a surprisingly long time. All in all, well worth the money!

eos-eos

I've never used a sunscreen everyday mainly because when i think about sunscreen i just cringe. You think its greasy, smells, thick and leaves a white cast. With age I've come to realize I need to be wearing a sunscreen regularly even if i dont go outside. This sunscreen is not a traditional sunscreen by that i mean its not thick, it doesnt smell and the tint helps so there is no white cast. This is a chemical/physical sunscreen so you do have to apply 15 minutes before going outside but no big deal do it after you cleanse in the morning (and every few hours after). Layers just fine through out day. I dont wear foundation but i feel like this would work really well under makeup. I am med complexion and the tint is perfect for me, melts in and cant even tell its there. Its moisturizing and light weight. Because its tinted it has iron oxides in it which have been shown to help with blue light and photo aging, thus wearing inside while your working is a plus!!! It also has Niacinamide which has helped a lot with my post acne spots and evening out skin color. The finish is not really matte more of a soft dewy glow. I will continue to buy it is worth the money, protect your skin youngsters!

My Doctor recommended this sunscreen and this is my third year I’ve used this product. I have a natural tendency to a ‘rosy’ complexion and this sunscreen doesn’t aggravate that condition. I’ve used both the tinted and untinted formulations and this season I’m more into the tinted. The color is so sheer, so not much difference for me. I have a fair or pale complexion - typically I wear the lightest foundation choice in every product line and this blends right in for me even though when dispensed it looks like it would stand out and create a visible line where the product stopped.  I’m happy with the way this sunscreen spreads and then stays put. It’s not a lotion. Feels drier than that. Once on, it doesn’t seem to rub off. It doesn’t clog pores and is in a small, easily portable container. The rigid container with a solid lid that snaps on makes it easy to tote around - no accidental dispensing. It’s shape, bottle materials and size help make it easy to quickly locate in a bag of skincare items. It is a transparent zinc oxide which for me is a huge plus. You need so little, it goes really far. I didn’t take good care of my skin as far as sun exposure when I was younger but I’m hoping to not pile on in my senior years. Several family members have dealt with skin cancer so I understand the stakes here.  I wasn’t able to find this locally, so I was happy to find it on Amazon and not need to make a trip to the doctor’s office for a restock. The product expiration on my Elta sunscreen orders has always been atleast a year out. Often more.

A friend recommended this product, which was recommended to her by her dermatologist. I'm always on the look out for a good sunscreen so I decided to try it. I LOVE it! I was concerned by the "tint" but I'm very pale and the tint is so it doesn't go on white, it simply blends into your skin. It's extremely light (not at all thick like sunscreens can be) and I skip my moisturizer if I'm putting it on. It works extremely well after spending a day in the sun watching my kid's sporting events. I also have been using it on my daughter (who fights putting sunscreen on) but she doesn't mind this one at all. No sunburn or redness - very pleased.

eos-eos

I have tried many different sunscreens, this may be the last one. It glides on very easily. It looks a little too "glowy" at first, but within about 10 minutes it just looks like my skin but a little better. It does not look like makeup. I can wear it all day comfortably (a first for me). It washes off cleanly at the end of the day. The product arrived clean, unopened and with no apparent leakage.

I've used EltaMD sunscreen now for about 8 months. After coming to him with my first age spot, my dermatologist insisted on me using a daily SPF. I dutifully followed his directions, using a drug store brand. The first product broke me out. The second one created an intense burning sensation on application. The third brand went on smoothly, but ran into my eyes after a few hours. A friend recommended EltaMD. I was hesitant in spending more on a product after trying so many others. I took the plunge and I LOVE IT. EltaMD lightly moisturizes my face, provides the protection I need, and the tint evens out my complexion. The pump protects the product from oxidation and gives me a consist amount until the container is completely empty-- no bottle farts here! One bottle gives me about 2 months of wear, so for a minimal investment, my fair skin stays that way.

I have always wanted an spf that didn't make me break out or make me feel like I was wearing anything at all. Finally I ran into this gem at my dermatologists office. I decided to give it a try. I have cystic acne prone skin. Anything made me break out even though I have used two different acne medications I still couldn't use an spf. This is not only a miracle because of the fact that it truly IS lightweight and NONCOMEDOGENIC, but it WORKS as an ACTUAL tinted moisturizer. It covers up any redness I may be struggling with. I am truly in LOVE with this product. Bonus star for it being cheap online and me not having to drive all the way to the dermatologist to buy it!

eos-eos

I know it’s a little pricey, but it’s totally worth it. I use this every day and one bottle lasts me several months. I work as a nurse practitioner and recommend this to all my patients. I used to avoid sunscreen on my face, unless I knew I would be intentionally sunbathing, because it would be greasy and slimy and make me break out, but this is never greasy and you can’t even tell it’s on your face. Makeup goes on like normal after applying it. I’ve never broken out from it, and I’ve been using it for over 3 years.

eos-eos

Although the other reviews mentioned issues with shipping, I have ordered 4 bottles of this stuff and never had an issue with leaking etc. I have breakout-prone skin and any sunscreen I have used before has definitely broken me out. But not this one! I have both the tinted and untinted versions but reach for the tinted more often because then I don't have to wear any foundation. (Yes my skin is finally clear and I feel comfortable wearing no face makeup!) I love this product and I definitely feel that it does its job!

eos-eos

Just got this a few days ago so haven't got to fully test, but so far it goes on wonderfully. I typically use Kiehls but this seems a bit healthier. It absorbs near instantly, and has a subtle tint (which so far doesn't seem to get on clothes like alternatives have), doesn't leave my face white, has a faint smell that isn't good or bad. Haven't used in the sun yet much but so far I'm thrilled to finally have a product that doesn't have all the down side of other healthy options. This one has an expiration date of a few years so doesn't seem to be a fake as some others have received. The expiration date on the box and the bottle matched.

eos-eos

This is one of the best daily moisturizers- My derm. recommended. I love that it goes on so light & smoothly, the tint is very sheer yet works well for all skin colors/tones & It works very well under makeup ( I am fair/olive toned). This comes in tinted (1 shade only) or untinted, it says UV CLEAR - that's the name, so be sure & choose the one you want. You would never know it has SPF 46!!! I have sensitive skin & hated any sunscreen on my face until this one. It's super hydrating & great for ALL skin types. I used to be acne-prone, now I am dry/combo. I can't live without this stuff year round=) I have bought this from my dermatologist & also Derm Store online; I have purchased from this seller once before & this is absolutely AUTHENTIC legit product.

I break out from all sun screens. When sitting outside I always wore hats and used an umbrella because I couldn't wear sun screen. I relocated to an area where going from the car to the store constitutes sunbathing. After I noticed brown sun spots appearing, I spend lots of money on many brands of sunscreen labeled "For Sensitive Skin." I broke out from all of them. After trying EltaMd, at first during a short duration -walking/hiking- then, all day, I was pleasantly surprised (and shocked) that I did NOT break out! It isn't moisturizing, but I DON'T CARE :) I finally have a sun screen that I can wear. I've recommended it to others - just the other day to my hair stylist who has been going through the same "hunt" for her sensitive-skinned son.

eos-eos

Best sunscreen I've EVER used. I use it religiously. I used to not go outside because the sun here is so extreme. I live in one of the dryest and the hottest state in the USA. My skin looks so bouncy and fresh because I slather this stguff on everyday. The sun will still burn you if you're out in direct sunlight in the summertime in say, Arizona. The stuff is so good, it might as well be called a moisturized as well. But make sure to add moisturizer on beforehand! Let the moisturizer dry (I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream with Hyaluronic Acid for Extra Dry Skin), then apply this stuff liberally. All my life I have struggled with acne, I have really bad cystic acne that is now under control. I've always been looking for a sunscreen that does a few things: 1. Doesn't clog pores 2. Doesn't a greaseball out of your face 3. Doesn't leave that weird white stuff 4. Doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenic) .. Oh wait, I already said that 5. Moisturzes really well as well  MY FACE LOOKS SO GOOD THANKS TO THIS!! OMG !!!

eos-eos

I love love love this sunscreen! It is so lightweight. I can use a ton of it at once and it will still dry down to a natural finish (not greasy at all, but not dry either!). As someone with rosacea, the niacinamide is an amazing ingredient to help with redness and evening skin tone. The light tint just evens it out a tiny bit more. My darker complected friends can not use the tinted version, but this works well on most light skin tones. The tint will stain masks, though! Fair warning. I use my cheaper sunscreens at the beach when I need to reapply more often so I don’t go through a whole tube in one day, but for a daily sunscreen I couldn’t ask for more.

eos-eos

This product works really well for my skin. It smells amazing, too. I usually have pretty sensitive skin and will break out with a new product. I think I broke out for the first week of using this, but then my skin adapted. Now I wear it everyday. The tint is just light enough to fit my skin well. It leaves a bit of a shine on my skin, so I usually put on some setting powder after use. It also worked well as a base layer for other makeup. Highly recommend.

eos-eos

This is the holy grail of sunscreens cause its a mineral sunscreen that goes on so smoothly with no cast at all for my skin tone (I have medium to slightly medium tan with yellow undertones). I also have dry skin but this doesn't dry out my skin and provides some moisturizer which is much needed. Only issues for me is that when i wear a hat and sweat i can see brown from the sunscreen rubbing off on my hat. This lasted about 35 days but i do reapply during the day so I use it about twice daily. This is expensive but is worth it to me.

eos-eos

So this is definitely recommended by the dermatologist and I LOVE it. It goes on SUPER lightweight, which ive never seen in a sunscreen and you dont have to apply another product with niacinamide. It is honestly a little too lightweight to offer much of any coverage as far as foundations goes, but if I put a little concealer and tinted finishing powder on like I usually would with my foundation than I love it for a daily look. Especially during the summer when normal foundation would just sweat off or get gross. Its a little pricey but worth the money IMO.

eos-eos

Beautiful! Lightweight, sheer, no white caste and very light texture. I recommend getting the tinted no matter your skin tone. It doesn't lay down much color but the tint prevents the SPF from giving you a white look to the skin. This formula is wonderful! doesn't make me break out, doesn't irritate the skin and it does not have a strong or unpleasant scent. I also find it is helpful in keeping oil under control. I have used many facial sunscreens and this one does NOT break down make up! if you have Acne prone skin I recommend this 100% I am a make up artist and recommend it to my clients.

I got my first bottle of this from the clinic I get my facials at. I was impressed with how this made my skin look! I have issues with melasma and I notice it was the best it has been in the summer. I still had the discoloration but not as severe. This is a great facial sunscreen. The tint in it is a bonus, it acts almost like a primer and smooths the look of my skin. I can't race enough about this! The tint color is subtle enough that I feel like it would work with a wide range of skin shades.

eos-eos

I love this product; I use it every day on my face & neck whether I'm going outside or not because It works beautifully as a moisturizer ~ lightweight and no oiliness. I have sensitive skin, so I am sometimes loath to use a new product; however, when I last went to my dermatologist, I was given samples of this brand, the only one sold in his office. After trying the samples with no adverse reaction, I bought the tinted and untinted formulations, both of which contain zinc oxide, a key ingredient needed in a sunscreen, according to my doctor. I love these sunscreen/moisturizers and recommend them without reservation.

eos-eos

ive tried like a DOZEN tinted sunscreens but most of them despite claiming to be tinted still left a light residue on my face, NOT THIS ONE. im hispanic with a light complexion thats neither white nor dark and this one blends in with my actual skin tone so well! im super happy to have found this. only downside is that if you don't let it dry properly you do run the risk of getting stain marks on the neck area of your shirts so be carful when putting on cloths or with the cloths you have on if applying.

Sunscreen is so important for protecting your skin and keeping its youthfulness. I trust this product to do that for me. I like that it disappears without any white residue. Not sure it moisturizes since I use a moisturizer anyway. It spreads nicely, too. I believe it is protecting my skin since my dark spots and freckles have not returned.

I have searched for a daytime moisturizer that didn't peel/flake off after "drying" that didn't break the bank for years. I finally broke down and went to a dermatologist and he recommended this and my face feels so moisturized and protected more than it has in years! Also my face seems a little clearer as well!

This product was recommended by my Dermatologist. I get it cheaper here on Amazon than going to the store. It Definitely a life saver. It works very good I know on dark skin. Help prevent hyperpigmentation on dark skin. Also it has zinc which help protect from uv rays trust I live were the sun never gives us a break!!!

This product is amazing. My dermatologist recommended it for my acne/sun spot mottled face. He encourages daily wear, even when not directly in the sun. It feels great on the skin, and provides a small amount of coverage. I still apply a bit of concealer to hide the stubborn sun spot areas, but I see a vast improvement. I have olive skin tone and it blends in wonderfully. I highly recommend this.

eos-eos

I was impressed with how lightweight the product was. It doesn't take a lot to cover my face, and it spreads smoothly and evenly. The tint keeps it from having a white cast, but it isn't enough to really add coverage. I use Retin-A and most sunscreens set my face on fire and causes some drying, but this one did not sting at all.

I've searched for years for a lightweight, bendable facial sunscreen for fair and sun-sensitive skin. This is now my one and only! Recommended by my dermatologist. It dispenses with what looks like a dark tint, but don't fear- it blends easily and I am lily-white Irish. I use the tinted version in summer, and the non tinted in winter. It lasts for hours at the lake, even with water activity. But it also has added skin-benefitting ingredients that help moisturize, even skin tone, and combat fine lines. It's so light and sheer- no white residue whatsoever. You can apply makeup over it during the day, or wear alone to the beach. Gives a very sheer glow that looks young and healthy. I have rosacea, and this has helped even my skin and doesn't cause any reactions. Love the formula!

eos-eos

I really like the sunscreen. But my skin is very dry. I don’t recommend this if your face is dry, it will suck all the moisture out of your face and show every wrinkle

eos-eos

It acts a lot like a light foundation and if you don’t blend it in around your neck and hairline it will become noticeable throughout the day. As long as you blend it looks and works great.

Holy moly! First time using this much raved sunscreen. (I use tinted sunscreen instead of makeup foundation.) I put this on, then started my eye makeup. Within 5 minutes, my face felt stinging and my cheeks burned like it was getting a chemical peel. Had to wash it off right the way!

eos-eos

Most of the sunblocks I have tried are pretty heavy and/or greasy. This one works well, goes on easily and does not leave a residue. You must follow the time line for re-applying. It's a little pricey, but with the tint, it doubles as a foundation.

I have super sensitive skin. Most products I have tried cause my skin to feel like it is burning. This product not only has no unpleasant burn for me, but has a beautiful natural looking coverage and moistures. I recommend this product to all my friends.

I really like this sunscreen. The tint was perfect for my skin tone. It has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid in it, which helps the skin retain moisture. It’s a nice consistency and easy to spread. My dermatologist recommended it, which is a nice plus!

After a recent visit to an esthetician who used a tinted sunscreen on my face, I started searching. I had no idea this was a thing! This product says for acne prone skin, which I don't necessarily have but I am conscious of products that are too thick and clog your pores. This lotion is so smooth and goes on so nice. It isn't an overwhelming tint, it's perfect.

eos-eos

I needed a new SPF for my face that didn't clog my pores after an entire day wearing it. I love how silky this stuff is. Is evenly soaks into my skin, and the subtle tint almost looks like a sheer BB cream. I don't even have to wear makeup over it. As for sun protection, I give it a 4 out of 5. It's nearly 50 SPF, which is great, but after an afternoon in the sun cross-country skiing (i.e. in the snow), I still got a little pink. But for everyday use, this is perfect. Next time I do something in the snow or on the beach, I'll pop on a little stronger SPF on my nose and forehead as well.

I originally had bought this brands non tinted sunscreen and used it as a base and applied make up over it. But I decided to try this and see if I could get away with replacing my foundation on some days. It's not turned into my daily routine since this works so well. Great tint that covers imperfections and is one step and done. This is the only sunscreen I use on my face since I am so acne prone.

I love that this has a tint, its very light and not greasy. I struggle with putting on sunscreen everyday because most leave my skin feeling gross, but i have come to really like this one.

It's winter so I am not getting a good feel for the protective qualities of this product but as it was recommended to my by my dermatologist I hope that it's effective. The five stars are for how easily the product covers and absorbs into my skin. It's tan-ish in tone so you don't get that pasty white look nor will you get the greasy feel/look I've seen with other zinc products. The container is small but it doesn't seem to take much to cover skin. I'll get a better feel for how long it will last as summer approaches. Unless I hit the bottom of the can sooner than expected I'll buy this again.

I love this moisturizer! It is very light weight and does not leave a white tint on my skin. I can use it as primer before applying my make up and I don't even notice it on my face! I have never got a sunburn with it on either. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new SPF moisturizer.
