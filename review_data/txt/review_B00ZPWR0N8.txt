Best sunscreen I've EVER used. I use it religiously. I used to not go outside because the sun here is so extreme. I live in one of the dryest and the hottest state in the USA. My skin looks so bouncy and fresh because I slather this stguff on everyday. The sun will still burn you if you're out in direct sunlight in the summertime in say, Arizona. The stuff is so good, it might as well be called a moisturized as well. But make sure to add moisturizer on beforehand! Let the moisturizer dry (I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream with Hyaluronic Acid for Extra Dry Skin), then apply this stuff liberally. All my life I have struggled with acne, I have really bad cystic acne that is now under control. I've always been looking for a sunscreen that does a few things: 1. Doesn't clog pores 2. Doesn't a greaseball out of your face 3. Doesn't leave that weird white stuff 4. Doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenic) .. Oh wait, I already said that 5. Moisturzes really well as well  MY FACE LOOKS SO GOOD THANKS TO THIS!! OMG !!!

I love this moisturizer! It is very light weight and does not leave a white tint on my skin. I can use it as primer before applying my make up and I don't even notice it on my face! I have never got a sunburn with it on either. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new SPF moisturizer.

I don't really have sensitive skin but this stuff set my skin on FIRE. Hoping it wasn't the true product maybe it had different ingredients in it since it came from Amazon but I'm not sure. I broke out in a blotchy red mess on my entire face and had to wash it off immediately. I read that this happened to others as well but I still gave it a try. I really wanted to like this stuff :( I use super goop tinted glow screen instead now and have zero problems

Es bueno el bloqueador, lo único que no me agrado es que llegó usado, todo chorreado, no cuesta tan barato para que me llegue en esas condiciones o me manden uno usado. No volveré a comprar con ellos.
