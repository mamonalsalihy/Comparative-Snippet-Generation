…otherwise this is a great product. Not sticky or greasy, my skin soaks it up well and doesn’t cause any irritation or breakouts like a lot of sunscreens do to my ultra sensitive skin.

The media could not be loaded. Have ordered this product before and loved it. This time what I received was NOT the Unseen Sunscreen I’ve used before. It is a thin liquid, scent less liquid that I can only tell to be something like water. If you’re shopping, this is a great product but this seller absolutely scammed me, buy elsewhere.  I demand a refund or replacement with AUTHENTIC product immediately.

It goes on so smooth. Love how it feels and looks. Hands down the best face sunscreen that I have found. It does have a little of a weird smell when you put it on but it goes away instantly. It's not scented. Will keep purchasing!

Awesome facial sunscreen. Makeup can be easily added over the sunscreen. This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever used for my face.

Great product to use all year long. A little goes a long way

I love this sunscreen, it goes on real smooth, it doesn’t take a lot either. It is the best!
