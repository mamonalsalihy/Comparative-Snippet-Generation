I will be switching to this product exclusively after my use of it during the Ally 400 in Nashville on June 20th .
It was a very sunny day EDU_BREAK and there was little shade at all .
I am a natural born redhead with very sunburn prone skin EDU_BREAK and this sunscreen kept EDU_BREAK me 100 % burn free .
It was a 110 ° F day at the track EDU_BREAK and humidity was high EDU_BREAK so yes , I was overheating .
But I did not burn .
As any natural ginger can tell you , EDU_BREAK that 's a pretty hard thing to accomplish .
It is important to apply EDU_BREAK as directed to get maximum protection , of course .
I applied more often because of sweat .
My only complaint would have to be the odor but EDU_BREAK considering that EDU_BREAK only lasts EDU_BREAK a few moments and the protection lasts literally all day , EDU_BREAK that 's a very minor issue .

I 've never used a spray sunscreen before , EDU_BREAK and I was pleasantly surprised by this one .
At first though , I was n't impressed .
If you spray it too far away , EDU_BREAK it 'll go on your skin and anywhere else around you ... too close EDU_BREAK and it goes on too thick .
I go with the latter , EDU_BREAK then smooth it into the area of skin EDU_BREAK surrounding that spot .
If you choose to do it this way , EDU_BREAK spray everywhere on one half of your body EDU_BREAK where you 'll need protection from the sun , EDU_BREAK avoiding your palm .
Smooth it around using only the hand EDU_BREAK with which you used to spray .
SPF100 tells you the amount of time EDU_BREAK you 're able to stay safely in the sun EDU_BREAK without burning , past the time EDU_BREAK it usually takes to burn .
For example , EDU_BREAK if your skin will burn in 15 minutes , EDU_BREAK this product will give you an additional 100 minutes EDU_BREAK to spend in the sun ... EDU_BREAK ie : almost 2 hours .
So buy this level of SPF EDU_BREAK if you 're EDU_BREAK looking to have to reapply less frequently . * I did price it out , and the 2-pack of Banana Boat SPF50 costs about the same EDU_BREAK as this does .
So , those 2 cans will equal the same amount of time EDU_BREAK you 're able to spend safely in the sun EDU_BREAK as this one can will allow .
Commonsense will tell you EDU_BREAK that this one is the best value ; EDU_BREAK -RRB-

I wore this EDU_BREAK when I went on vacation EDU_BREAK and never burned EDU_BREAK whereas the much tanner people still did wearing an spf 60 !
As a pale redhead from the north , EDU_BREAK I can honestly say EDU_BREAK this is now my fave sunblock !
It goes on well EDU_BREAK and is NOT greasy at all and dries so fast !
Usually sunblock is greasy EDU_BREAK and makes me break out but not this one . 10 $ is also a super fair price EDU_BREAK and you can get several full body applications .
Redhead approved ! ✅

Best sunscreen EDU_BREAK ever !!!
I only use EDU_BREAK 100spf sunscreen and this is the best so far EDU_BREAK and it has aloe vera in it EDU_BREAK which I love !
I am an African american female with a skin tone NC45 EDU_BREAK and I put this on exposed areas EDU_BREAK only when I go outside EDU_BREAK and take it with me to put on more every 2 hours .
I 'm one of those lucky ladies EDU_BREAK where I dont get a pretty darkened complexion .
Ive seen women EDU_BREAK who get darker in the sun EDU_BREAK and it gives them a darkened red tone and a darker tan color .
When I darken I only darken in certain areas EDU_BREAK and stay lighter in other areas EDU_BREAK which gives me an obvious look of discoloration .
I never just get darker all over my body its only in certain areas EDU_BREAK and it looks like I 'm dirty EDU_BREAK or something so everytime I go outside in the sun EDU_BREAK I put this sunscreen on EDU_BREAK and try to stay out the sun as much as possible and my skin EDU_BREAK has improved EDU_BREAK a lot !!!

We are from Florida , EDU_BREAK so we know EDU_BREAK just how important sunscreen is .
That said , EDU_BREAK we had brought an SPF 50 with us to the Bahamas EDU_BREAK and still ended up EDU_BREAK getting very red - even with plenty of reapplication .
I bought this one EDU_BREAK to take with us to Mexico EDU_BREAK to try to avoid any sunburns .
We may have actually come back with less of a tan EDU_BREAK than we started with - LOL - EDU_BREAK which was fine by us .
We wore this on the cruise ship on the sun deck and at an excursion EDU_BREAK where we were in full sun ALL DAY LONG .
We reapplied once on the excursion .
You may need to reapply more EDU_BREAK if you 're in the water , EDU_BREAK but we had no burns at all .
Very happy with this sunscreen .

Goes on easy , does n't leave your skin greasy .
I even rub it all over with my hands and do n't immediately need to wash my hands EDU_BREAK because they 're not sunscreen-grimy .
Protects my skin like nothing else EDU_BREAK and does n't sweat off easily .
I do n't feel it on my skin , EDU_BREAK it 's so airy .
Smell is n't the best EDU_BREAK but it 's still pleasant and short-lived , EDU_BREAK and thank goodness EDU_BREAK it 's on the fresh side rather than that warm , EDU_BREAK almost tropical smell EDU_BREAK other sunscreens sometimes have .
Blech .
The holy grail of sun protection , imo .
I will never waste money on other sunscreens ; EDU_BREAK they all inevitably disappoint me after this one .

If you are bald EDU_BREAK and burn easily , EDU_BREAK then this is a great product for you .
I drive a semi during the day , EDU_BREAK and am in and out of the truck all day long .
I use it on my bald head and my arm EDU_BREAK that faces the open side window on the driver 's side of the truck .
I apply it in the morning EDU_BREAK and it lasts all day long .
I do n't burn EDU_BREAK and I end up EDU_BREAK tanning very evenly .
I 've used this product for over a decade .
It 's light , clear , and non-greasy EDU_BREAK compared to other products .

I 'm very , very pale with very sensitive skin EDU_BREAK that get irritated by almost any lotion - especially ones EDU_BREAK listed as ` for sensitive skin . '
I am always searching for a sunscreen EDU_BREAK I can slather on that does n't irritate my skin .
I found this product a few years ago EDU_BREAK and it works pretty good .
I 've tried it in a few strengths EDU_BREAK but the 110 is best for me .
Without sunscreen I can start to burn in 10 minutes .
It does work .
I 've worn it out in the desert at high altitudes all day in full sun EDU_BREAK and have come back with no color - just the way EDU_BREAK I like it .
:--RRB- I 've also EDU_BREAK worn it swimming a few times lately - EDU_BREAK I apply just EDU_BREAK before getting in the water and just after .
So far , it 's been working .
Very pleased .
The button is a little awkward EDU_BREAK until you get used to it .
Initially , I thought EDU_BREAK you rocked/tilted the button EDU_BREAK and I always struggled to get any spray to come out .
I finally realized EDU_BREAK you press straight down - EDU_BREAK now it 's not a problem .
It can get a little awkward EDU_BREAK doing it left handed - EDU_BREAK so it does require a little strength - EDU_BREAK but not that much .
So , maybe not so good EDU_BREAK if you have arthritis or other hand issues .
Since it is a spray EDU_BREAK - it 's fairly easy EDU_BREAK to get it on my own back - EDU_BREAK so that is a plus for sports , EDU_BREAK etc EDU_BREAK when you do n't necessarily have a friend around EDU_BREAK to help you EDU_BREAK apply it to the hard to reach areas .
Even after spraying , I always make sure to rub it around for any areas EDU_BREAK I can reach .
Also , you can get it to ` spray ' EDU_BREAK so just air comes out and no sunscreen .
So , EDU_BREAK when using it , EDU_BREAK make sure EDU_BREAK there 's actually liquid coming out - EDU_BREAK if it is n't - EDU_BREAK just reposition EDU_BREAK and press again .
I wonder EDU_BREAK if that is why someone got burned EDU_BREAK using this ??
Same issue with any aerosol - so just use your common sense here .
Something needs to come out for it to work .
;--RRB- Best thing is EDU_BREAK that it is n't very irritating to the skin .
Yes , I still would rather NOT be wearing it EDU_BREAK but it does n't give me a rash EDU_BREAK like some sunscreens do .
And , it does n't feel quite as pour clogging EDU_BREAK as lotion sunscreens do .
Not sure it is because of the Aloe - EDU_BREAK or if I 'm just EDU_BREAK taken in by the marketing - EDU_BREAK but I will take what I can get .
I can reapply many times and not get totally grossed out by it on my skin .

This sunscreen truly is not greasy .
It is dry EDU_BREAK once applied .
I spray amount in my hand then apply to my face .
The rest of my body just spray directly .
It does n't matter how close or far you hold the bottle to spray .
It 's a personal preference .
I have sensitive facial skin .
It does n't sting my face .
It has a very light scent EDU_BREAK that dissipates .
It 's not like the old tanning lotions EDU_BREAK that smelled like tropical oil or coconut lotion all day .
If people think EDU_BREAK this smells or has a heavy scent EDU_BREAK they were n't around in the 1970s and 1980s !!!

After reading in Consumer Reports EDU_BREAK that this was the top rated sunscreen , EDU_BREAK I bought several spray bottles EDU_BREAK to use EDU_BREAK when was at Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert for 10 days .
I spent a lot of time in the sun and , with two applications/day this sunblock worked spectacularly well .
I never burned and , after 10 days , only got a very mild tan .
My skin had no adverse reaction to the spray EDU_BREAK -LRB- this is not to say EDU_BREAK that yours wo n't -RRB- EDU_BREAK and the smell was not pronounced .
This was a very challenging environment with regard to the extreme amount of sun EDU_BREAK and this spray came through with flying colors .
Highly recommended .
eos-eos
I will never buy another sunblock for myself .
I 've always EDU_BREAK struggled with burning , even with diligent reapplication , EDU_BREAK but this is a miracle in a can .
I used it in full sun at Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas EDU_BREAK where I was in the water with fully exposed arms , shoulders , EDU_BREAK and back for 5 hours and only got a little pink EDU_BREAK -LRB- and only because I did n't want to leave the water to reapply . -RRB-
I used it generously EDU_BREAK so I did go through a whole bottle and some just in that day but for the price EDU_BREAK it is worth EDU_BREAK having none of the pain of sunburn .
My husband EDU_BREAK who tans easily used some EDU_BREAK so he would n't burn EDU_BREAK and commented EDU_BREAK that he loved EDU_BREAK that he did n't feel sticky or slimy !
eos-eos
I have always EDU_BREAK heard that anything over 50 SPF does n't really offer any more protection EDU_BREAK but my husband still burns with 50 due to a medication EDU_BREAK he takes .
Tried this out of desperation EDU_BREAK and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked on our recent tropical vacation .
Will definitely be ordering more , EDU_BREAK but wish all sunscreens would move to reef friendly .

Mine shipped as SPF 110 , EDU_BREAK not 100 as shown in the image .
Good stuff for here in the Caribbean - no tanning , no burns , no skin irritations , no bad scent EDU_BREAK -LRB- it does have a fragrance though -RRB- .
Skin does feel slightly slick after application , EDU_BREAK and you do look a tad shiny .
As with most of these sprays , they do n't seem to be pressurized enough EDU_BREAK to give decent coverage - EDU_BREAK I have to constantly shake and hold it upside down while spraying for best results .

I am a super pale redhead EDU_BREAK so I am always great about applying sunscreen .
This worked great .
Had a pool day while on vacation in Tennessee .
It sprayed on really well EDU_BREAK and kept me very protected while in the pool .
Did n't stay out too long EDU_BREAK so I did n't need to reapply .
And my skin was not sunburn at all .
eos-eos
We used a brand EDU_BREAK before that got recalled EDU_BREAK but my husband suffers from over 50 % burn from a fire EDU_BREAK so sun protection is an absolute EDU_BREAK must for him .
I tried several other 100 spfs EDU_BREAK when our last go EDU_BREAK to got recalled .
This was by far the best EDU_BREAK we keep 3-5 cans in the house through the summer .

I originally bought EDU_BREAK this for my trip to the beach next month . . decided to put EDU_BREAK it too test EDU_BREAK this past weekend EDU_BREAK considering all our events were outdoors . .
I put it on every part of my body , EDU_BREAK except for my calf 's cause I had capris on and did n't think much of it ... EDU_BREAK my calf 's are the only thing EDU_BREAK that got sunburned . ♀ I EDU_BREAK applied every 45-60mins .

It 's a little bit sticky like baby oil EDU_BREAK and it does have some odor like baby powder EDU_BREAK when you first spray it .
So I would advise you spray this sunscreen outdoor .
I 'm going to be honest EDU_BREAK that I do n't know EDU_BREAK if it works or not .

I use this on my trip to Panama City Beach and I never received sunburn EDU_BREAK this is the first time EDU_BREAK that I actually found a good product EDU_BREAK that works in last EDU_BREAK and it 's very easy to apply

I have sensitive skin EDU_BREAK so I struggle finding sunscreen EDU_BREAK that protects my skin from sunburn EDU_BREAK without making me breaking out in acne .
This did not irritate my skin EDU_BREAK like other sunscreens have .
This has a lightweight formula EDU_BREAK and I like using the spray EDU_BREAK because it goes on evenly EDU_BREAK and its faster to apply .
Will buy again .

I am very fair skin EDU_BREAK and burn very quickly .
Its been hard to find a sunscreen EDU_BREAK that stands up to the Florida sun , EDU_BREAK but this sunscreen has been great !
Both times I 've used it at the pool and beach EDU_BREAK it has been great EDU_BREAK and truly protected me from getting EDU_BREAK burned unlike some other SPF 100 products EDU_BREAK I 've tried .
I highly recommend EDU_BREAK if you burn easy !

The Caribbean is EDU_BREAK where I want to be .
I often settle for a good pool or beach right here in the east EDU_BREAK where I live .
I am older EDU_BREAK and take medications EDU_BREAK for which I must protect myself from the sun and of course sun burn or sun poisoning or Melanoma .
This does it all at 110 SPF .
It goes on in a spray so easily and neatly .
No rubbing in or rubbing on .
Simply spray .
This makes it so very easy to re apply .
Its just NO FUSS .
Top of the line here on protection .

I like EDU_BREAK that it is a spray and it 's high UV rating .
Did n't know they come this high EDU_BREAK till a friend went to the Bahamas EDU_BREAK and told me about it !!!
Unlike other sunscreen lotions in a bottle , EDU_BREAK because this is n't exposed to the air , EDU_BREAK you do n't have to throw out any unused EDU_BREAK after a year like the lotions recommend EDU_BREAK you do !!
Application is easy EDU_BREAK and lasts a long time , EDU_BREAK just remember to re-apply after exercise or swimming !
