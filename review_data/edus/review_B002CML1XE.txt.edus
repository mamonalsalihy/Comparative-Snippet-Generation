Before you buy , EDU_BREAK just know this : EDU_BREAK All the raves for Anthelios EDU_BREAK -LRB- which started in the mid-to-late 90 's -RRB- EDU_BREAK originally were for the * European * version , EDU_BREAK which contains Mexoryl , a patented UVA blocker with proven track record in EU and Canada .
Mexoryl is highly stable ; EDU_BREAK it does not degrade after hours of sun exposure , EDU_BREAK rendering the `` reapplication '' part of sunscreen nearly moot .
L'Oreal was the one EDU_BREAK to patent and develop Mexoryl , EDU_BREAK which is why it 's only found in L'oreal brands outside of the US .
In the late 90s and early 2000 's everyone was buying Anthelios from European or Canadian sites .
Coasting on this word-of-mouth success , EDU_BREAK the US version was soon launched -- EDU_BREAK but without the star ingredient EDU_BREAK which is so effective .
Why ?
The FDA did not approve Mexoryl as a sunscreen ; Talk to anyone in cosmetic industry regulation EDU_BREAK and it 's well-known EDU_BREAK that the USA is 10 years behind Europe and Asia EDU_BREAK on approving sunscreens .
The list of US-approved sunscreen ingredients is very short and has n't changed in decades ; EDU_BREAK whereas in Europe and Asia the list is longer EDU_BREAK -- they get to use newer ingredients EDU_BREAK that are lighter , thinner , and more absorbent EDU_BREAK -- Another reason EDU_BREAK why EU/Asia sunscreens feel like invisible silk -- EDU_BREAK and US ones tend to feel greasy/heavy .
This US version does NOT contain Mexoryl , EDU_BREAK instead it contains Avobenzone EDU_BREAK -- also highly stable for many hours under the sun -- EDU_BREAK but this formula also contains Oxybenzone , a controversial ingredient EDU_BREAK -LRB- look it up -RRB- .
I 'm not against chemical sunscreens , EDU_BREAK but I personally avoid Oxybenzone as much EDU_BREAK as I can .
However , one great benefit is the milky-light texture , absorbent finish EDU_BREAK that feels weightless on skin .
This is one reason EDU_BREAK why it 's so popular .
If you do n't care about chemical UV filters EDU_BREAK and just want an absorbent formula EDU_BREAK that works great on the face , EDU_BREAK this is a good option .
But know EDU_BREAK that the Euro version is far superior , EDU_BREAK and if travelling outside the US , EDU_BREAK stock up EDU_BREAK -- EDU_BREAK it 's very affordable .

Warning - EDU_BREAK this is definitely not the real thing .
I purchased my first bottle from a store , EDU_BREAK loved it , EDU_BREAK and ordered this one EDU_BREAK when I ran out of my first bottle .
I put it on my face EDU_BREAK and went for a hike , EDU_BREAK and when I came back my face was covered in a weird yellow film .
I tried it again the next day EDU_BREAK and got the same result .
As my final test , EDU_BREAK I went back to the store EDU_BREAK I originally purchased from , EDU_BREAK put it on my face again EDU_BREAK and went on another hike , EDU_BREAK and it was great .
Clearly , this seller is n't shipping EDU_BREAK what they claim EDU_BREAK is in the bottle EDU_BREAK -LRB- at least not in my case -RRB- .
Very unfortunate .

I 've been obsessed with this facial sunscreen EDU_BREAK since my dermatologist recommended it to me years ago .
It 's matte EDU_BREAK and most importantly does n't sting my face the way EDU_BREAK most mainstream brands do .
Excellent staying power through sweat and ocean water EDU_BREAK although I of course reapply after a few hours .
I am very acne prone EDU_BREAK -LRB- despite hitting forty this year ! -RRB- EDU_BREAK but use this on my face EDU_BREAK and neck with no issues .
Love the texture and the small bottle makes it easy to carry with me anywhere

I first received a sample of this in my Allure Beauty Box .
I used up the sample EDU_BREAK as my running sunblock then mistakenly went out EDU_BREAK and purchased the white glue EDU_BREAK that is Neutrogena `` Sheer . ''
My god the difference .
I had immediate remorse EDU_BREAK and hurried to purchase a full size of this Light Fluid .
This is everything EDU_BREAK a sunblock should be .
Light as air , dries to a reasonable sheerness EDU_BREAK and never feels gluey or heavy .
No suffocating white mask of grease and zinc oxide .
I even put on two layers of this for super hot runs EDU_BREAK and it never ever feels like there is anything on my skin .
I am able to put on sunblock powder for my face over top of it EDU_BREAK and it does not ruin the powder EDU_BREAK or brush EDU_BREAK as the others do .
This is quite simply the best sunblock EDU_BREAK ever formulated with so many good qualities EDU_BREAK that make it worth the price .
I will never make the mistake of switching brands again .
I am Anthelios Light Fluid for life !

Best facial sunscreen I have ever used !
I have been buying this product for over 10 years EDU_BREAK and love EDU_BREAK how it does n't sting your eyes , EDU_BREAK does n't feel sticky EDU_BREAK and provides excellent sun covered .
I tell all my friends and family about this product EDU_BREAK and they are all equally pleased EDU_BREAK and buy it as well .
Definitely worth the extra money you spend EDU_BREAK when buying this quality product .

So , I found it a little oily still .
My skin still gets EDU_BREAK that little oily therefore it does n't hold the makeup 100 % after 2 hours or so .
I was about to spend more money on sunscreen EDU_BREAK thinking it would be better EDU_BREAK and I read this review EDU_BREAK that opened my horizons about this site EDU_BREAK that professionals review product .
The site is : EDU_BREAK beautypedia.com / and this is what they say about this product : EDU_BREAK `` This sunscreen skips the ecamsule EDU_BREAK and provides UVA protection with avobenzone .
That 's fine , EDU_BREAK but what 's interesting is EDU_BREAK that not too long ago , Lâ€™Oreal , the company EDU_BREAK that owns La Roche-Posay , EDU_BREAK was denigrating avobenzone in favor of Mexoryl SX !
Why they 're now EDU_BREAK using avobenzone is a mystery , EDU_BREAK but as far as this sunscreen product is concerned , EDU_BREAK it 's an overall dud .
The base formula contains too much alcohol EDU_BREAK -LRB- alcohol causes free-radical damage , dryness , and irritation -RRB- EDU_BREAK and far too little of the beneficial extras EDU_BREAK -LRB- like antioxidants -RRB- EDU_BREAK you should be looking for in sunscreens .
You 'll get broad-spectrum sun protection , EDU_BREAK but that 's about it .
There are far too many EDU_BREAK sunscreens available EDU_BREAK that do not contain alcohol EDU_BREAK and that do contain antioxidants for you EDU_BREAK to waste your money on this poorly formulated product . ''
My next purchase EDU_BREAK based on their reviews will be RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 by Paula 's Choice .

TL ; EDU_BREAK DR : good for daily wear w oily skin , apply moisturizer beforehand First things first - EDU_BREAK I 'm a skincare girly .
And I 'm ADHD , EDU_BREAK so sensory is an issue for me .
I 'm also combination skin , EDU_BREAK so this had to meet many expectations . 1 - EDU_BREAK I know EDU_BREAK the price seems a bit much , EDU_BREAK but trust me , EDU_BREAK this lasts a lot longer EDU_BREAK than it appears .
I started EDU_BREAK using it in may 2022 , EDU_BREAK and now it 's July 2022 , EDU_BREAK and I 'm only just now halfway .
I apply once in the morning , EDU_BREAK and sometimes redo my skincare midday , EDU_BREAK depending on my day .
I 'm STILL only just now halfway through 2 - EDU_BREAK sensory issues .
I previously used EDU_BREAK the LRP melt in milk face and body spf 100 , EDU_BREAK and HATED IT .
I had to wear a mask every day for 3 weeks for AUA clinicals , EDU_BREAK and anytime I took off my mask , EDU_BREAK it looked EDU_BREAK like my skin was peeling off , EDU_BREAK and I gave this spf about 1 hour EDU_BREAK to dry every day .
Now THIS sunscreen , this amazing spf .
It MELTS into my skin with just a few swipes , EDU_BREAK or a what I do , gently pat it in .
Feels like a light oil , does n't have an oily texture though 3 - EDU_BREAK my t zone gets oily as hell , EDU_BREAK so all spfs make me looking shiny asf .
This mattifies down .
I do recommend applying moisturizer before hand , EDU_BREAK and not fully soak in the moisture , kinda needs a primer in a way EDU_BREAK Absolutely amazing sunscreen

La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid SPF 60 , 1.7 Fl .
Oz. , this product is a good sunscreen , EDU_BREAK but it was shipped together with my daughter MCAT books , EDU_BREAK the package was torn up on one side EDU_BREAK it really shows EDU_BREAK that it was returned product EDU_BREAK and the lid was not closed safely to not allow it to come out , EDU_BREAK not much came out EDU_BREAK but it did .
I do n't like EDU_BREAK that it looks like this product was a returned product with the box already open and broken EDU_BREAK and looks used .
There should have been more care EDU_BREAK in selling and sending out these products .

I bought this product specifically EDU_BREAK because I have very sensitive skin EDU_BREAK and have a tendency EDU_BREAK to break out on my chest/neck/face EDU_BREAK when I use sun block for a repeated number of days .
I was going on vacation EDU_BREAK and thought EDU_BREAK I would try this lotion EDU_BREAK because it was for `` sensitive skin '' and `` dermatologist recommended '' .
BOLOGNA !!
I used EDU_BREAK it ONCE and broke out TERRIBLY on my chest and neck EDU_BREAK where I applied the sun screen .
I was on vacation EDU_BREAK and was very upset because of this .
I am not sure EDU_BREAK if I had a reaction to one of the ingredients in this lotion but DO NOT BUY EDU_BREAK if you have sensitive skin EDU_BREAK and break out easily .
Save the money EDU_BREAK and go the Neutrogena Face route ...

This sunscreen has been a Godsend for my dry face this winter .
I apply it before any makeup in the AM , EDU_BREAK it glides on effortlessly EDU_BREAK and you ca n't even feel it on your face , completely weightless .
It has no oily residue , EDU_BREAK no thick opacity sunscreen often has .
The ingredients are minimal EDU_BREAK and what it does have is really good for your skin .
My skin has thanked me profusely for this purchase .
Initially I was bummed EDU_BREAK the container was so small EDU_BREAK I thought , EDU_BREAK `` Woah , this bottle is tinier EDU_BREAK than I thought EDU_BREAK it would be for the hi price '' EDU_BREAK however as I used it , EDU_BREAK it takes very little to cover your face , maybe 5 drops EDU_BREAK -LRB- yes drops , its a thin liquid -RRB- , EDU_BREAK so it will last me a very long time EDU_BREAK and is super high quality stuff .
I intend on buying again .

I have worn a daily moisturizer with sunscreen EDU_BREAK since I was 21 .
However , EDU_BREAK as I 've grown older , EDU_BREAK I felt EDU_BREAK I needed to add an intentional layer of daily sunscreen on top of that .
I tried this product EDU_BREAK after reading EDU_BREAK that it is what TV personality Kelly Ripa , EDU_BREAK who is 50 EDU_BREAK but looks 30 , EDU_BREAK uses .
It goes on very thin EDU_BREAK and spreads quickly and easily .
It does n't leave any heaviness or stickiness .
I truly do n't know EDU_BREAK I 've added an extra layer to my morning routine .
I 'm so glad EDU_BREAK I tried it .

I have crazy sensitive skin to the point EDU_BREAK that I will get sunburned EDU_BREAK if I stay out in the sun for more then 20 mins .

I wanted so badly to like this product .
I ordered it EDU_BREAK and put it on as soon as it arrived .
I went for a quick run EDU_BREAK -LRB- about 20 min -RRB- EDU_BREAK in non-peak sun hours EDU_BREAK -LRB- about 5pm -RRB- EDU_BREAK in OH EDU_BREAK and met up with my husband .
He took one look at me EDU_BREAK and asked EDU_BREAK if I was ok .
Confused , EDU_BREAK I asked EDU_BREAK if I did n't look ok EDU_BREAK to which he responded EDU_BREAK that I had `` bright yellow splotches '' EDU_BREAK all over my face .
Although I could n't feel it , EDU_BREAK I hurried home EDU_BREAK and washed my face EDU_BREAK -LRB- with a white wipe EDU_BREAK so I could see it -RRB- .
Sure enough ... EDU_BREAK neon yellow all over my face .
I am so disappointed EDU_BREAK I ca n't wear this in public EDU_BREAK and have contacted La Roche-Posay with my experience .
Perhaps if you live in a climate with limited sun EDU_BREAK where you never sweat or are looking for something EDU_BREAK to brighten up your entire face/neck/chest , EDU_BREAK this product would work for you .

This product contains two ingredients EDU_BREAK we know to be killing the coral reefs .
They 're EDU_BREAK found in many sunscreens : Octinoxate , and Oxybenzone .

Even if you do n't care about the environment EDU_BREAK -LRB- and why not ? you do EDU_BREAK live here ! EDU_BREAK -RRB- you EDU_BREAK probably are n't a fan of hurricanes , tropical storms , and the resulting floods .
Coral reefs protect our shoes from erosion , EDU_BREAK mitigating the damage EDU_BREAK these storms , storms EDU_BREAK increasing in frequency and intensity .
All rivers eventually meet the sea .
Please skip this sunscreen , EDU_BREAK and skip all others containing the ingredients Octinoxate or Oxybenzone .

My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen .
It smells better than other sunscreen products , goes EDU_BREAK on smooth , you ca n't see it , and no itch .
I mainly use for my face and ears due to a few basal cell carcinoma Moh 's surgeries .
Some other products with high SPF made EDU_BREAK me look EDU_BREAK like I had white paste on my face .
This is a bit pricey but worth EDU_BREAK it to prevent more surgeries on my face .

Great waterproof sunscreen EDU_BREAK that I use for my face and neck all year round EDU_BREAK -LRB- to protect from UVB and also to prevent premature aging EDU_BREAK caused by UVA -RRB- .
It personally does not make me break out EDU_BREAK -LRB- of course EDU_BREAK each skin is different , YMMV -RRB- , EDU_BREAK which is a relief EDU_BREAK because my skin is prone to break out .
It is easy to spread EDU_BREAK and does n't leave a white cast EDU_BREAK as some of the sunscreens do EDU_BREAK -LRB- note EDU_BREAK that my skin is pretty fair however -RRB- .
I put the sunscreen around my eyes and on my eyelids as well , EDU_BREAK if you do EDU_BREAK that try to not rub your eyes afterwards or you may regret it EDU_BREAK -LRB- I personally tear up EDU_BREAK when that happens -RRB- EDU_BREAK .
I am at my second bottle and very happy !

I think EDU_BREAK Anthelios is worth the higher price EDU_BREAK because it lasts on my skin much , much longer , EDU_BREAK according to my dermatologist about 5 times as long .
It 's a thin liquid , EDU_BREAK and a little bit goes a long way , EDU_BREAK helping bring down the cost .
I 'm not sure yet , EDU_BREAK but I think EDU_BREAK it 's not as sweatproof and river water proof as Neutrogena sport , EDU_BREAK but for everyday wear , it 's great !
I 've had a couple of skin cancers , EDU_BREAK and blocking the sun is very important to me .
Another good product in my arsenal of skin saving items .

Used this product years ago EDU_BREAK when I was working hospitality industry - EDU_BREAK it was our company 's best selling product .
Stopped using it cause EDU_BREAK it was expensive for a small bottle of sunscreen .
But rediscovered the sunscreen again at a RiteAid Store in 2012 and EDU_BREAK loving it .
Still expensive but as i get older and my skin changes with age/environment , EDU_BREAK I 've come to realize EDU_BREAK how critical good sunscreen is essential in my life - EDU_BREAK so yes , it 's worth the cost .
Apply it every day under moisturizer on face , neck EDU_BREAK and chest ; so light and non-greasy EDU_BREAK -LRB- very important EDU_BREAK as I have oily skin -RRB- - EDU_BREAK always forget EDU_BREAK I have it on .
I do n't wear foundation EDU_BREAK but apply a light dusting of loose powder EDU_BREAK to keep the shine away - EDU_BREAK oil still sometimes appears but not because I have on this particular sunscreen .
How much do i love this 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid for Face ?
