Received Super Goop as a gift from my niece and REALLY like it .
It 's light & non-greasy .
Goes on almost like a finishing cream under my make-up .
I have sensitive skin EDU_BREAK and break out easily EDU_BREAK but have used this w/zero issues .

This sun block feels so smooth on the skin EDU_BREAK and EDU_BREAK since it is clear , EDU_BREAK there is no white residue left behind .
I also love EDU_BREAK that it is water proof EDU_BREAK and I will be buying this product again .

Would give it zero stars EDU_BREAK if I could .
