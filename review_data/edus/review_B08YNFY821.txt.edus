I 'm whiter then Dracula and just as sensitive to the sun .
I had to apply sunscreen 2 or even 3 times a day .
Now one good application and I 'm a day walker .

Great protection .
I have light-medium skin tone .
At first a white cast but goes away within a few minutes .
Can wear makeup over it .
Does not sting my eyes .
