I love the easy to spray application of this sunscreen .
I was tired of the thick cream and how long it would take to rub it in .
We went on fall break , EDU_BREAK and I knew EDU_BREAK I must find an alternative EDU_BREAK to save our skin from the sun .
I bought various versions of this brand of spray , EDU_BREAK but had to get this one for sensitive skin .
No reactions , EDU_BREAK and it gave complete protection from the sun .
I would recommend and purchase this again .
