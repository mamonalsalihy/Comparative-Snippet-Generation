Not only does it not leave a white cast EDU_BREAK -LRB- I 'm a dark skinned black girl -RRB- , EDU_BREAK it makes your skin glow .
This stuff is perfection !

I was surprised frankly .
I did n't expect much from Paltrow 's elitist brain child .
But I have a condition EDU_BREAK that requires sunblock EDU_BREAK and I walk dogs .
I have a dark complexio .
And hated EDU_BREAK that avoiding carcinogens also EDU_BREAK meant white residue .
I was intrigued by the promise of antioxidants EDU_BREAK and read the reviews .
I tell no lie EDU_BREAK that this is the first time EDU_BREAK that I 've worn a sunblock EDU_BREAK that the sun did n't get through eventually EDU_BREAK and I 've tried SO many all the way up to 100 sof .
I come home with no lines .
It is a little oily at first EDU_BREAK so it 's not dry like Neutrogena ... EDU_BREAK it 's quite nice .
Spend the extra money .
In a pinch I even wore it on my face .
No issue 's at all .

I 've tried every spf spray EDU_BREAK there is EDU_BREAK as this one is definitely my favorite EDU_BREAK thus far .
That said , EDU_BREAK it lasted maybe 3 or 4 weeks this summer EDU_BREAK used 1x daily .
Maybe was to pick up a couple cans or hit subscribe EDU_BREAK if you want this to last .

I started using Supergoop ! 's Unseen sunscreen about 5 years ago EDU_BREAK when another mom gave me a sample .
I 've been hooked EDU_BREAK since because my skin is highly sensitive EDU_BREAK and it was the only sunscreen and La Roche-Posay 's Anthelios line EDU_BREAK that have NEVER triggered any allergic flare-ups on me .
Last summer , our kids had swimming lessons 4 days a week for 3 months .
Their instructors had a big jug of Supergoop ! 's PLAY Everyday Lotion EDU_BREAK that students may use EDU_BREAK if they forgot their own .
I was skeptical EDU_BREAK because it was only SPF 50 .
The kids ended up EDU_BREAK loving the sunscreen , too , EDU_BREAK and even preferred it over other mainstream brands - EDU_BREAK despite it being something I 'd have to rub in on them EDU_BREAK - EDU_BREAK because Supergoop ! did n't sting their eyes , EDU_BREAK it had no fragrance EDU_BREAK that would irritate our skin , EDU_BREAK it did n't feel sticky or heavy , EDU_BREAK and they never burned .
We recently got back from Maui EDU_BREAK -LRB- Spring Break week -RRB- EDU_BREAK and a few days before our trip , EDU_BREAK I bought this two pack spray of PLAY Antioxidant Body Mist with Vitamin C , EDU_BREAK which also was only SPF 50 .
It arrived within 2 days .
My husband is Irish and German - EDU_BREAK he burns lol EDU_BREAK and he thought these were overpriced EDU_BREAK and would n't work on his skin - EDU_BREAK but it did .
He never burned .
But we used up the first bottle after 3 days EDU_BREAK -LRB- there are 5 of us -RRB- .
So I bought an extra bottle of sunblock at the ABC Store with slightly higher SPF EDU_BREAK -LRB- Neutrogena Beach Defense SPF 70 -RRB- EDU_BREAK and we used that for two days EDU_BREAK and it was a mistake .
I remembered EDU_BREAK why I do n't buy Neutrogena sunblocks anymore - EDU_BREAK they do n't work !
They sting , EDU_BREAK they do n't work , EDU_BREAK we burned EDU_BREAK -LRB- and I 'm Filipino ! -RRB- EDU_BREAK and our daughter 's arms and shoulders even burned EDU_BREAK -LRB- and she tans , EDU_BREAK she does n't turn red like my husband ! -RRB-
Even my husband had to admit EDU_BREAK the Neutrogena sunscreen did n't work EDU_BREAK and agreed sometimes things cost a little more EDU_BREAK because they actually work .
So for the remainder of our vacation , we used EDU_BREAK the second bottle of Supergoop ! and we 'll never go back to anything else .
It 's also more affordable than La Roche-Posay EDU_BREAK which I use only on my face EDU_BREAK because they do n't come in bigger bottles .
I wanted to buy the 18oz jug of Supergoop !
PLAY Everyday Lotion for our vacation but it was n't travel friendly .
Anyway , EDU_BREAK if you 've EDU_BREAK never tried Supergoop ! and are still debating EDU_BREAK whether you should , EDU_BREAK here 's your sign EDU_BREAK to just go for it .
Or get several samples from Nordstrom or Sephora EDU_BREAK and try it out for at least a week .

I purchased this product EDU_BREAK because I had another smaller bottle EDU_BREAK and loved EDU_BREAK that so I wanted to buy the full size .
However , I literally only was able to get 5 uses out of this bottle .
It does n't last , EDU_BREAK and feels like the bottle was already half empty EDU_BREAK when I received it !
Unfortunately I do n't trust these sellers on amazon EDU_BREAK and would rather buy from a legit store like Sephora .

I 've ordered this from QVC EDU_BREAK and took it to Mexico .

Best product I 've found .

Easy and clear application .
My 8 year old applies EDU_BREAK without hesitation EDU_BREAK since it does n't leave a residue EDU_BREAK and does n't have any offending smells .
Love EDU_BREAK that it 's reef safe and effective .

I needed a spray sunblock EDU_BREAK that gets my backside EDU_BREAK and hard to reach places EDU_BREAK and will feel sheer .
This one is wonderful EDU_BREAK and does n't leave an annoying white cast on my car seats .
I love supergoop products in general EDU_BREAK and this one is no exception .
The price point is excellent The nozzle sprays well .
I tried another high end product EDU_BREAK and though their product is good - EDU_BREAK the sprayer was hard to depress EDU_BREAK and the spray came out more like a stream instead of diffuse to hit a lot of surface area EDU_BREAK so I like this one alot .
Will purchase again .

I absolutely love this stuff & am so grateful I finally found something that EDU_BREAK : does n't irritate my skin , EDU_BREAK is lightweight , does n't give me a headache with an overbearing scent , is easy to apply , EDU_BREAK is ocean safe , EDU_BREAK and most importantly it is the ONLY one EDU_BREAK I 've ever used EDU_BREAK that I do n't end up still getting burnt on my chest EDU_BREAK despite multiple , timely reapplications .
Please do NOT ever change this product !
I 'm about to order my 3rd bottle EDU_BREAK and it 's an absolute must-have EDU_BREAK where I live !

We all know EDU_BREAK we 're supposed EDU_BREAK to wear sunscreen every day EDU_BREAK but sometimes it feels like a pain .
This stuff makes it quick and easy plus it works great EDU_BREAK and lasts a long time .
It also does n't smell weird , EDU_BREAK which some sunscreens just do .
All in all , this takes all the aggravation out of protecting your skin EDU_BREAK and that convenience makes it 100 % worth it to me .

This stuff is great - EDU_BREAK it actually really does moisturize and protect .
Other spray sunscreen I 've tried , EDU_BREAK the moisturizing and drying basically cancel each other out .
And the scent is not obnoxious .

Not sticky and actually kept my kids from burning .
It is clear .
Great product

A good quality sunscreen .

Skin never felt EDU_BREAK dry or `` coated '' . Once dry could n't feel it .

I received a nearly empty bottle !
This product is awesome EDU_BREAK but I do recommend buying it from supergoop directly EDU_BREAK to receive a better quality item .
I do n't understand EDU_BREAK why this happens to many brands on here ?

This stuff goes on with a light mist EDU_BREAK so it 's not cakey & leaves NO residue , EDU_BREAK which is a big bonus !
It is non EDU_BREAK irritating & does n't leave your skin feeling oily .
All what i wanted/needed EDU_BREAK to justify the price .
eos-eos
It 's expensive , EDU_BREAK but feels so much more mild than typical sun screen spray like Neutrogena .
Scent is lighter too .
Nice !
Worth the splurge .

I have used this a couple of times .
I have very sensitive skin EDU_BREAK and this does n't irritate it .

I had NO burn both times EDU_BREAK I used this .
