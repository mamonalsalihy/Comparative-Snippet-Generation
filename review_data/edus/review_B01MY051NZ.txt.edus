There are 5 of us . . all freckled and light skinned and easily burned . the only time EDU_BREAK we burn EDU_BREAK with this is if we do n't wait at least 10 min EDU_BREAK after putting it on . EDU_BREAK its kinda hard to wait at the amusement park . EDU_BREAK also does n't smell like sunscreen ! my hubby EDU_BREAK -LRB- a mans man -RRB- does EDU_BREAK not feel EDU_BREAK like he smells like a woman either . smells great !
! ps . . EDU_BREAK when we do burn we use - Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless After Sun Gel Lotion With Hydrating Aloe EDU_BREAK And Gel Ribbons , 6 Ounce . . EDU_BREAK even when our skin is almost purple , we only have to use it twice . that night and in the morning . aloe vera gel has never worked well for us EDU_BREAK but this is amazing !

I live in southern Florida EDU_BREAK and am in the sun a lot .
I had a tough time EDU_BREAK finding a sunblock EDU_BREAK that actually worked .
This is the only sunblock EDU_BREAK I have used EDU_BREAK that did n't lead to a sunburn .
I apply it prior to going into the water , EDU_BREAK I apply it EDU_BREAK after getting out of the water EDU_BREAK and EDU_BREAK if I 'm outdoors without water , EDU_BREAK I apply it maybe every hour .
It 's lightweight EDU_BREAK and does n't smell too much .
It does make my face breakout EDU_BREAK which is a bummer EDU_BREAK but it 's better than skin cancer on my face .
I purchased the equivalent spray sunblock in the same SPF and brand for my face EDU_BREAK and I still get breakouts so , EDU_BREAK I think EDU_BREAK that 's just the cross EDU_BREAK you have to bear with it .
It soaks in quickly EDU_BREAK so my skin does n't feel buttered .
I have n't had any issues with sweat / getting sunblock in my eyes , unlike other brands .
I 've tried every brand from the expensive fancy ones to the drug store brands and honest to goodness , EDU_BREAK this is the only one EDU_BREAK that works .

Hands down one of our favorite sunscreens .
While using a physical sunscreen is better , EDU_BREAK sometimes you just want something EDU_BREAK easy to put in that does n't smell or feel like junk .
I would n't recommend using this on the face especially near eyes .
But this is a great everyday option for the body .
I had melanoma in the past EDU_BREAK and wearing a sunscreen daily is a must .
This leave no greasy gross feeling or white cast EDU_BREAK -LRB- since it 's a chemical sunscreen -RRB- EDU_BREAK .

I love EDU_BREAK this product , Here is EDU_BREAK why I decided to give it 5 stars : I am a fair skinned red head , EDU_BREAK I burn VERY easily .
I live in the northeastern part of the US EDU_BREAK and this is EDU_BREAK where I 've used this .
With this product EDU_BREAK I feel EDU_BREAK that it is true to being SPF 50 .
Using this product as instructed EDU_BREAK it does prevent sunburn for me .
I actually get a little bit of a tan EDU_BREAK pushing to 80minutes EDU_BREAK but I 've never burned .
This is also using it while in the pool or lake .
I love EDU_BREAK that this product smells great , is easy to apply , absorbs quickly , is non-greasy EDU_BREAK and is almost my absolute favorite sunblock EDU_BREAK that I own .
That EDU_BREAK being said , EDU_BREAK this is NOT a product EDU_BREAK I would use EDU_BREAK if I was going somewhere closer to the equator .
My skin is too fair , EDU_BREAK I 'd use a higher SPF .
I have n't found one yet by this company EDU_BREAK but EDU_BREAK if they make a higher SPF EDU_BREAK I 'm sure EDU_BREAK I 'll use that too !

I have medium tan skin with hairy legs and arms .
I bought this specifically for my body , EDU_BREAK I 'm usually doing outdoor activities like running or hiking .
I was surprised at how well this sunscreen blended into my skin EDU_BREAK without any white cast .
It also did not clump on my arm hair or leg hair , EDU_BREAK which is excellent .
It applied very nicely EDU_BREAK without making me look greasy .
I personally prefer no fragrance EDU_BREAK but i do n't mind the scent .
It kinda smells like coconut .
It 's also oil free .
I 'm loving this sunscreen so far .
Hope this helps !

This is the best sunscreen EDU_BREAK I 've found .
It did n't have the gross sunscreen smell , EDU_BREAK did n't stain my clothes , and most importantly EDU_BREAK -- EDU_BREAK it protected my Minnesota winter skin from the strong Caribbean sun .
It does need to be reapplied , EDU_BREAK as any lotion would .
I was worried EDU_BREAK an SPF50 would mean EDU_BREAK I 'd get no color at all EDU_BREAK but I did still tan , EDU_BREAK just did n't burn .
It is my go-to sunscreen lotion for fun in the sun !

Consumer reports had this down the list a bit , EDU_BREAK but I 've had great luck with it .
Works great for an overall sunscreen .
Smells coconutty EDU_BREAK and has very subtle sparkle in the lotion .
We are fair skinned , EDU_BREAK so we use EDU_BREAK this then hit shoulders and face with zinc stick .
I would n't use this for a day at Disneyworld or at a tropical resort or a super hazy August day EDU_BREAK -LRB- I would go with the white pasty zinc stuff for that -RRB- , EDU_BREAK but with some reapplying at the lake , beach or pool it 's great !
Also my daughter does n't hate sunscreen with this .

We purchased three different `` reef safe '' sunscreens for a recent trip .
This one was by far the favorite .
We used the whole bottle , EDU_BREAK and barely touched the others .
This one was the easiest to apply EDU_BREAK -LRB- most where thick , EDU_BREAK and gritty -RRB- , EDU_BREAK Hawaiian Tropic was smooth EDU_BREAK and rubbed on easily .
And it has a neutral scent , EDU_BREAK so once it was on I hardly noticed it .
I usually burn easily , EDU_BREAK so I apply sunscreen religiously 3-4 times a day .
Apparently this stuff did the job , EDU_BREAK since I spent a week in the ocean snorkeling EDU_BREAK and did n't get sunburned .

Easy to apply EDU_BREAK and does n't sting .
Our family bought five bottles of this sunscreen for a two-week vacation to Baja during the summer months EDU_BREAK when the sun is ridiculously intense EDU_BREAK -- think 120-degree desert sun .
I thought EDU_BREAK that it would be enough for us EDU_BREAK but we ended up buying five more bottles mid-trip EDU_BREAK because we needed one bottle/person/week .
That was two or three years ago and we 've never used another brand/line of sunscreen since .
Nobody in our family burned using this product EDU_BREAK and it does n't sting sensitive skin EDU_BREAK like spray-on sunscreen does EDU_BREAK and it is easy to apply EDU_BREAK as it 's not super thick and gunky like other lotions .
It 's also rated as `` fair '' on the EWG database , EDU_BREAK which is good enough EDU_BREAK for me considering the price difference between `` fair '' and `` good '' rated products .
eos-eos
I love the smell of this sunscreen .
It 's lightweight EDU_BREAK and does n't feel sticky like some other sunscreens EDU_BREAK I 've tried .
I 've got fair skin EDU_BREAK and can burn pretty easily EDU_BREAK but I can put this on and spend quite a few hours in the sun EDU_BREAK without any issues .
Even when I 'm out for a run EDU_BREAK and get all sweaty , this still feels light on the skin .
I 'd definitely recommend .

We went to Disneyland in 93 degree heat EDU_BREAK and this saved us from that scorching sun .
My husband always burns and this protected us both completely .
So glad I read all the reviews EDU_BREAK and ordered this item .
Thank you .

I love it !
I was using a spray sunscreen EDU_BREAK and getting burned every time .
I started to think maybe I was n't getting it everywhere EDU_BREAK so I thought EDU_BREAK a lotion would be easier EDU_BREAK to see and reach everywhere .
I think EDU_BREAK I was right EDU_BREAK because I did n't get even slightly burned EDU_BREAK and I got a tiny bit darker , EDU_BREAK I feel EDU_BREAK it protected my skin very well .
Also , I really like the smell of it !

I bought this sun screen EDU_BREAK because I was looking for a sun lotion EDU_BREAK that is n't too strongly scented .
I applied this sunscreen EDU_BREAK and at first it has a pretty subtle smell , EDU_BREAK once being on the skin EDU_BREAK it does n't really smell like anything at all .
I am very pleased with that .
It goes on nicely , not sticky , EDU_BREAK leaves my skin feeling nice .
Does n't leave a white residue .
I am very pleased with this product EDU_BREAK and would buy again .

This is the best sunscreen ever .
Good sun protection EDU_BREAK without being greasy and thick EDU_BREAK and breaking out the sensitive skin in our family EDU_BREAK -LRB- even on faces -RRB- .
I struggle to find this product in spf 50 at the store EDU_BREAK but was even cheaper than Walmart here .
Would definitely recommend .

I bought this for a trip to Cancun in February .
I live in Montana EDU_BREAK and therefore I have very pale skin color , EDU_BREAK so the concern of sunburn and sun sickness was very real !
After a week of using this I have some tan and absolutely no burn !
Great product !!

I adore this sunblock !
I burn very easily and am always on the lookout for an affordable sunscreen EDU_BREAK that works well EDU_BREAK and dries down quickly , EDU_BREAK while still feeling nice on my skin . .
This product meets all of my needs and even more !
The scent is n't very strong EDU_BREAK -LRB- like you would expect with many other sun protection products -RRB- EDU_BREAK and this leaves no white cast , very sheer !
I also love EDU_BREAK that it 's cruelty free and reef friendly !
I will continue to purchase this â˜º

I 've used this sunscreen for the past few years .
I am outside all the time .
Not a single burn .
Even EDU_BREAK when I traveled to Costa Rica EDU_BREAK and was out in harsh sunlight for 12 hours/day .
I 've EDU_BREAK compared this product against expensive sunscreens EDU_BREAK and this comes out ahead every time .
Non-greasy , water resistant , rubs into your skin feeling comfortable , and even smells like fresh summer on top of that .
There is no contender for this sunscreen .
Buy this sunscreen for life .

So far so good , EDU_BREAK I recently moved and I spend a lot of my days outdoors , EDU_BREAK I made the mistake of not wearing sunscreen one Saturday afternoon and EDU_BREAK after that went EDU_BREAK and immediacy ordered this .

It 's lightweight EDU_BREAK and smells nice EDU_BREAK compared to others .

I really like the bottle the sunscreen is in , EDU_BREAK but that 's beside the point .
This is easy to apply , EDU_BREAK and has a non-oily feel .
I love the slight coconut smell .
This is the first sunscreen EDU_BREAK I 've used on a daily basis EDU_BREAK since it does n't evaporate and bother my eyes , EDU_BREAK and I 'm EDU_BREAK living at higher altitude now .
I have had very little tanning from being outside , EDU_BREAK so I 'm very happy with its screening ability .

I wear this lotion every day regardless of whether the sun is out or not .
I did some research EDU_BREAK and it has some of the same ingredients as over-the-counter wrinkle creams .
The scent is amazing EDU_BREAK and it makes my skin so soft .
Great price EDU_BREAK for what you get .
Will buy again .

This is actually the first sunscreen brand EDU_BREAK that actuary has protected me from burning .
I have tried up to SPF 100 in every other brand EDU_BREAK and I still always get so fried , EDU_BREAK even with on time reapplication .

Great coverage and protection

I have sensitive skin , EDU_BREAK and had no issues with this during week-long multiple daily uses during a trip to Hawaii .
The scent is amazing - lightly floral/tropical - EDU_BREAK but is not overpowering , EDU_BREAK and fades quickly .

I now use it as my daily sunscreen on my face EDU_BREAK and it works great under makeup or alone .

With many sunscreens I need EDU_BREAK to apply them every hour on the hour to avoid getting burned , EDU_BREAK but did n't feel EDU_BREAK that I needed to do that with this product .
