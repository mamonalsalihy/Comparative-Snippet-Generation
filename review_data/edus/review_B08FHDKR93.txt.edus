The media could not be loaded .
Two of the bottles were defective spraying out tons of liquid instead of a fine mist .
I would have given more stars for the working bottle , EDU_BREAK but it smells like ammonia EDU_BREAK and has a greasy feel to it .

Two of the three arrived damaged EDU_BREAK and would n't spray .
One exploded from the top EDU_BREAK as I tried to spray it , EDU_BREAK liquid went everywhere .
