I purchased EDU_BREAK this product and several other sun bum product specifically for our vacation to Hawaii - EDU_BREAK knowing the rules EDU_BREAK requiring reef safe sunscreen there .
We had n't been on the beach two minutes EDU_BREAK when a representative from a reef protection society pounced us to tell us EDU_BREAK that this product was actually not reef safe as advertised .
They practically slapped the bottle out of our hands .
I did some research on the ingredients EDU_BREAK and found EDU_BREAK that this product has not just one but several banned chemicals in it .
I 'm disappointed EDU_BREAK that sun bum would advertise this as reef friendly EDU_BREAK when it is not .

I LOVE this sunscreen !
My family uses the SPF 30 aerosol EDU_BREAK so this is what my opinion is based on .
We 've also tried the cream , EDU_BREAK but I prefer the aerosol EDU_BREAK because it 's simpler to use on children and easier to dispense just what you need EDU_BREAK and be able to rub it in well .
Pros : - Good for sensitive skin EDU_BREAK -LRB- especially those with eczema -RRB- - EDU_BREAK Wo n't break out acne prone skin - EDU_BREAK Has been great to use on my baby and my face - No burns !
Seems to be decently waterproof - Smells like coconut - Eco-friendly ingredients Cons : - EDU_BREAK Have purchased with broken sprays multiple times before EDU_BREAK and have had to exchange , EDU_BREAK I would buy the lotion bottle EDU_BREAK if you need it ASAP for a vacation or something , EDU_BREAK just to be safe .

I started buying this last summer along with the sun bum face stick .
I hate sunscreen EDU_BREAK but I hate getting burned probably about as much .
I really hate smelling like sunscreen EDU_BREAK and feeling like a grease ball EDU_BREAK dreading the fact EDU_BREAK that my face is probably going to break out .
While this is on the upper end EDU_BREAK of what I really want to spend on sunscreen EDU_BREAK I ca n't help but buy it EDU_BREAK because I honestly want to wear it .
It actually smells amazing .
While it 's still got a hint of `` that 's probably sunscreen '' EDU_BREAK it does n't choke everyone out with `` yep , EDU_BREAK that 's sunscreen '' .
It smells a bit like something EDU_BREAK you ought mix with a bit of rum EDU_BREAK and enjoy by the beach .
With this and the face stick EDU_BREAK I 'm willing to put it on before I hit the sun EDU_BREAK and I 've found EDU_BREAK I do n't get burned !
It 's a great product for those of you like me EDU_BREAK who really do n't like the process of sunscreen EDU_BREAK -LRB- or the smell -RRB- EDU_BREAK but know you want to have skin EDU_BREAK -LRB- and be cancer free -RRB- EDU_BREAK when you 're older !

The entire Sun Bum line has been terrific , EDU_BREAK with this spray EDU_BREAK being the standout !
Great coverage and beyond easy to apply .
Once it was applied , EDU_BREAK I was exposed to intense sun in Cancun .
After an entire week of application , I 'm happy to report EDU_BREAK that I did not burn once .
Wish I brought two cans to Mexico .
Excellent product !

I would say EDU_BREAK this is a good sun screen .
It comes out clear EDU_BREAK so you ca n't see it on your skin .
If you are putting some on your face EDU_BREAK be careful .
I accidentally got some in my mouth EDU_BREAK and it tasted like battery acid lol .
I would put some in on your hands first and then on your face .
I used this also on small children EDU_BREAK and it worked great .

I have a rare skin disorder EDU_BREAK that makes it almost impossible EDU_BREAK to order skin products online EDU_BREAK because not all of these products are honest about the ingredients in said product .
I can say with certainty EDU_BREAK that this product is amazing for sensitive skin , EDU_BREAK it moisturized my skin EDU_BREAK and lasted all day .
I got plenty of compliments from people EDU_BREAK saying EDU_BREAK that I smelt good today .
All EDU_BREAK I had on today EDU_BREAK was this sunscreen .
I work as a lifeguard EDU_BREAK and I am an aerial arts performer EDU_BREAK so I am constantly outside .
This worked amazing with it 's water resistance and longevity .

I have been EDU_BREAK using Sun Bum products for nearly 8 years .
I really love EDU_BREAK that it 's reef-friendly EDU_BREAK and has an amazing scent .
The continuous spray bottle is convenient EDU_BREAK and we purchase a few EDU_BREAK whenever we go to tropical destinations .
The company has so many different vegan-friendly options for skin protection , skincare , and hair care .

This is by far my favorite sunscreen .
It 's the only thing EDU_BREAK that protected my VERY Irish skin in the Aruba sunshine on our last cruise , EDU_BREAK and I refuse to cruise EDU_BREAK without at least two cans .
My fianc√© and I SWEAR by Sunbum !
I would literally recommend this sunscreen to anyone EDU_BREAK who wants to enjoy the sun , but not turn into a lobster ! EDU_BREAK 10/10 is AWESOME !!

I love this sunscreen .
I have two small kids - 5 and 7 - EDU_BREAK and I am always looking for sunscreen with no added chemical like phylalates , etc. .
I usually would be supergoop EDU_BREAK but it 's a bit pricey .
I was recommended this brand by a friend EDU_BREAK and I love the ease of a spray sunscreen and the ingredients here .
Plus , the price is great !

I brought this to the cabin for a weekend .
Everyone EDU_BREAK used it there - for themselves , their kids , my kids ...
My son said EDU_BREAK he loved the smell EDU_BREAK -LRB- similar to other banana-y scented sunscreens -RRB- .
The price is steep on comparison to regular sunscreen , EDU_BREAK but with all the stuff in the news about cancer-causing sunscreen , EDU_BREAK when the can was empty at the end of the weekend , EDU_BREAK I felt good EDU_BREAK that the whole family was protected from the sun and other harmful chemicals .
Makes this purchase worth it for sure !

I am fair EDU_BREAK skinned with sensitive skin .
What a combo EDU_BREAK when heading out to enjoy the sun !!
I 've been using this sunscreen for years now EDU_BREAK and I absolutely love it .
Keeps me from burning at the beach and also convenient to keep one in my golf bag EDU_BREAK when it 's time to re-apply !
eos-eos
Lasts quite a EDU_BREAK while even when EDU_BREAK going in and out of of ocean !
I still reapply EDU_BREAK after getting out even though it may not be necessary .
Smells like a typical spray sunblock at first and maybe has a coconut ish scent once dry ?
Love it !

Bought this for our daughter EDU_BREAK to use at band camp .
I guess EDU_BREAK it worked well EDU_BREAK as she did n't get sunburned .
She used it daily EDU_BREAK -LRB- with frequent reapplications -RRB- for 2 weeks .
We went through about 5 cans during that time EDU_BREAK as her friends liked her sunscreen better than theirs EDU_BREAK since it smelled kinda like coconut .

This product kept my pale and freckled skin pale and freckled after spending a week in Aruba , EDU_BREAK which is18 miles from the equator .
I used the SPF 50 cream , SPF 50 spray , and the SPF 50 sun stick .
I applied liberally EDU_BREAK and it worked .
The scent is very nice EDU_BREAK and does n't have that overwhelming coconut smell EDU_BREAK like most sunscreen 's do .
eos-eos
Great for sensitive skin and pleasant scent .
I like EDU_BREAK that this is reef safe for places like Hawaii EDU_BREAK that require it .
This was great for my kids EDU_BREAK and no one had a reaction .
Next time I will probably get SPF 50 though EDU_BREAK as I felt EDU_BREAK the sun protection on the 30 did n't last as long .
eos-eos
It does n't matter EDU_BREAK if the sun has n't risen yet or EDU_BREAK if it 's raining , EDU_BREAK this is my favorite scent , EDU_BREAK I love it !
It puts me in a better mood EDU_BREAK and I would also definitely recommend it for sun protection and convenience of use .
eos-eos
It sprays evenly , EDU_BREAK without any bursts of product landing EDU_BREAK where you did n't expect .
It does n't leave you greasy , EDU_BREAK the scent is very light and dissipates almost immediately EDU_BREAK so you 're not left smelling like a coconut .
I tried it out on a visit to Tucson in their hot sun EDU_BREAK it did an excellent job EDU_BREAK keeping me from burning .

I love this stuff EDU_BREAK but I was shocked EDU_BREAK when it ran out after the third time EDU_BREAK I was using .
Either someone in my house was over using it EDU_BREAK or it was less than 1/4 full EDU_BREAK when I received it .
Either way ... EDU_BREAK I love this stuff EDU_BREAK but wanted to mention this in case EDU_BREAK someone else ran into this issue EDU_BREAK and I 've never gone through one of these spray bottle so quickly .
eos-eos
Checked expiration and its good for a year and mist is very nice EDU_BREAK and applies smoothly , EDU_BREAK smells like coconut i love it !
I do n't usually get burns anyways EDU_BREAK but this stays on nicely EDU_BREAK without making skin too oily .
Tanned one time for 30 min EDU_BREAK when this was still getting shipped to me EDU_BREAK and i can tell my skin is way less red after EDU_BREAK when i use this .
eos-eos
This stuff works - EDU_BREAK can is super convenient EDU_BREAK and sprays in any orientation , unlike some other sprays .
The product EDU_BREAK itself works - EDU_BREAK spent EDU_BREAK three days at the beach in the sun and a couple of applications per day kept me from being burnt .
Holds up pretty well in the water too . 10/10 would recommend .

Barely let any sun thru !
We were in Mexico for slightly less than a week , EDU_BREAK and came home about the same color EDU_BREAK as when we left , EDU_BREAK despite being in the sun every day !
Non-greasy , EDU_BREAK and held up well in the salt and chlorine water EDU_BREAK even if we forgot to reapply .

LOVE this product .
Sun Bum is my new favorite sunscreen .
Yes it is a little more expensive but worth it .
I am extremely fair skinned EDU_BREAK and burn super quickly .
Not with Sun Bum .
The continuous spray makes EDU_BREAK it super easy to apply .
It has n't clogged on me or gotten runny .
Perfect consistency .
Sunscreen also feels natural and not sticky .
I will buy more .
