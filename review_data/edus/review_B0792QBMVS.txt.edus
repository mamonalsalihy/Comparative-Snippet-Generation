Really like this product .
It is easy to apply , an effective shield against sunburn , and does not run into your eyes EDU_BREAK when you sweat .
I have very sensitive skin EDU_BREAK that has had cancers and i use sunscreen daily regardless of weather conditions .
This sunscreen applies like a stick deodorant EDU_BREAK and contains both zinc and titanium .
However , it does not turn your skin white EDU_BREAK and does not run into your eyes EDU_BREAK when you sweat .
I just recently discovered this product EDU_BREAK and have already a 6 pack EDU_BREAK so i do n't run out .
