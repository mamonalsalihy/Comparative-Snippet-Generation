I am a scuba diver .
I am also a guy EDU_BREAK and guys do n't usually let other guys smear sunscreen on them , EDU_BREAK and being a bit reserved I am lothe to ask a female EDU_BREAK that I do n't know to do this either .
This aerosol spray allows me to get the necessary coverage over my back EDU_BREAK without having to get someone else to smear it on .
If on a moving boat I will move to the stern to apply EDU_BREAK so that I do n't cover everyone else on the boat !
Despite many hours in the sun I have never gotten burned or overly tanned EDU_BREAK while using this product .

Perfect price for a perfect sunscreen .
I love this stuff EDU_BREAK and you ca n't beat this price anywhere .
This was the same price for one container at Walgreens .
Actually EDU_BREAK it was 12,93 at Walgreens for one !!!
I thoroughly recommend getting it on Amazon .
The spray reaches all hard to get areas .

My go to sunscreen .
I live by this stuff .
Use it right and it will protect you completely .
I will ONLY use this stuff in my children EDU_BREAK and I. Coppertone is the only sunscreen EDU_BREAK I trust to protect my children .
I 've had EDU_BREAK to learn this lesson the hard way .
Never again will I use another brand .
I 'm at a loyal customer .

This is by far the best spray sunscreen EDU_BREAK -LRB- and I 've tried quite a few -RRB- .
Living in Florida , EDU_BREAK I 'm covered in sunscreen practically year around .
I 've never had issues with the spray EDU_BREAK can like some other brands .
This has longevity even at the beach .

Bought this two pack for my five day vacation in Cabo San Lucas .
I applied sunscreen every day EDU_BREAK before sitting at the pool EDU_BREAK and walking the ocean beach .
I 'm a fair skinned individual EDU_BREAK and never got sunburned .
I applied another coat of sunscreen EDU_BREAK after swimming ! â™€ One can was sufficient for use by one person EDU_BREAK so I actually had a can in reserve .

I got this for my 2 year old and 3 year old boys EDU_BREAK who are constantly running around naked in the summer .
I tried the baby brand before this EDU_BREAK and that actually turned me off of spray sun screen EDU_BREAK but I decided to give this a try EDU_BREAK and it was soooooo nice !!!!
This will be what I buy every summer !!
Does n't get clogged comes out like a spray EDU_BREAK and is light not sticky .

As far as spray sunscreens go , EDU_BREAK thos one EDU_BREAK is my favorite . in general , EDU_BREAK I still prefer lotion EDU_BREAK so that I do n't end up EDU_BREAK inhaling all these chemicals EDU_BREAK when sunscreening my four kids .
However , I do like this the best of all the sprays EDU_BREAK I 've tried .

I sprayed my shaved head with this EDU_BREAK and sat in the sun for 3 hours .
I forgot to spray the rest of me with it EDU_BREAK so I got burnt EDU_BREAK where I did n't spray EDU_BREAK but my head did n't get burnt at all .
The product works EDU_BREAK well when you use it correctly .

I have purchased this brand on several occasions over the years in my local drug stores EDU_BREAK and a few times i went with `` off brand '' types EDU_BREAK to see EDU_BREAK if I was mostly paying for the brand name .
It seems to me over all the brand does matter in this case , EDU_BREAK and I prefer to purchase Coppertone .
