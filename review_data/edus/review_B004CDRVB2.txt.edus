When it comes to sunblocks , EDU_BREAK Banana Boat is a brand EDU_BREAK that I can trust and rely on as the best protection against sun for my children .
I 've used them ever EDU_BREAK since my children were babies EDU_BREAK and they never had any problem with it .
One time , I bought a cheap , genetic brand instead to save money EDU_BREAK and learned the lesson the hard way EDU_BREAK because it was runny EDU_BREAK and stung my children 's eyes really badly that they were crying in pain .
Ever since then , EDU_BREAK I never even looked at any other brand EDU_BREAK and I just go straight to the Banana Boat .
They are a bit pricey EDU_BREAK compared to other brands EDU_BREAK but you get EDU_BREAK what you pay for EDU_BREAK and I do n't want to compromise my children 's safety and comfort for couple of dollars in savings .
I now buy them during the winter and off-season EDU_BREAK when the prices come down EDU_BREAK since I know EDU_BREAK I will need them in the summer .
So stock them up before the summer EDU_BREAK if you know EDU_BREAK you will be spending time at the pool or beach in the upcoming summer !

Thank you !

This is some of the best sunscreen EDU_BREAK I have ever tried/used .
I have tried them all , EDU_BREAK I am a sunscreen fanatic .
I have tried the most expensive to the least .
I know what to look for .
Mineral sunscreen wise this is my favorite and best one EDU_BREAK I have tried .
I am an adult EDU_BREAK and I use it daily .
The smell is amazing !
The foam application is so easy .
It is spreadable EDU_BREAK and does n't do the piling like other sunscreens .
My all time favorite sunscreen is the Zo Skin Health sunscreens .
But they are so expensive .
I use their Broad Spectrum one EDU_BREAK and it 's mineral just like this one .
The difference ?
It 's far more expensive than the Banana Boat Mineral Foam EDU_BREAK and it 's super white , and not as spreadable .
I have heard the more white in the mineral sunscreens the more protection .
Regardless this Banana Boat Mineral Foam is the best mineral sunscreen available in my opinion .
This is the only sunscreen EDU_BREAK I have ever tried EDU_BREAK that has NO SUNSCREEN SMELL !
I love that .
Hands down the best mineral sunscreen EDU_BREAK you 'll find at a drugstore .
I discovered it at CVS , EDU_BREAK but I repurchased it on Amazon EDU_BREAK because the pricing was a lot better on Amazon EDU_BREAK compared to the drug stores in my area .
Thank you Banana Boat !
This stuff is awesome !
If anything make the blue one smell more blue raspberry like .
Gosh these smell so good I love the Green Apple one .

I have blonde hair and very pale skin .
I never go out in the sun , EDU_BREAK so you can imagine my concern EDU_BREAK upon learning EDU_BREAK that we were taking a cruise to Aruba , Bonaire , and Grand Turk .
I am ghost white , EDU_BREAK but I really wanted to enjoy some time in the sun and the water .
I chose this suntan spray EDU_BREAK because of the SPF and the lack of strong scent .
While I still burned a little , EDU_BREAK it was far LESS than I ever expected , EDU_BREAK especially since I went snorkeling two days in a row .
I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone EDU_BREAK who has very fair skin EDU_BREAK and does not want to get severely burned .
Just make sure to reapply every 60-80 minutes EDU_BREAK if you are in the water .
Also , it does rub off , EDU_BREAK so reapply EDU_BREAK if you dry off EDU_BREAK / wipe down with a towel .

I wear sunscreen on all of my exposed skin every day , from March til October .
It 's extremely difficult to find something EDU_BREAK that does n't feel gross on my skin , EDU_BREAK does n't leave white residue EDU_BREAK on whatever I touch , provides great sun protection , EDU_BREAK and does n't cost an arm and a leg .
I was so happy EDU_BREAK when I found this , EDU_BREAK because it checks all the boxes for me .
It also does n't have any lasting fragrance , EDU_BREAK which is great EDU_BREAK since I do n't want to smell like sunscreen 8 months out of the year .

This is the only spray EDU_BREAK my daughter will let me put on her thanks to the no-sting formula !
As a toddler with constantly scraped knees she hates the sunscreen EDU_BREAK that burns EDU_BREAK -LRB- due to alcohol -RRB- .
She now verifies EDU_BREAK it is the one with the soccer ball each time EDU_BREAK before she lets EDU_BREAK me spray her !
This has been a game changer in the daily sunscreen battle at our house !
I use the stick on her face and neck and spray her arms and legs !

Bought these for vacation / EDU_BREAK the pool time EDU_BREAK because the sun hates me .
I usually lurk from shadow to shadow , EDU_BREAK while under a hat with long sleeves in an attempt EDU_BREAK to only get a mild sunburn for the day .
I get sunburn EDU_BREAK if I even think of going outside .
This stuff works really well as long as it is reapplied often .
Perfect for outdoor use , and for torturing loved ones with a freezing cold mist on their back ! : -RRB-

We are adults EDU_BREAK that love using this product .
It is thick EDU_BREAK and this ensures EDU_BREAK you use the right amount of product to achieve the SPF value .
Like that it does n't sweat off easily EDU_BREAK and the color EDU_BREAK -LRB- that fades -RRB- EDU_BREAK helps EDU_BREAK to ensure to cover up EDU_BREAK and do n't miss any spots .
The fragrance is ok . * tip for use , EDU_BREAK this product will go on best EDU_BREAK if you are outside and in warm or hot conditions EDU_BREAK because it sort of melts into your warmed skin .
Another product would be better EDU_BREAK if you are EDU_BREAK trying to achieve a lot of coverage EDU_BREAK before you are outside , say , indoors EDU_BREAK in air conditioning prior to going outside .

I never liked using aerosol sunscreen EDU_BREAK before I found this brand .
This banana boat sunscreen does the job EDU_BREAK without choking you with aerosol after-fumes .
It 's a good product EDU_BREAK and you wo n't be disappointed in your purchase .

My grandkids love this !
No fuss to put sunscreen on

We start off the day with a lotion and advance to a spray when out and about .
This product is easy to apply EDU_BREAK and does a great job .
Just make sure not to spray into the wind EDU_BREAK -- yes , I 've done it EDU_BREAK -- or near anyones face .
Confession time ... EDU_BREAK we all use it ... EDU_BREAK not just the kids !

My son got a severe sunburn at daycare EDU_BREAK using another product EDU_BREAK and has not had another burn EDU_BREAK since we switched .
Even the daycare staff really like the quality of this product .
It does stay on in the water EDU_BREAK because I had to really scrub it off of him in the shower but well worth it !
eos-eos
I 'm nearly 50 and LOVE this stuff .
Yes ... EDU_BREAK it smells nice EDU_BREAK but the color changing helps us fair EDU_BREAK skinned folks ensure EDU_BREAK we are completely covered .
No more missing a spot !

This is great for women with Melanin EDU_BREAK that do not feel like tanning .
I do n't have a problem EDU_BREAK with being darker EDU_BREAK but it does make EDU_BREAK me have to change makeup shades which is a hassle . . EDU_BREAK but with this sunblock EDU_BREAK I was able to stay in the water EDU_BREAK without being toasted by the sun .
You must apply every 2-3 hours EDU_BREAK but it 's worth it

My mother is pure Irish EDU_BREAK and my dad is english/German EDU_BREAK so I burn even in the SHADE ... EDU_BREAK thia product is a godsend as I direct traffic ALL day in the sun EDU_BREAK and I 'm 60yrs old.wouldnt consider another season with this product .
To me it 's tear free EDU_BREAK as I 've had no issues

My boys are rough EDU_BREAK and tumble all summer long and often have cuts/scrapes/etc .
They HATE putting sunblock EDU_BREAK on because it stings in those spots .
This formula has been great - EDU_BREAK it seems to last , EDU_BREAK it does n't sting EDU_BREAK so we do n't have to cover the cuts , EDU_BREAK and it goes on evenly .
The spray top has n't clogged at all - an issue EDU_BREAK I have with other brands .
We 're happy and sunburn free !

Very easy to put on and leaves no white residue

Love the protection EDU_BREAK while the kids are swimming .
Also one of the best features is it being `` Sting-free . ''
Nothing is worse EDU_BREAK than when the kids rub their eyes EDU_BREAK and they start stinging from the sunscreen , EDU_BREAK and there is only so much EDU_BREAK you can do EDU_BREAK to help them .
This is now my go-to sun screen .

As always , banana boat has a great product .
It works perfectly EDU_BREAK and unlike a few other brands , my kids had no adverse skin reactions EDU_BREAK as they do have sensitive skin .
Not foolproof once wet , EDU_BREAK so I recommend applying at leafy 20-30 minutes prior to getting wet , EDU_BREAK but otherwise a great sunblock for the whole family .

It 's easy to use EDU_BREAK as it is spraying .
Bottle has nice design with cap lock after use .
Nice little bottle wo n't last very long but convenient enough EDU_BREAK to carry in bags EDU_BREAK to use again after two hours .
Recommended !

Being a red head , EDU_BREAK I am always looking for the highest spf out there , EDU_BREAK and this has been the best BY FAR EDU_BREAK that I have found .
I burn SO easily , EDU_BREAK but we bought several of these for a week long trip to Florida EDU_BREAK and I am so glad EDU_BREAK I did .
We spent all day in the sun , every day EDU_BREAK and I never got burned , EDU_BREAK not even a tiny bit .

Banana Boat sunscreen kept my children EDU_BREAK well protected from the harsh rays of the sun .
Even after 4 hours on the beach , the sunscreen kept EDU_BREAK them covered .

I wear EDU_BREAK 50 sunscreen and this product really doesnt sting EDU_BREAK if you sweat EDU_BREAK and it gets in your eyes .
A lot of other products EDU_BREAK that say EDU_BREAK they are for use on children EDU_BREAK do sting EDU_BREAK so it is important to choose wisely .

Went on a multi family vacation EDU_BREAK to palm beach .
I purchased 2 2 packs of this sunscreen for my 3 yr old .
Overkill probably EDU_BREAK but being a single father EDU_BREAK I did n't wan na hear the baby mother complain EDU_BREAK when we got back EDU_BREAK if he had a sunburn .
So I used this on me and my son for our beach and fishing adventures .
My son has tan lines EDU_BREAK but did n't burn , EDU_BREAK unfortunately the other family almost all got sun poison from using target brand .
