I 'd say EDU_BREAK if you havent EDU_BREAK tried Coola before , EDU_BREAK you are still better off buying full size . the only thing of value in this pack in the chapstick .
I love coola , EDU_BREAK but i 'm moving soon so thought EDU_BREAK it would make sense EDU_BREAK to just buy small versions ...
NOT WORTH IT . the spray last two sprays on my chest EDU_BREAK and ran out . the face is a good size EDU_BREAK if you arent using it very often , EDU_BREAK but wouldnt last EDU_BREAK if you were using daily for 2 weeks . better off buying full size or checking tjmaxx/marshalls
