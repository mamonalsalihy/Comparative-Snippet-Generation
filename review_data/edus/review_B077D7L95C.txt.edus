They actually sit still for this !

Yes , the foam smells great , EDU_BREAK and the kids get a kick out of the `` foam '' . However , EDU_BREAK when you start applying the foam , EDU_BREAK the product immediately gets tacky EDU_BREAK and becomes a thick white paste EDU_BREAK that does n't at all EDU_BREAK `` vanish '' EDU_BREAK without risk of giving the kids a rugburn .
There are comparable products out there EDU_BREAK that are just as effective and easier to apply without the gimmick .

Because of the scent and the colors it gave my son a bad rash on the face EDU_BREAK would not recommend using on face and per my pediatrician EDU_BREAK she said ok EDU_BREAK to use on body EDU_BREAK but not face

This spray sunscreen is so easy EDU_BREAK to apply to young kids EDU_BREAK -LRB- ages 3 and 5 -RRB- EDU_BREAK each summer day before school or camp !
Application is so ridiculously easy EDU_BREAK that I ca n't believe EDU_BREAK I was squeezing sunscreen out of a tube EDU_BREAK and rubbing it onto toddlers for the past 5 years .
This is especially great for a kid with sensory sensitivities , EDU_BREAK who can spray and rub in all by herself .
Have n't noticed any sunburns on days EDU_BREAK we 've used it , EDU_BREAK so sun protection and water resistance seems to be good .
