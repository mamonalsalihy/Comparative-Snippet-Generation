really fortunate to come across this sunscreen
it is hard to squeeze out the bottle
not very easy to get on clear tho , super thick
it was a bit bigger for the price
it so far 3 times without any eczema flare ups
the sunblock is old school white zinc oxide , like a 1980s lifeguard
it leaves a very noticeably white film
