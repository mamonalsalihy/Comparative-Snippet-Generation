there 's no difference
it is a little expensive
it takes a while
it does n't cause breakouts
it definitely feels bad
it 's not returnable
it 's not too bothersome
it 's not potent
it feels slightly cooling
it does n't last long either
it was oily
this does not leave a white cast
this is expensive
it is the only item on the market
there is no scent
this does neither
once it 's applied
it dries fast
this is forgiving
this is a bit thick
