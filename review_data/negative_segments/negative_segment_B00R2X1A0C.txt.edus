as it nears summer time
the product does n't feel slimy either
bottle arrived broken on tuesday night
not having spread the sunscreen all the way
people look down on spf 15 lotions
this is the only sunscreen
other sunscreen can take forever to apply
it 's hard to find spf 15 anymore
hard to find these days
only one application needed
hard to find spf 15 in stores
