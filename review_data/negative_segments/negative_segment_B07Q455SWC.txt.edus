it goes on like moisturizer , leaves no white residue
it does not sweat off
it does n't have that gross feeling from other other sun blocks
this sunscreen is expensive
without leaving the white residue
even though this is considered ` ` natural '' sunscreen
still suffered some painful burns
actually work in the future
it was the product
this coola sunscreen smells awful - very chemical odor
this expensive mistake is going straight into the trash
never looked back worth every penny
