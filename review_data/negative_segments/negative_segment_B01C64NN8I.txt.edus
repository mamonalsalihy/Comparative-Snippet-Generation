not a single incident of sun burn
it is a little on the expensive side
like going to the pool or beach for a few hours
it does nt have a lot of unnecessary ingredients
only sprayed for a short one use
the 3rd one does not spray at all - complete dud
one person actually used a cortisone cream
this product is banned in the usvi
