the greasiness subsides
there is no fragrance
it is very dewy
anthelios was the ticket
it was inconvenient
it is often hard to find
it is the first sunscreen
it was thick and hard to apply
it 's not the cheapest option
it was n't enough
this is the only sunscreen
this stuff is bomb
it 's pricey
it is water
it did n't tingle as long
it 's so expensive
as it is says
this does n't feel like a sunscreen
this stuff makes
this sunscreen is the bomb
it is pricey
