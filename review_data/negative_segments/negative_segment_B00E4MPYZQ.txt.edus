the lotion clogs the pores
the wrong spf and the spf 30 is a very greasy sunscreen
about returning the unused bottles in the order
it smells too much like alcohol
it does n't fully absorb into the skin
this goes on like a gel , dries quickly
great product . . never burn
all three bottles had a 6/20 expiration date
it 's non - greasy
also does n't leave stains
one of three bottles was liquid
it was alcohol based
