this is the exception
it was a mistake
until it 's gone
this product was extremely greasy
this is the first sunscreen
it leaves no residue
it is a very thick consistency
it looks a little greasy
it does sting
it does n't leave a white residue
this sunscreen disappears
it provides invisible protection
