there is no stinging
it was greasy
this sunscreen is the only brand
it was pricey
it has no fragrance
this is no exception
this product is a thick cream
it 's not an ideal diagnosis
the consistency was n't comfortable
it 's a little pricey
it will not make a difference
this sunscreen does n't sting
it is zinc based
it is the only sunscreen
it goes away
