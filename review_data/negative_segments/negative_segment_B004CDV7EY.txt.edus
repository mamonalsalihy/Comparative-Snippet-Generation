it is a lotion
these guys are misrepresenting the product
it contains octocrylene
it 's so lightweight
any greasy feeling is minor
it was reformulated
the consistency changed
it 's a bit thick
it does n't smell
it has little to no scent
this is a chemical sunscreen
it does n't sting
it was intended
it blocks the sun
it does n't smell like a skunk
this is the only sunblock
it left an orange stain
it was the only sunscreen
it has a strange smell
