it was chalky
it does n't leave a cast
it is harder
the finish is dewy
some reviews saying
it has a sticky feel
this is the only face sunscreen
it 's pretty near invisible
this product is expensive
a must buy
it is a zinc
it disappears quickly
this product is not sticky
this is the face sunscreen
it 's so hard
