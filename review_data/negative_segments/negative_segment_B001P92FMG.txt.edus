this takes the cake
some wo n't
this applies for all sunscreens
it is not that noticeable
it is smaller
it 's very hard to find
it does n't feel greasy
this is a tad personal
the tube has a small hole
it is very thick
there 's that faint white tint
this is stuff
store brands vary
it is not greasy
it does n't hurt
it 's white and chalky
it also does n't feel
it 's the only sunscreen
it 's kinda thick
