this is the only sunscreen
this presentation has a quimical barrier
it contained zinc oxide
it was misleading
it was advertised as sensitive sunscreen
it 's thick
nothing ruins a day on the jetski like sunblock
usually it would take multiple applications of eye drops
it still stings but not nearly as bad
the pain goes away
without needing eye drops
the only drawback is
it 's very itchy and burning
as it was suggested by doctor
