kids do n't complain
it does n't say that on the directions
no one had any issues
this is the only sunscreen
the chalkiness was minimal
it does n't rub in
it protects from the sun
all non tinted
the white will go away
this formula never changes
this light spray covers thoroughly
it 's pricey
it dries on the skin
