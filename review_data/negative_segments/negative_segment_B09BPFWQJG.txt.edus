the nozzle on the can
it was extremely runny and on the oily side
it did n't meet expectations for ease of use and application
the media could not be loaded
it lasts very long or is very resistant to sweat and water
it says water resistant
like it 's just gone
... also the spray mechanism was n't great
it was drippy and leaky
as with all spray sunscreens , spray it outside
