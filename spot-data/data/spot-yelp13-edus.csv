0,It arrived
0,late  it was sent back
0,and now they are claiming
0,I have filed several complaints with the bbb

0,I really hate to do this 
0,Unfortunately  it was the management and not the lounge
0,The manager ( tommy ) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of ...
0,He seemed annoyed

0,not to worry about bad service

0,Never again will i or anyone
0,Worst time ever
0,A fair warning has
0,Mesquite or no 
0,it does n't really make much difference
0,And it does n't help much
0,to pile on a bunch of junk from the condiment/topping bar
0,I 'd much rather have a burger
0,like they do it at delux
0,when the kitchen applies the toppings for you 
0,all was bland
1,that was good
0,I am rating this restaurant with 1 star 
0,Everything
0,The wings had very little sauce 
0,The calzone and pizza crust were dry  as an actual native new yorker 
0,my fellow new yorkers would be as disgusted with the food as my wife
0,This culver 's has the worse service of any fast food place
0,My passenger actually called
0,culver 's to try to get helped of course
0,Finally took order
0,and when i paid rather than apologize for the wait clerk
0,They make
0,you pull up and than
0,when it backs up
0,Food would have to perfect to make up for the sorry service
0,If you want to be laughed at for expecting even minimal service
1,The hostess was nice 
0,The food was not good  and not worth the money
0,The duck was so salty i could n't eat it 
0,My wife also complained about her entree
0,being too salty 
0,We wo n't be going back 
0,I was diagnosed with food poisoning from organic melons
0,The biggest disappointment is
0,that steve is not an example
0,While we waited 
0,we witnessed
0,each club echelon patron getting
0,packed down to see
0,In my entire life i 've never
0,This is honestly the worst starbucks experience
1,i go here almost everyday
1,because it 's right
0,Although  i 'm
0,I have tried
0,to figure it out
0,A couple times last week
0,whoever takes the orders was trying to be funny
0,and would n't just take my order
0,Every time
0,i get
0,my coffee drink i swear i
0,wo n't be back ...
0,They really need to up their customer service
1,It 's a prime location
0,this place is absolutely the bottom
1,The atmosphere is nice
0,Our server never once asked us
0,if we wanted refills 
0,and it took nearly a half an hour
0,Nope ! 2 workers were in the store ...
0,J and i dropped all the items
0,that
0,if i did n't have that coupon on my phone ( or printed ) 
0,Thus  you need
0,to be sure
0,the guy quickly walked over to the car 
0,"checked  and then instantly explained "" it 's full "
0,I frankly told them
0,They charged me 60.00
0,knowing
0,I bet
0,they do n't make business
0,by doing good job
0,but piling up the profit
0,Take my advise 
1,I found a good plumber
1,after all and i believe
1,While the employees have been pleasant and nice 
0,the hair cutter gal really did a number on my kids hair
0,I did n't realize right away
0,But the next day i knew i 'd subjected my kid to a bad haircut
0,and was kinda ticked
1,was friendly
0,My significant other
0,had her eyebrows slightly
0,butchered here on one occasion
0,like this so good and bad can be gone the next day forever
1,a bonus is
1,that it is located right next to a nail salon
1,so the ladies might enjoy doing something to their hair and then going next door
1,which i like 
1,I still like to shop here
1,since it is my closest big lots 
0,One issue is
0,that they appear reluctant to open up an additional cash register even
0,that this is
0,when other employees  in plain sight  occupy themselves with staring vacantly at invoices
0,as if to not be recruited
0,but it was a slow enough trudge
0,We have also driven several miles to another big lots
0,because the wait
0,I realize the one guy on staff
0,who brings furniture to the front sometimes get overwhelmed 
0,We already burned over half an hour here
0,At this point 2 is
1,that was amazing
0,They stopped doing brunch
0,The service is so-so
0,and actual food is hit
0,We wo n't be back mostly because there are so many other places
1,So the food was okay
0,Here were my biggest problems  1st
0,the plates are to big 
0,The steak is small
0,being a filet and the mashed potato
0,The plate was big
0,and the portion was not 
0,Second issue was the dessert 
1,and that was great
1,They were good 
0,itself is very dry and deep
1,The pad thai was a large portion and the ingredients definitely tasted fresh
0,They do n't accept amex
1,but they were friendly
1,I felt like pizza
0,I was disappointed
0,that the crust was too doughy
1,A fairly well realized monument to unabashed corporate card excess 
0,Food and service are sporadic and a poor value for anyone silly enough
1,My wife 's tuna steak looked pretty 
1,Salmon was satisfactory 
1,A hostess and bartender were both pleasant  charming even 
0,We endured a flowery speech and unsolicited updates on lava cake 
0,until it finally arrived half an hour
0,The whole meal took forever 
1,Paul fleming is a respected restauranteur 
1,and rightly so
0,Dingy inside ... lightbulbs out everywhere
0,including right over booths  extension cords
1,Positive note ; salad and pizza were great
0,The bait and switch  alone  with higher in-store prices then their own website leaves a bad taste however
0,others seem to fear and loathe
1,The food looked delicious 
1,and came out quickly 
1,I was excited for the cheese/prosciutto appetizer 
0,The pizza was equally salty 
0,and to make matters worse -
0,the center was soggy
0,Oh - and as for the wait ...
0,it was about 90minutes 
1,because the wireless is pretty fast 
0,but i am pissed
0,that there policy is to filter whatever the hell
1,and the salads are pretty good
0,They need more booths with outlets 
0,Im reluctantly giving the vig uptown 2 stars
0,I give them 2
1,because they actually have good food ...
0,but their ethics
0,to show up with nothing
0,saved for us ...
0,made us wait an hour ...
0,and we still enjoyed each other 
0,"They didnt even say "" sorry "" or do anything for me"
0,We actually watched our table be held with no explanation
0,Come to find out ...
1,Everyone was friendly
0,but that 's all
0,We had to grab someone 20 mins after we sat down
0,what appears to be our food
0,It turned out to be ours
0,An hour
0,after sitting down we finally got our food
1,It 's a lot of food for the money
0,They were apologetic
1,and food was on the house
0,I do n't have time for this with a toddler
1,It 's kinda euro cool
0,and found them to be lukewarm instead of hot ( plus 
0,they were all foam 
1,They remade them
0,It took forever
0,while we 're doing all this waiting 
0,hanging around
1,this place has potential 
0,We had to remind the waiter
0,twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast
0,The food was equally unremarkable :
0,i had the cheddar biscuits and gravy
0,it lacked seasoning 
1,the hash browns were the best part of the plate 
1,Value : great . ( lots of food for the moo la ... wait is
1,that how you spell it ? ) Atmosphere : ummm ...
0,was overly dressed
1,the hot dog was good 
0,because it was not a good experience
0,and sad we only have the twisted lizzard
1,Service here is always friendly 
1,and it 's a pleasant place
1,as you get more food for the buck 
1,and it tastes good
1,They 've added dessert 
0,Not so good is the sangria 
0,Well  it does n't taste so good
0,It 's too bad 
1,as i enjoyed the meal
1,while it was happening 
0,but this is a risk
1,This is great
0,As with any family-run hole in the wall  service can be slow 
0,What the staff lacked in speed 
1,they made up for in charm
1,The food was good 
1,Both dishes were tasty 
0,that was disappointing was
0,that the food was a a little cold ( lukewarm )
1,I will go back again
1,I went for a team lunch and even with 6 of us during lunch 
1,I am not sure what the entree size would look like 
1,but i am sure
1,although they all look great
0,The one down thing for the lunch is
0,Instead of a meal she ordered just a side of asparagus -
1,it was very good 
0,but at about $ 1 per piece  i do n't know
0,if it could be that good ...
1,my entire salad was $ 8.75 ...
