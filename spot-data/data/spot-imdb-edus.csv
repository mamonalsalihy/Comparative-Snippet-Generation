0,I could n't tell
0,you hate the russians 
0,without warning
0,that we had nothing to fear from the ussr 
0,when the kid stood up with a raised rifle
0,One star (
0,only because imdb wo n't let me rate
1,This show was once one of the greatest nicktoons
1,It was genuinely funny and creative 
0,Sadly  that 's not the case with the mountain of absolute trash
0,Spongebob has been downgraded and turned into a mindless whining 
0,The plots  animation and dialogue show no effort whatsoever . ( i think
0,all the original cast might have left the show ) a prime example
0,of how nickelodeon has sealed its own grave 
0,ruining their greatest shows
0,Finally hitting the lowest level of direct to video hell 
0,the wishmaster is consigned to this awful mess
0,after finding a djinn gem in even a cheaper box than the first three movies 
0,to seduce one of his clients  the typical hot babe
0,The wishmaster then proceeds to kill off everyone in her life
0,The movie also contains a disjointed narrative
0,"I really hate the "" hunter "" character "
0,because first  he kills innocent bystanders as well 
1,The best thing
0,and i do not understand the language i
0,You do n't pan indoors
0,And you do n't put it on a desk
0,Probably the worst thing of the movie was 
0,I do n't know
0,why people should watch this film
1,The original film works
1,because it had all the ingredients
1,to make it great
0,I 'm not sure
1,Queen latifah has proved herself to be a fairly good actress 
0,Instead of giving her character witty and smart dialog 
1,And that speaks volumes
0,Juno is probably the most over-rated film
0,that this film was about a pregnant teenager  i was put off 
1,how good it is
1,it is oscar nominated i
0,i was wrong to ever think
0,Juno as a character is possibly the most arrogant and annoying i
0,would never around like an ungrateful little b ** ch especially to her step mother
0,I also hated jennifer garners character and her husband once again annoying characters
0,as if you should turn this film off
0,that disliked it
0,considering giving it 2 or 3 on imdb
0,Which it was n't 
0,even though they tend to suck
0,There is no gore or nudity and virtually no blood 
1,The plot is actually reasonable 
0,Unfortunately the screenplay is far too talky  mostly risible and the few good lines are generally
0,The direction is ridiculously amateur 
0,turning every scene with action
0,Most heinous of all is the underuse of the sasquatch 
1,The sasquatch is certainly the most likable character 
0,since it does n't have to utter any rubbish dialogue
1,Even though it looks like it wandered onto the set from a completely different movie  its still a likable
0,Still  it does n't provide any reason
0,for watching this one 
0,It makes me sad
0,He never tries to understand them 
0,but always shows in the movie
0,that only he  bill maher  is right
0,""" in my strong opinion "" it is a very bad offense against society"
0,that the movie 's creator miserably fails to understand
0,that religious people have the right
0,You can disagree with religion 
1,This movie is for you
0,if you get a kick out of being offended . ( or maybe it 's more accurate to say
0,being offended . )
0,giving a warning for viewers
0,"who are "" easily offended """
0,gives no sense of what this movie does ;
0,it attempts to offend in a huge way 
0,about watching two men have anal sex in lots of different positions and manners ( naughty bits
0,i 'm having trouble
1,It does
1,A lot of people will go to this movie
1,Yes  there is comedy  some of it quite good 
1,myself completely caught off guard for the hilarity
1,it was easily one of the funniest movies
1,i had ever seen 
1,the concept was likely to be very humorous 
0,but i was surprised
0,Amongst theatergoers (
0,they just threw something together
0,I was left supremely disappointed 
0,A bad  low budget b western by routine director budd
0,scott was simply too old
0,It does n't help that gail russell ( who ?
0,from being a complete loss
0,If only this film had starred john wayne in scott 's role then
0,I had no particular desire
1,Yet  it all started so well -
1,I was just about to think ' perhaps this will be pretty good  '
1,The action sequences were pretty good 
1,building up a tempo 
0,This film is pretty bad  though not as bad
0,Still  it 's probably the worst film
0,But this time  one 'll feel uncomfortable
1,There was actually one great part ;
0,I have no clue
1,The speed boats were fun to watch
0,who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly  along with vince vaughn
0,Sort of bad 
0,It did n't get any better 
0,there was no character development 
0,and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies
0,Do n't watch it 
1,as though it was going to be a really gory ' sword slinging showdown '
0,I was terribly disappointment
0,I hated
0,the cgi blood splatters and bad effects i just lost interest as soon as the blood splattered
0,The random ' demon ' thing
0,that looked like a plastic toy
0,was awful
0,it looked so fake
1,Saya 's acting was alright
0,but alice 's was atrocious
0,This film seriously needs a do over and actually have real blood 
0,I was truly disappointed
1,but i would consider
1,watching another one
0,The pace of the delivery of the lines was hard to get used to
0,and i suspect
0,It 's also very confusing
0,There were at least three times i remember the main character wendy
0,There are a lot of references to outdated things such as patsy cline and the carter administration
1,There are plenty of things
1,There are some funny references especially with a musician
0,Do n't waste your time
0,They 've only made three episodes
0,and i doubt
0,This show belongs on a different channel 
0,but it wo n't last anyway
0,Maybe i did n't got the idea behind this remake of the 1958 classic
0,It all looked very cheap 
0,but by just using the same cheap effects for me it 's a pity
0,The acting was also a bit exaggerated just like in the fifties
0,Daniel baldwin could n't convince me at all but then again 
0,But it is really so slow  too much
0,I 'm not digging flicks from the fifties
0,There are worse things
0,davis had fallen through a time warp to the 1950s 
0,On the negative side is the story  action  editing  cinematography  lighting ( they lit this film for 1950 's film stock ...
0,I felt strangely unfulfilled
0,he seems to be slumming it in this film 
0,He is hardly in the film
0,I really could n't get behind ( or as
1,Billy bob plays a great @ $ $
0,So nothing about the surgery is realistic
0,I know
0,some people like to see crazy
0,and messed up stuff 
0,but this was just boring
0,Most of the sort of tense scenes are all in the beginning of the movie and after
0,that it 's just stupid torture scenes
0,The crazy doctor is basically a douche
0,and looks like one
0,as well  his face is freakishly gross
0,looking as well
0,So basically none of the characters were interesting to watch 
0,most of them are retarded
0,and the characters actions did n't make sense
0,It 's like the director just came up with a idea
0,that is gross but original
0,and thought
1,I love
1,Sets were pretty well done 
1,editing was nice and tight
0,when julia benson is wounded 
0,by bending down
0,Like he has to duck around the sticking out of the middle of the antenna
0,That scene was so painfully  obviously stupid
0,( as was much of the last 20 minutes of the film )
0,It totally spoiled
0,I do n't think
0,this movie ever had the potential
0,to be great 
0,but it did n't deserve to be so badly done at the end
0,why they bothered
0,dropping things
0,and making a mess 
0,Fortunately  it ends with a nice sight gag  but other than that it just did n't seem funny
0,without oliver hardy were bad 
0,Many  like this one  were not especially good
1,but he also made a few very funny films
1,-- it 's a very good stan laurel film
0,The picture was exhausting to watch as over-exposed parts
1,The only thing
1,that seemed okay
0,there is hope for any good actor 
1,I am a fan of joanna pacula 
1,I wish
1,she had gotten some of the better roles in hollywood 
1,because i think
0,But i suppose
1,Meredith and mimi kuzyk did as well here
0,And most of the other criticism i 've read about this film
0,is warranted 
0,And  oh  yeah 
0,The characters in the film all sound like they 're reading their lines from hidden just offscreen 
1,is probably the most energetic performer of the bunch (
0,it 's all pretty stilted and flat 
0,that it was n't going to be funny
1,""" ) lines are amusing at first "
0,but when the actors start winking and nodding their way through every other joke
0,but personally  she does n't have
0,they rushed at choosing actresses and actors
0,Though it added to my collection of funny blunders about russia and russians
0,which hollywood movies are unfortunately
0,abound in :
1,It was a pretty good opening 
0,He is so unappreciated and disrespected in hollywood 
0,is by far the worst actor
0,but the second he tries to show any emotion 
0,Madsen brings down the credibility of everything
1,Living & dying has a great opening and an interesting ending 
0,but unfortunately the middle is just about as boring and predictable
0,I was tempted to leave the theater 
0,I felt sorry for emma stone 
0,Sally field looked like a beggar 
0,I simply ca n't understand
0,I do n't even know
0,I 'm certainly not a fan of tobey mcguire 
0,but andrew garfield is a far worse choice for even peter parker 
0,I ca n't wait for the sequel 
1,The story itself is n't too bad 
0,Every aspect of the city corrupts you ;
1,Gives a good performance 
1,and there are a couple of other decent actors 
0,It 's yet another 1980 's slasher flick 
0,"ground out to capitalize on the popularity of "" halloween "" and "" friday"
0,""" The plot line is typical -"
1,There are some genuinely competent actors 
1,And there is the clever gimmick of the killer donning the costume of his prior murder victim 
1,Almost everybody likes this movie 
0,It does n't really have a plot
0,it 's just stuff bunched up
0,that 's supposed to be fun 
0,You ca n't really care for the people in this movie
0,because most of them just say dumb things
1,The striking feature about this film is
1,It is worth a watch
1,The good reviews both here and from the press further raised my hopes of a return to intelligent science fiction from the ( sometimes fun but formulaic ) action films
0,The science was poor 
0,It is a pity 
1,because the first ten minutes look hopeful 
1,that adds 30 minutes of footage to make this a decent movie 
0,I was totally not expecting anything out of this david dhawan flick 
0,and the film lived up to its expectations ...
0,almost never allowing the movie
1,Sushmita sen has done a great job
1,and looks good
1,as always  salman khan is getting pretty good at comedy 
1,Queen latifah is the reason
0,you might be as disappointed
0,My husband would have bolted after 15 minutes 
1,He did laugh once  towards the end of the movie  at a cryptic comment
1,The movie has some warm  touching moments  with a little bit
1,( very little bit ) of comedy
0,It is just too bland and average
0,Please do n't spoil your perfect holidays
0,by going out of your way
0,"That does n't make sense """
0,to fool around with a gun
0,When jared comes back with help one of the friends is dead
1,This is not a bad movie at all 
0,The idea is overused
0,The twist is predictable 
1,that keeps you watching and interested 
0,you are n't sure
0,I have seen much worse
0,All most from the very beginning one begins to notice
0,that something is not banging away fully with this movie
1,The cast is there 
1,the locations are there 
0,the story  well it has been done  sort of 
0,It was hard to dial in to the movie
0,and it felt
0,The story did
0,seem to presume
0,that the audience knew about the type of people
0,that occurred off screen
0,that just seemed impossible for the on screen characters
1,Easy to watch
0,but it runs to long
0,myself underwhelmed by we
0,I really wanted to care for it more than i did 
1,His photography is lovely 
1,the music by jonsi is wonderful
1,"( especially the beautiful ending song "" gathering stories "" ) "
1,and matt damon 
1,gives a great performance 
0,The rest
0,that crowe does
1,There 's some decent performances 
1,including thomas haden church 's occasional humorous touches  and john michael higgins playing ...
0,But then we also have scarlett johansson 
0,who continues to leave me a bit disappointed 
0,Then we get down to crowe 's biggest issue  his own script 
0,where damon gives a small  cheesy speech
0,and then the film cuts to a small monkey
0,What you might see as a throwaway gag 
0,The movie forces schmaltz on us  especially in the dialogue 
0,complaining about war horse 
0,that 's bad 
0,wait until they get a load of this sucker . **
0,The major plot twists in this movie  as well as most of the plot  is standard fare in science fiction
0,The world depicted
0,is stark with cardboard characters
0,who act predictably
1,While some of this is certainly intentional based on the theme 
0,the rest are due to careless writing
0,Even the technology
0,is very limited and reminiscent of the low detail props
1,Science fiction buffs
0,Too bad  then 
1,Despite the wonderful mood 
0,To make things worse 
0,the previously smart detective behaves like an idiot
0,as if they were simply running out of film
0,and quickly slapped a contrived ending on the film in order
0,The scenes of rape in the film appear to be very exaggerated 
1,Barbara hershey gave a great performance as the woman
0,Ron silver was not his usual sleazy self
1,Besides a sci-fi aspect  there was also plenty of comedy
1,who were supposedly doctors from a university
1,I 've always liked michael keaton 
0,and for some reason  he 's not around as much
0,because she was married to luc besson at the time 
1,The basic storyline is well known 
1,and this follows it
0,After the battles  the story drags
0,It may be better
0,And yet  this video drums it into our heads repeatedly
0,"And especially since the "" ninth symphony ""  admittedly not a ballet but more of a "" circus "" in my opinion "
0,For some reason  beethoven  for all his greatness  seems to be one of the least danceable composers
1,Action packed thriller
0,The film would have been a better one
1,The film does show cohesiveness among the group of narcotic agent police
1,There is certainly a camaraderie
0,I just wish
0,the film would have shown cohesiveness 
0,other than becoming a shooting gallery in the

1,Though she wants to do good in the world
1,and help people 
0,In particular the shaking camera makes
0,me wonder
0,I wanted to slap the director
1,The movie picks up a little momentum in the middle

1,Stephen king fans provide a loyal fan base
0,It still could have turned out to be an entertaining popcorn flick 
0,The pacing is incredibly slow at times 
1,Watching will smith wander through an abandoned new york is cool at first 
0,but after a while you notice
0,that it 's not enough
0,And finally  the ending is so unexciting and dull one leaves the theatre ( or turns out the tv
0,if hollywood ca n't make a good movie out of it 
0,Seriously  three failed attempts
0,it was always delayed
0,Still  we just do n't understand the passion
0,"You do n't see these men "" at war  """
0,you see them in a made up game
1,The story of possessed miria is just so wonderfully murky and sleazy
1,that it truly has to be seen
0,to have one major problem :
1,The script is pure genius
1,The main cast and locations are kept simple 
1,the f/x are n't stupendous
1,but they do
1,the job and the storyline is out there enough
1,If you like movies with heart
1,that just want to entertain you for 90 minutes or so 
1,It 's certainly worth
0,In fact  big scares are n't really present either 
1,that i am a big fan of the nightmare on elm street series
1,Freddy krueger is one the greatest horror characters
1,Although this movie is n't really scary for the exorcist 's standards it still can give you a chill
1,It is purely original 
1,defining an era of horror movies 
1,and giving you a thrill
1,If you like horror movies
1,what you did last summer frightening then
0,I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh 
1,that this movie gets right
1,The scripting and dialogue are strong
1,He did a great job
0,that deal with native north americans always have the negative stereotypes
1,It was great to see
1,that most of the cast were all natives anyway !! :d
1,But i loved that scene

0,because she did n't want the warrior
1,However it was real good to see him trying to save her
0,and the critics ) were n't just ready for this likable performer
1,""" the cable guy "" is a zany comedy "
1,but is also a very dark one with some subversive

1,but many people did n't understand
0,Some have complained
0,in which things take a turn for the seriously dark )
0,does n't mesh well with the first two-thirds
0,The one main flaw with the film is
0,they had explored carey 's character more than just the explanation
1,Aside from it being well made 
1,it is hilarious 
1,most people are looking for .

1,max was n't bad as well  not as cringey as i
1,I loved the huge monsters 
1,It was a sweet film
1,and i liked
1,how there was a calmness to the film
1,The ending was good
1,' knocked-up ' was far better
0,I was not impress with the '40 year-old virgin ' or ' superbad '
0,' knocked-up ' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 year-old virgin ' or ' superbad '
1,but is far more intelligent and witty 
1,It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout 
1,Seth rogen is great as the expectant father 
1,but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality 
0,At times the jokes can be a little too crude 
1,Special mention to the scene in the las vegas hotel between rogen and paul rudd 
0,The one criticism i do have is the last 30 minutes 
1,I respect
1,that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end
1,' knocked-up ' is an enjoyable film
1,and i recommend
1,that you make an effort
0,I was n't expecting anything great 
0,The film can get long at times 
0,and the middle is upsetting during the husband-wife fights ...

1,there is rie rasmussen
1,She is very convincing and
1,and this was shown very creatively in the subtle animation of these characters
1,He played innocent and romantic so well 
1,It is very enjoyable to watch and well worth
1,This was very pleasant break from the consecutive violent movies
0,that karina 's character was over acted
0,and some qualities exaggerated
1,If you are kind
1,who likes a decent movie unlike the item songs types now-a-days 
1,if you like movies
1,that have a little bit of both comedy and melancholy at the same time 
1,If you are the kind
1,who like family oriented movies with a touch of indian culture

0,The pace usually drags 
0,the conclusion is usually bland  especially
1,It is engaging
0,i did n't like
0,was the strange relationship between the girl and the detective ...
0,However  throughout the film there are ridiculous and loud crashes of dramatic music
0,to punctuate scenes
0,There 's a huge burst of melodramatic orchestral music
0,The music portended nothing
0,The music notwithstanding 
1,but mr. skeffington has more humorous lines and scenes
1,I now watch it every easter season and still remained as coddled
1,It boast some of the most beautiful photography
1,lacking in any traditional culture or understanding of the arts  this is a perfect way
1,to expose them to something other than most of the mindless entertainment
1,Anything is better
1,Not to mention this is a very good understanding of potter 's early life
1,"learning nothing but the "" value of their own backyard "" "
1,"or how to "" neutralize "" the enemy "
1,that watch this cry for more
1,that is not so dumbed down that they realize they
1,Second - for all those that love a quality story 
1,Sure the story is told from a more artistic viewpoint
1,Third - since the current ( wonderful ) movies are coming out 
1,this provides a foundation
1,These books provided the foundation of nearly all quality books and movies for the last 75 years
1,One thing i like about shirley valentine is
1,This is a wonderful film for any female
1,It starts off with great dialogue
1,The characters were fun
1,Clint eastwood and morgan freeman had some funny moments together
1,which was nice
1,This movie also has some fantastic morals and metaphors
1,Just everything about this movie had me loving it 
1,Recommended . 9/10 credits trivia :
0,"Yes  this movie has a bit of "" the omega man "" and "" the last man on earth "" in it "
1,which struck a chord with me as i
1,used to own one of those myself
1,So we have some good chase scenes  and some good action 
0,but you also have a couple of scenes
0,that are really depressing especially
1,All in all a good movie
1,This is just a movie
1,filled with a lot of heart
1,He is excellent
1,delivering a movie well done by special effects
1,that was truly heartwrenching was
1,when he survived the attack with the infected creatures
1,Overall at first he has a lot of rage with them
1,but later saved them
1,This is one of the best
1,He really does know
0,this is a remake
0,he was full of rage
1,You are good
1,Sean penn is superb
1,that made him famous are present here  other than his talent
1,he exudes a positive sweetness
1,Josh brolin as dan white  manages the impossible
0,we 're forced to run from event to event
1,to be fair and accurate
0,I wanted more insight into diego luna 's character - the most problematic -
0,and into emile hirsch 's character
1,but the essentials are here
1,History yes
1,As usual  the animation was stunning 
0,What kids ' flick is n't on par with the animation now-a-days  aside maybe the few nobodys
1,The emotion in the film is definitely its strongest suit 
1,This makes up for the rather simple story actually  one
1,And for the record this is probably the only production starring miranda cosgrove
0,not the most stunning i 've ever heard 
1,So definitely check this film out 
1,that viridiana takes in ... some of the best characters in the history of cinema  and some of the best sequences
1,I 'd pay
1,Well  this is a movie to talk about for hours and hours ...
1,Awards are given to mediocrities like martin scorsese etc. ...
1,casting was brilliant
1,both tippi hedren and suzanne pleshette were gorgeous
1,and two totally different
1,I have been in the bodega bay area
1,but it brought in a lot of money and in the process
